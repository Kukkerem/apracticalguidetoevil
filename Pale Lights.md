# Chapter 1

None of the skeleton keys were working. The landlord must have sprung for good locks, which was admittedly sensible of the man considering that Tristan was currently trying to rob one of his patrons.

“You should have started with the lockpicks,” Fortuna said. “Told you, didn’t I?”

She was leaning against a dingy wall in the weak light of the sole lantern in the hallway, long red dress sweeping to the ground and her tone openly bored. She’d not lowered her voice in the slightest, which would have risked waking up their friend on the other side of the door if anyone but Tristan could hear her. They couldn’t, anymore than they could see or touch her – Fortuna herself still had the senses, but she had grown far too weak to touch the material world. As far as he knew Tristan Abrascal was the sole contractor to the Lady of Long Odds in all of Vesper, and he knew much. Fortuna was not the kind of goddess that disliked the sound of her own voice.

“And to think I was once mistress of queens and emperors. Entire festivals were thrown to earn even a single approving glance from me, Tristan,” Fortuna mourned. “Now all I may call on is a single orphan, one with terribly middling thieving skills.”

He rolled his eyes. All the old gods like to claim they had once been the greatest deity to ever crawl out of the ether to make pacts with men – or even rule over them, back in the times of the Old Night – but in his experience most of them were no more glorious than the dusty thieves and beggars of the Murk they made contracts with.  

“Love you too,” Tristan murmured back as he reached for the lockpicks.

Mere possession of that neat leather sheath would be enough to earn him a whipping before he was thrown into a cell, should the Guardia catch him with it. Not that they ever had. He opened it to reveal a well-oiled set of tools, one which he knew to be starkly expensive when crafted with such quality. They’d been a gift from Abuela, though like all her gifts he’d had to earn it on his own. He slowly inserted the tension wrench into the lock, as not to make enough noise to wake the man on the other side of the door, and began to work the pick. Quickly he raised an eyebrow.

The landlord of the Azulejo was a wealthy man, for the hostel was the largest in all of Estebra District and Estebra was by far the wealthiest of the half-dozen districts known as the Murk. It seemed, however, that in this instance the size of the establishment had worked against the landlord. Almost a hundred rooms meant that it would have cost a king’s ransom to have good locks on every door unless they were bought in bulk from one of the great workshops. Those mass models were identical: even the good ones all had the same weaknesses. Fortuna, resting a hand on the wall, leaned over his shoulder to have a closer look. He could feel her breath against his cheek, warm and soft.

An illusion, he thought, but one so convincing as to outstrip even the truth.

“A Gongmin lock?” the goddess asked. “You know those. What’s taking you so-”

With a muted sound – thank the gods for whichever servant was being dutiful about keeping these well-oiled – the lock popped open. He offered Fortuna an angelic smile, to which she rolled her eyes. The goddess could be considered a great beauty, he knew, with those shimmering eyes and that hair of gold, yet even as a young boy he’d not been fooled by her appearance. The Lady of Long Odds was essentially a collection of terrible habits made into a deity, after all, and she was not particularly good at hiding this. Not that Tristan minded. His was not the kind of life that some ancient and glorious Mane would have ever deigned to grace with a pact, much less one as close and intimate as the one he shared with Fortuna. Besides, the mere thought of being bound to one of those pristine old monsters was enough to sicken him. Let the infanzones keep the privilege, may they choke on it and each other.

The tools went back into the sheath and Tristan folded it closed before stashing it away in the stitched inner pocket of his coat. He made sure that the skeleton keys he’d put away in another pocket were still wedged among feathers, so that they would not make noise as he moved, and then laid a finger on handle of the blackjack at his hip. He did not like killing, not strangers anyway, which was why he preferred it to the knives most in his trade used. The small weapon of leather and lead was a good fit for his hand, and he’d had practice with it, though if Tristan had his way there would be no violence tonight. In and out with the cabinet he’d come to steal, the man in the room none the wiser until tomorrow. Ideally. Tonight, however, was a test of Abuela’s.

Those did not tend to be painless, for all that they inevitably ended up teaching him valuable lessons.

Tristan slowly cracked the door open, a sliver of dim light from the lantern in the hall slinking through into the dark. He’d looked into other rooms over the last few days so that he would know where the beds and tables were positioned, and from what he could see through the crack there had been no change in arrangement. The table was in the corner to the right, with a single chair, which meant the bed ought to be just outside his angle of sight: left corner, close to but not outright propped against the wall. From the corner of his eye he saw Fortuna wink at him and he smiled back. She’d earlier agreed to keep watch outside the room, after some wheedling.

Tristan opened the door a little wider, crept through and then softly closed it behind him. The young thief waited silently until his eyes got used to the darkness, pricking his ears. The steady breath of a sleeping man was all he heard, along with a body moving around under covers. The room itself was fairly bare. On the right there was the table and chair he had glimpsed earlier, with what looked to be a few papers and a writing kit. On the left there was the bed, a wooden frame with a straw mattress. At its foot was a trunk provided for the guests to stash their personal affairs. Tristan saw a pistol and arming sword placed atop it, over a half-folded black cloak. The last detail had him going still as a stone. The sleeping man was one of the Watch?

If so, this was turning out to be a blunder. Stealing from a blackcloak was a bad idea even at the best of times, for they were talented killers one and all, but if it turned out that Tristan was obstructing a contract then it wouldn’t be the man alone that came for him: the entire free company he belonged to would become involved. Even worse, it was said that the Watch was bound by ancient treaty never to take contracts within Sacromonte save at the invitation of the infanzones so he must have stumb- his thoughts halted, and the young thief turned a considering eye to the sleeping man. It was Abuela that had sent him on this test, he had forgot in his surprise, and Tristan had long suspected that Abuela herself was one of the Watch.

There must be more to this than met the eye. And if the man was here on a contract, why was he alone? The infanzones, the nobles that ruled Sacromonte, they had their favourite companies to contract with when they needed work done in the City. None of those companies were small, each storied and famous and near an army in its own right. And none of them would put up one of their men in a place like the Azulejo, Tristan thought. So was the man here on private business? No, the thief decided, else he would not have dared to bring with him the black cloak that was as a badge of office for the Watch. Tristan’s eyes narrowed. He had only suppositions, but too many details were not adding up.

His gut was saying deserter and Tristan Abrascal trusted his gut.

Which meant he was now free to steal from the stranger once more, if a great deal more warily. A deserter’s knife would kill him just as dead if it slipped through his ribs. From the corner of his eye he saw that Fortuna had gotten bored of keeping an eye out for him and followed him into the room. He swallowed a sigh at the sight of her curiously peering at the papers on the table: it’d only been a matter of time until she wandered off, though he’d hoped for a little longer. The goddess glanced his way, crooking a finger to summon him, but he shook his head. He’d come for the cabinet Abuela had sent him after, nothing else. No good would come of getting involved in Watch business any more than he already was.

He wasn’t seeing said cabinet, unfortunately, but then he’d not moved much. He crept a little deeper into the room, eyes seeking, and found what he was looking for but a few moments later: bare as the rented room was, there were no real hiding places to speak of. The cabinet had simply been nestled by the side of the trunk, half-covered by the cloak. It was easy to recognize from the description he’d been given, slick dark wood with leather stripes to make it easy to carry on one’s back and burnished copper hinges. Inside were pieces of glass and metal, Abuela had said, so he would need to be careful when moving it lest it make a ruckus. Fortuna was looking his way still, insistently gesturing for him to come at her side, but he shook his head at her with growing irritation.

He crept closer to the foot of the bed, angling so that the trunk would hide him as he began to grasp the wooden cabinet. A tentative nudge established it was not all that heavy, intriguingly enough, so Tristan quieted his breath and slid aside the edge of the cloak so that he could begin moving the chest without dragging the black wool with it.

“Tristan, you need to read this,” Fortuna quietly said. “The man is on a contract.”

The young thief turned in startlement, finding the goddess’ face grown grave in the dark. He noticed, a heartbeat too late, that her eyes were going wide. The cold muzzle of a pistol touched the back of his neck.

“A thief, are you?”

The voice was calm but anger lurked close to the surface. The Aztlan accent was faint but noticeable, mostly in the way that the words clicked against the tongue. Tristan swallowed, then painted a winning smile on his face. He was not yet dead, which meant there was still time to dig himself out of the grave he’d dug himself into.

“All men are thieves, arguably,” he replied. “It is only that the rich name it rent or tax instead, so that we might forget what it is.”

A snort of reluctant amusement.

“So you’re a Republican thief.”

Presumably the man meant in political philosophy rather than race, as even in the dark it would be difficult for Tristan to pass as Tianxi.

“Nothing so grand,” Tristan denied. “I am a loyal son of Sacromonte, sir. My faith goes to the Law of Rats.”

The hungry bite, the beggared snatch, the cornered fight. So went the Law of Rats, as written in the famous poetess Ilaria’s verse. There was not a soul in the city that had not heard the poem and to many of the Murk it was as much the writ of the world as any decree of the infanzones. Tristan made to turn, to have a better look at the man holding a pistol to his neck, but the stranger clicked his tongue disapprovingly.

“None of that,” the watchman said. “Not unless you want the trigger pulled.”

Tristan went still. In front of him Fortuna stood, eyeing the man and shaking her head. The stranger was not bluffing, the pistol was fully cocked.

“It may be that you are of the City,” the man said, “but this is not petty theft. The room has a good lock and I do not have the looks of an easy or wealthy mark. What are you here after, boy?”

Tristan hesitated.

“So you were sent,” the man stated, tone confident.

Too confident, really, the young thief frowned. He glanced at Fortuna, who had no answer to give save a grimace. Did the other man possess a contract with a god as well? If so, this conversation was even more dangerous than he’d thought and it had begun with a pistol pressed against his neck.

“Who was it that did the sending?” the man asked. “Give me a name and you won’t need to die tonight. It’s your master that is my foe, not you.”

Maybe if he’d been looking at the face, it would have made a difference. Tristan would have been able to see the Aztlan features, the darker skin and broad chin. It wouldn’t have been the voice alone, speaking words he’d heard before. Maybe not the same, not exactly, but didn’t they all mean the same thing? Landlords and bosses and infanzones, all looking down from across the table with that merciful smile. Just give us names, they asked. You will be spared, forgiven, absolved. But give us the names. Give us your cousins and your neighbours and your friends. Give us names so that we might feed on all who defy us, and you will be eaten the last. Tristan knew better than to believe in the promise. His father had died teaching him that lesson.

“Careful now,” the man said, tone cold. “Know when you’re beaten, boy.”

Tristan Abrascal smiled. Fortuna smiled back, a goddess adorned in gold and blood, her teeth pale as ivory and sharp as knives.

“I do,” he replied, and borrowed luck.

The ticking in the back of his head began, like the moving gears of a clock, but the noise was drowned out by that of a trigger being pulled. The flint came down, but instead of striking the pan and igniting the powder it snapped clean off. Tristan’s luck had been the very finest, for the flintlock to misfire so catastrophically. He’d have to pay for it later. The man cursed and the young thief turned as he rose, blackjack already in hand. The blackcloak took the strike on his chin well, turning with the blow and it was Tristan’s turn to curse. He wasn’t sure he’d win a real fight, he’d been hoping to end it quick. Instead, the ticking in his head still trotting forward at that same steady pace, he was dragged by the man onto the bed.

Entangled in the sheets like a farce of hateful lovers, the two of them wrestled as they tried to keep away the other’s weapon and strike clean – Tristan with his jack, the man with the butt of his pistol. He landed a blow, and a solid one, on the side of the man’s head. The Aztlan was stunned, but not so stunned that he did not smash the pistol into Tristan’s stomach. Gasping, the thief drew back and was unceremoniously kicked in the chest with bruising strength. He tumbled out of the bed even as the man rose, half-getting up from his sprawl only to have the broken pistol thrown in his face. He bit down on shout. And fuck, he could see the man reaching for the pistol still on top of the trunk. Thinking fast, Tristan tossed back the pistol that’d just bruised his chin.

The man’s arm rose to protect his own head, but it hadn’t been the blackcloak Tristan was aiming at: the pistol atop the trunk went tumbling down to the ground, powder and shot spilling all over the floor. Snarling, the Aztlan instead reached for the sheathed sword. The thief panicked, for a moment, because what was a blackjack going to help against a blade?

“The sheets,” Fortuna hissed.

Body moving without hesitation, Tristan snatched the sheets off the bed and threw them at the watchman even as he drew the sword. The stranger hacked blindly at the cotton, ripping into it, but it wasn’t enough. Forcing himself to go forward instead of back as his instincts screamed he should, Tristan’s fingers tightened around his blackjack and he raised his arm. He darted in quick, smashing into the side of the man’s head once more. The blackcloak stumbled, still hacking away with the blade, and Tristan wasn’t quick enough to avoid getting his left arm nicked. Gritting his teeth, he hit again. The man toppled over the trunk, falling back and over it as the thief followed. He hit again and again, the jack impacting the sheet-covered face until it came back red and the man was no longer moving.

Tristan stayed there, kneeling and panting.

“Fuck,” he rasped out.

Ripping away the sheet, he winced at the bruised and bloody mess he’d made of the Aztlan. Had he killed him? A finger under the nose showed the watchman was still breathing, but he’d taken bad hits. There was no telling, and Tristan had read two books on medicine but he was far from a cutter – much less a real doctor. His fingers closed around the handle of his blackjack. Should he?

“You aren’t getting up,” Fortuna noted.

“He saw my face,” Tristan quietly said. “He doesn’t have a name, but he saw my face. If he’s part of the Watch they could come for me.”

He’d never killed someone who couldn’t fight back before. He hesitated. In the back of his mind, the ticking continued. He would have to even those scales soon, he knew, or the price would get worse.

“Mercy is always a gamble,” Fortuna said, tone sympathetic.

Tristan breathed out slowly. The decision was made.

“There’s already been enough of those tonight,” he said, and set down the blackjack on the floor.

Arms tightening, he snapped the man’s neck the way Abuela had taught him it should be done. The death was swift and hopefully painless. Mercy any greater than that should not be asked of rats. Tristan rose, taking back his blackjack, and steadied himself. He avoided looking at the dead man, instead reaching for the cabinet he’d come for. It was as light as he’d felt, and clearly filled at least in part with some vials by the noise it made when moved. The leather straps were easy to slide over his shoulder, so he did and found the weight further eased. Now was not the time to look at what was inside, curious as he was.

Tristan suddenly winced: the ticking in the back of his mind that had never ceased suddenly quickened. Shit, he’d dallied for too long.

Fingers clenched, Tristan warily released the luck he had borrowed. Like bowstring, the power of his pact with Fortuna snapped the opposite way it had been dragged. He had gained luck, and so now he must suffer misfortune. Cautiously the thief cast a look around, trying to gauge where the blow would come from, but for a few heartbeats nothing happened. Then there was a faint clicking sound, as the well-oiled lock that he had picked to enter the room opened again: the door swung open half a foot, just enough for the woman passing by it to glance curiously. She froze, dark eyes going wide as she saw the shape of the corpse on the floor and Tristan standing with his ill-gotten goods.

Well, Tristan faintly thought, that was going to be somewhat difficult to explain. He opened his mouth to speak, but already the woman was running down the hall and shouting. Fuck. It was more than time to get out of here.

“Take the papers too,” Fortuna said.

He goggled at her. How would that help anything?

“It will make things wo-”

“Trust me,” the goddess urged. “Take the papers.”

Cursing under his breath, he brushed aside a quill to snatch up the sheath of papers and crammed them into the pocket of his coat. It would be difficult to run without wrecking whatever lay inside the cabinet, he thought, but with any luck he wouldn’t need to. Back in the hall he heard shouting downstairs, where the woman was naming him a murderer – not undeservedly – and patrons were shouting in dismay. There were roughs in the landlord’s employ down there and going through would see him caught or killed even if it was the quickest path to a door out of the Azulejo. Thankfully, Tristan had not come by the front door and had no intention of leaving that way either.

Hurrying to the last door down the hallway he pushed it open with no resistance, shutting it behind him. It was empty save for the furnishings, identical to the room where he’d killed a man save for one salient difference: the same open window above the table that he’d come in through. He’d had to cut through the hinges of the shutters earlier, but now the way was clear straight to the rope he’d left dangling. He climbed up without hesitation, wood groaning under his weight, and began by pushing through the cabinet. Once it was through, grunting with effort he slid one of the leather straps onto the curved hooks bound to the rope. It dangled a bit outside, he saw, but held.

Tristan could hear people running up the stairs, even through the door, and he hastened through the window himself. Feet first, he wiggled through the opening and felt nothing at all under him for a delicious heartbeat before tightening his grip on the rope and pulling himself close to the wall. It was not so long a fall that he would not survive it, should he drop down into the alley below, but he might just break a leg. That sort of thing tended to make running away harder, he’d heard. He slid the cabinet back onto his back and climbed down, quirking an eyebrow when a glance above found Fortuna leaning through the window with a smile.

“They’ve found the body,” the goddess told him. “And they’re opening all the doors.”

He sighed. If they found the rope, and they likely would, they’d know to pursue in the streets. It was a descent of about twenty feet, far from hard even after being nicked by a blade, and he was done with it before they’d opened the door. He left the rope there – it had not been cheap, but he didn’t have the time to bring it down– and began to make his way through his escape path. The way out was always the first part to plan out, when thieving. There was no point in stealing anything if you got caught with the goods in hand. He moved out at a brisk pace and kept to the alleys, even though the main streets would have been quicker, moving in a vague diagonal towards the east.

Estebra District was the nicest part of the Murk as well as the wealthiest, so here the lamplights were kept glowing on the main streets through the night instead of dimmed or snuffed as they would be in the rest of the Murk. Best to stay out of that, too much risk of someone seeing his face even if the roughs didn’t catch up. It seemed like they would not, after all. At first Tristan heard shouts out in the street, but a quarter hour later there were only the noises of Sacromonte at night reaching his ear: the burn of the lamplights, the quiet talk of the offal men clearing the streets and the occasional sounds of revelry drifting out of some bawdy house.

No one respectable was out at this hour, which had always amused him. Was the firmament any less dark during day than night? It was only the lamps that made a difference, lamps and the notions of men. The thief did not slow his footsteps until he’d reached the eastern border of the Estebra District, near one of the gates that would lead him into Araturo. There a lone man carrying a nice cabinet might find himself preyed upon, should he not be careful, so Tristan found an empty alley whose mouth was near a lamplight and settled in the shadows to have a look at what he’d taken. It had better be worth it, he thought, for Abuela’s test had seen him kill a man.

He would not blame her for a deed done by his hand, but she had hidden things from him. If he’d known there was a watchman involved… Too late for regrets now, he reminded himself. Fortuna was seated atop what looked like a pile of iron scraps, her red dress somehow artfully draped as if it were a throne, and it was with eagerness she looked at the cabinet when he set it down.

“Treasures, do you think?” the goddess asked.

“I heard vials within,” Tristan murmured back.

“There are elixirs worth as much as diamonds,” Fortuna insisted.

That was true enough, but Tristan doubted any of them were to be found in hostels of the Estebra Districts guarded by a single man. The cabinet of slick dark wood was kept closed by copper latches that popped open after he exerted some strength, revealing an elaborate interior. There were twenty-three small drawers, each marked with a carved symbol, that filled the four sides of the box. The middle of it was hollow, pincers of brass holding small vials containing liquids in shades of grey and green.

“A medicine box?” Fortuna said, sounding skeptical.

The symbols were familiar, Tristan thought. He opened the drawer at the top left and his brow rose when he found within a neatly wrapped bundle of small dark leaves. Perfectly oval, none larger than the tip of a finger. Black verity, he realized, and very carefully wrapped it back without his fingers touching any of the leaves.

“A poison cabinet,” Tristan replied, frown deepening. “And one I know how to use. It looks much like the one drawn in Alvareno’s Dosages.”

Were he a gambling man, and he was, he would wager that the drawers and vials would perfectly match the diagram the book had displayed, including the various herbs and substances suggested by the author. Which went some way in explaining why Abuela had insisted he read and commit the work to memory a few months back, well before she had ever brought up this test, but still left him confused. What use did he have for a poisoner’s kit? He was a thief by trade, not a killer. Tristan’s hands were far from clean but he did not go out of his way to stain them.

“A little more exciting,” Fortuna conceded.

Still frowning, Tristan reached for the papers he’d taken. Perhaps they would shed some light on this. He brought them closer to the light of the street, breathing in sharply when he saw that the very first seemed to be a contract. Had he really killed a watchman out on a job? He kept reading, going through the cramped lines of lettering, and then softly cursed.

“Told you leaving them would be worse, didn’t I?” Fortuna drawled.

“He was employed by the Orelanna brothers,” Tristan hissed. “Everyone knows they’re a front for the Hoja Roja. This is going to get me killed.”

The Hoja Roja were either an association of upstanding landlords and merchants or one of the most successful guild of crooks in the Murk, depending on who you asked. They were also notoriously touchy about honour, and prone to answering slights with grisly executions.

“At least it wasn’t a Watch contract,” Fortuna noted. “So look on the bright side, there’s only the one band of brutal killers after you for this.”

The Aztlan, whose name had been Yaotl Cuatzo, had apparently been bought to kill a god gone feral that’d made a lair in some property near the eastern border of Estebra District. If Yaotl had still been one of the Watch that would have been very illegal, and the Orelanna brothers did not have the reputation of men foolish enough to put their names on illegal contracts. Most likely the man had been a deserter or a washout and the brothers had bought his services intending to pretend they’d not known should trouble come of it. Tristan wouldn’t get the Watch for him after this, which was weight off his back, but that was cold comfort when the Roja was a death sentence on its own.

“I can’t pawn this,” Tristan sighed, looking at the box. “They’ll know it went missing and ask around with the fences.”

The thief liked some of the men and women who bought the goods he stole, but he would have been a fool to trust any of them.

“You could keep it,” Fortuna said.

She liked to hoard things, that goddess of his, regardless of the wisdom of keeping them. It was said to be common in destitute gods like her.

“Sooner or later it would be found,” Tristan murmured.

He had no home, only hiding places, and those were only his so long as no one cared to take them from him. Hardly safe. Was abandoning the cabinet the only path left to him? He balked at that, considering he’d killed a man for it. Besides, it might not even be enough. The Roja would ask around the Murk for who had been planning jobs in Estebra, he thought, and he’d not thought to hide that much from the people he bought his supplies through. Perhaps if he stole again tonight to cover it up? He grimaced. Tristan was tired, needed to get that nick looked at and he had not cased anywhere properly. It would be risky. And there was a chance they would find him anyway. When they did… He bit his lip. Something was wrong. Abuela’s tests could be harsh, but they were never pointless or cruel.

There must be more to this than he had seen. He kept looking through the papers, finding only some personal correspondence and an order lodged with a local butcher for a large quantity of meat. The very last page, though, was in a different handwriting. One he recognized.

Tristan, my dear child,

They will hunt you. I sent you knowing this and knowing you would see my actions as a betrayal.

There is a ship named the Bluebell, at the Fishmonger’s Quay, and before it will stand a man holding a list of names. Yours is one of them.

That is your only way out. Cross the Dominion of Lost Things, survive the trials, and you will be beyond the reach of any in the City.

I will await you at the end of the isle,

Abuela

His fingers clenched. His breath shuddered. None of it had been an accident. If he’d not killed the Aztlan then Tristan would have made an enemy instead, and the threat would perhaps have been even worse. There had been no ending, when he entered that room, that led him back home. Fortuna stood at his shoulder, though he had never heard her rise. She’d not bothered with the pretence.

“The Dominion of Lost Things,” the goddess read. “What is that?”

“An island,” Tristan replied. “Proving grounds for the arrogant and the desperate.”

The Lady of Long Odds watched him with an excited grin, leaning against his side.

“So we’re going?”

In a burning house, a burning life, the only way out was through.

“One more gamble,” Tristan Abrascal quietly agreed.

# Chapter 2

Angharad dropped to the ground as the shot sounded.

The stranger who’d stood in front of her was not so quick and his face exploded in a shower of gore – Sleeping God, she thought, sickened – as she reached for the long saber at her hip. There were a few screams at the grisly sight, but already the people of the street market were scurrying away into alleys. Angharad grit her teeth. This place was not like her home, like Peredur: there was no honour in Sacromonte, this horrid city of filth and rats. No one would help.

Slowly, so that the sound would not give her away, Angharad unsheathed her saber as she crawled towards the edge of the stall that was her sole cover. She should look now, before her would-be assassin could reload their musket, but Angharad instead kept staring at the corpse of the man she had come here to meet. She found herself avoiding the sight of the gaping red wound made by the ball, gaze shying away, and lingering on the dark skin so much like her own.

The stranger had been Malani, by his accent, not Pereduri like her. Not that the rest of Vesper ever thought of the Duchy of Peredur as anything but a petty province of the Kingdom of Malan – her thoughts were straying, she chided herself. Fear had a way of doing that to her. Angharad mastered herself, breathing in and out slowly the way she had been taught. This was no display duel, no tournament of skill where the violence would end when blood or surrender ensued, but she had learned to kill her fear there and she would kill it today as well.

Her breathing calmed, her hand steady around the grip of her saber, Angharad popped her head out to look and-

(The musket ball went through her skull.)

-and she kept rolling, a shot whizzing above her as a lightning-quick bite of pain tore at her shoulder through the dyed cloth of her jacket. She was bleeding, but she rolled all the way behind another stall even as she heard a man curse in Antigua. Angharad’s lips tightened as she felt disapproval waft out of that deep place within her. The Fisher had drawn on their pact when she had failed to, granting her that glimpse of what lay ahead, but the old spirit approved of neither fear nor recklessness. He would not twice extend his hand this way.

“Come out,” a man’s voice called out from her right. “If you do, I’ll make it quick. Won’t be that kind if you make it hard, girl.”

Angharad ground her teeth. She was a peer of Peredur, even if her title had been struck down, and the last of the House Tredegar. Did the man expect she would simply roll over and die when he asked? She drew on her pact, feeling as if she had touched cold water with the bottom of her feet. In her mind’s eye she saw herself rise, but to her surprise the shot that took her in the chest did not come from the right but the left. There were two assassins, not one, she realized as she released the pact. Both of them with muskets. She hesitated. The odds were uncomfortably steep against her. Attack, her mother had taught her. Defence is delay.

Angharad’s fingers stumbled across a metal goblet, a cheaply made thing of iron, as she groped along the ground. It must have fallen when the peddler owning this stall fled. Closing her eyes, she tossed it to her right. Before it could hit the floor, she drew on her pact again and glimpsed the muzzle of the muskets following the sound. Without hesitation she rose, glimpsing two silhouettes in the dim lamplight aiming their guns at her bait. Shadows filtered through the banners and poles of the street market, hiding her for most of a heartbeat as she began to run. A click, a snap, a shot: a ball went whizzing past her as she ducked under another stall. She drew on the pact again, eyes turned unseeing as she moved, and coldly smiled. It was the nearest assassin that had shot, as she had hoped.

Angharad released the power, leaping over a clutter of pottery and keeping the killer now reloading her long musket between her and the assassin still ready to fire. The man of the pair shouted for his accomplice to move, but he was too late. Angharad kicked a stall of colourful ribbons into the woman’s knees and she rocked back with a shout of pain, dropping the ramrod she’d been using to reload. Angharad met her eyes, grey to brown, and saw the fear there. She did not relish it, did not allow herself to, and swung her saber in a clean stroke.

It ripped through the assassin’s throat.

Angharad drew on her pact, the Fisher’s quiet approval easing the coming of the glimpse. Smoothly the noblewoman caught the shoulder of the dying assassin before she could fall, keeping her body in the path of the panicked shot that followed from the other assassin. It didn’t pierce through, having hit the middle of the back, and Angharad let the body drop as she leapt over the stall before her. The man was a tall and thin Lierganen and his fear spread across his face like ink soiling water. He did not lose his wits, though and kicked the last stall between them towards her. It toppled piles of dyed cloth, but Angharad had been quicker and she was already leaping over it.

Her landing was off and she wasted a moment steadying her footing, long enough for the man to strike at her with the butt of the musket. Right into her shoulder, she swallowed a groan. That would bruise. She struck his chin in return, the guard of her saber crunching bone satisfyingly as the side of her blade bit into flesh, and with a hiss of pain the assassin dropped his musket. In his eyes Angharad saw the knowledge of his own death as the gun clattered on the floor, but she did not strike. Could not. The edge of her blade rested against the side of his neck.

“Pick up your weapon,” Angharad ordered, her Antigua crisp.

The man went still, eyes flicking to the blade and then back to her. The fear drained, replaced by a smirk.

“It’s true, then, about you Malani nobles,” he said. “All about honour. Won’t strike an unarmed man.”

Angharad did not answer, simply withdrawing her blade and taking half a step back.

“Fucking fools you are,” the man mocked. “Worse than an infanzon. I’ll just leave, and what are you going to-”

The point went through his eye and into his skull, Angharad snapping her wrist to withdraw the blade cleanly. There was some debate among scholars whether a ‘fair chance’ to take up one’s weapon should be considered three or five breaths, so she had waited a full five. She did not like to walk too close to the line in matters of honour.

“I am not Malani,” she coldly informed the corpse as it toppled.

She was of Peredur, and the people of the High Isle had their own ways. She knelt to wipe the blade on his tunic before sheathing it, idly going through his pockets. A few copper coins, powder and shot. She took the coin, as she would need them for the corpse price and it had been won cleanly by blade. The other assassin bore even less coin and a small dagger. The noblewoman returned to the cooling body of the man who had died trying to pass a message to her, the forever nameless Malani, and set the copper coins above his heart in a circle. It was an old custom: the coin was for anyone to take who would be willing to see the body properly burned or buried.

Feeling dirtied for putting her fingers to a corpse she had not made, Angharad forced herself to look through the dead man’s pockets for a message. To her relief, a pocket within his blood-splattered coat contained a folded letter. It was from Uncle Osian, there was no mistaking it: the small red seal keeping the letter closed displayed the two-tailed snake of House Tredegar. Osian, her mother’s youngest brother, had been allowed by her to keep using the family arms even though he had gone into exile to join the Watch. Though they were estranged, Mother had always said it was more by reason of distance than bitterness.

That distance was now why her uncle was the sole surviving member of Angharad’s family, for the Sleeping God moved in mysterious ways. She took the letter, not yet breaking the seal, and tucked it away beneath her coat. She looked around warily, still alone for now. The city guard might be hopelessly – and infamously – corrupt, but even they would not simply ignore killing in the streets of Sacromonte. Best be gone by the time they arrived.

Angharad took to the streets, going back the way she had come. Cortolo District was a maze of slender canals and curved bridges, its stone facades painted in shades of red and yellow that looked vivid in the warm light of the great pillars of palestone. Those relics had been laid down every few blocks back in the days of the Second Empire and she had found them a wondrous sight at first, for her homeland had nothing like them. Only the Lierganen at their height had been able to afford the luxury of letting stone pillars soak in the Glare for decades. She had since shed the wonder: the warm glow of the pillars had weakened over the centuries, and now there were always shadows between their reach.

The glories of the Second Empire were long gone, broken by great wars with the devils of Pandemonium and the even more brutal wars between the powers that had emerged to claim primacy after the fall of Liergan. Another century, Angharad thought as she passed through a grove of orange trees, and the Glare in those pillars would fade entirely. Sacromonte was far fallen from the peerless jewel of the Trebian Sea it had once claimed to be, and it fell a little further every year. The young noblewoman ignored the few street merchants who called out to her as she found the street she had been looking for, recognizing the painted eyes in red and blue on the side of a baker’s shop.

It made her uncomfortable that people – commoners – would call out to her in such a way. And there were so many of them… Angharad had visited many cities in Malan, when she duelled still, but not even the capital of the kingdom was so thick with people as Sacromonte. It made her feel cramped, somehow. The inn she was staying at was one her uncle had directed her to by letter, a small but clean establishment where she was assured of the hostess’ discretion. The middle-aged matron, a stout woman by the name of Luna, welcomed her with a smile as she passed the green-painted threshold.

“Lady Maraire,” the hostess said. “You’ve returned early. Will you be in want of a meal, then?”

Angharad’s answering smile was stiff. It was not a lie, the name she had given. No peer of Peredur could be recognized in the rolls of the kingdom’s nobility without first taking a Malani name, her own being Anwar Maraire. It had been the compromise honour allowed her between the secrecy Uncle Osian had urged her to and the dishonour inherent in deceiving one whose roof you stayed under. It sat ill with Angharad, for all that she knew it was necessary, and Luna’s graceful manners in referring to her by the name and title were as a twist of the knife every time.

“I do not yet know,” Angharad replied. “I have correspondence to attend to before I can give you answer. Is the solar vacant?”

“It is, my lady,” Luna nodded. “And I tidied it up this morning too. Enter as you please.”

Angharad thanked her hostess and went up the stairs. She slipped into her room, long enough to shed her jacket and grimace at the red staining her pale shirt. The ball had nicked the back of her shoulder, deep enough to bleed her if not to touch muscle. Mother had shown her how to dress a wound when she’d been a girl and still dreamed of her following in her footsteps as a sea captain, so she clumsily cleaned the wound and wrapped a bandage from her trunk around her shoulder. The dark-skinned noblewoman still had two clean shirts and she wasted no time putting one on, but that’d been her last jacket. There was nothing left now but a formal dress and an overcoat, the latter of which she decided on.

The trunk was half-empty, she saw with a pang. She’d been able to bring precious little with her when she had fled Malan, only what friends of the family had been able to salvage from the townhouse in Indawen before it too was seized. Clothes, coin, a few of her father’s jewels and a handful of books. There were fewer of the last than she’d begun with, as she’d had to sell a few for local coinage after docking in the Sanguine Port. Angharad was not so callow as to be unaware that showing she had gold and jewels in a port could get her robbed or worse. She still had all three of Yibanathi’s books of poems, at least, her very favourites in all the world.

The first of them had been a gift from her very first love. Arianwen had been as exacting an opponent on the duelling field as she had been a companion off it, something that had first drawn but ultimately chased away Angharad. Still, the hard words of their parting had since lost their sting and it was now with mostly fondness that the noblewoman ran a finger across the spine of the book. It would have been easy to lose herself in reminiscence, Angharad knew. Easy and dangerous. If she lived in the past, she would be buried with it. She closed the trunk, her haste making the sound harsh, and crisply took her letter before leaving the room.

Down the hall, past the three other bedroom doors of the inn, she found the small solar’s door open and the shutters on its window pulled back. She closed the door behind her, though there was sadly no lock. The chair and writing desk by the window were worn but comfortable and well-tended to, much like the rest of the inn, and Angharad unclasped the sheath at her belt before seating herself. She sighed, leaning back as the scent of lemons and oranges drifted through the window on a subtle breeze. After a long moment, readied, she broke the seal on the letter and opened it.

The looping and elegant calligraphy of her Uncle Osian filled a few paragraphs. Like on every other instance, the older man failed to properly greet her as the Lady of Llanw Hall. Angharad’s fingers tightened, her teeth grit as for a moment she smelled ash on the wind and heard screams in the distance. It took a long moment for her to calm, for her breathing to even out. Her home was gone, her family was gone, everything and everyone she had ever known. And now even here, in this shitheap of a city halfway across Vesper, assassins still hunted her. The rage was familiar by now, a comforting burn, and she embraced it.

Angharad Tredegar would have revenge on the man who had destroyed her family one day. She had sworn it, on that calamitous night where she had lost everything, and the Fisher had heard her oath. The old spirit would see it through at her side, their contract a bond only death could sunder.

Calmed anew, Angharad resumed reading. It was not long before she winced. She had hoped her uncle might come to her here in Sacromonte, but it was not to be: Osian wrote that he had not been allowed to take leave from his work, as it had reached a critical juncture and he was the head of the endeavour. As always, her uncle remained vague on what exactly it was he did for the Watch. He was captain in rank, but Angharad knew that he was not part of one of the many free companies out in the field on contracts.

Her uncle was not much of a fighting man, her mother had always said, but he’d always been clever with his mind and his hands. He’d written of spending much time in the Rookery once, one of the great fortress-islands of the Watch, so Angharad had come to suspect he might be a member of one of the seven Circles – one of the scholarly societies, probably. That meant influence among their ranks, from what little she knew of the workings of the Watch, as though all watchmen were counted as members of the order less than a tenth of them were ever inducted into one of the Circles.

Uncle Osian tersely apologized for being unable to come himself but wrote he had meanwhile made arrangements on her behalf and learned of her enemy.

You were followed from Malan, niece, he wrote. Your ship was asked for by name at the Sanguine Port and silver flowed freely for men who had answers about where you had gone. I fear that the enemy pursuing you is no mere peer or izinduna but instead a high noble, perhaps even a member of the High Queen’s court. I am told by my acquaintances that the Guardia was not simply bought; its officers were ordered by one of the great families of Sacromonte to kill you. Avoid the redcloaks at all costs.

Angharad’s lips thinned. It was worse than she had thought, then, and she had not thought it good in the slightest. She had her own suspicions as to the rank of the man who had ordered the end of House Tredegar, and though they were still only suspicions to have it confirmed her enemy was wealthy and powerful only served to strengthen them. If the city guard itself was hunting her, she thought, then she must leave Sacromonte before long. It would be her death otherwise. Hopefully, then, her uncle had not simply written to tell her he was leaving her to her fate.

She carefully read the rest, eyes narrowing when he cautioned her that he could not intervene too blatantly as her situation was a ‘Malani matter’ and the Watch was not meant to intervene in the affairs of nations without invitation. That might be true in principle, she thought, but hardly in practice. Yet her uncle might not have the influence to force such a matter, and if her foe was influential enough Osian’s allies and superiors might not be willing to intervene on his behalf. It was dire news, but she took it as calmly as she could. Angharad had known it would be a possibility. Yet her uncle, it seemed, was not to abandon her.

After trading favours I have secured an opportunity that could place you beyond the reach of your enemy, no matter how powerful, Uncle Osian wrote. Your name has been added to the list of candidates that are to undertake the yearly trials on the island of Vieja Perdida. It would be a perilous undertaking, I will not pretend otherwise. Fewer than one in five survive. Yet to succeed would make you a fully-fledged member of the Watch immediately, robbing your foe of the ability to frustrate attempts at more traditional enrolment.

It would protect you, Angharad. Even great lords do not dare offend the Watch and your oath need not be a lifelong one. I urge you to take shelter among our order until you are fully grown and ready to face your enemy. There is little more I can do, for I have traded what I have to trade and now find myself short on debts owed. The man who handed you this letter is trustworthy and knows how to have coin made available to you should you need it. If you would send me a letter in answer, he can handle the matter for you.

May the Sleeping God dream you kindly.

Captain Osian Tredegar

Below were scribbled directions to the ship that would take her to the trials should she wish to attempt them, as well as a note that the two days to embark were the seventh and the eighth of the Fourth. Today and tomorrow, Angharad realized with a start. She must have been too slow in finding her uncle’s agent. It was a troubling notion that she might have had a part in the man’s death, and not the sole one that Uncle Osian had brought at her door. He wanted her to join the Watch and she could understand why well enough.

He was right that it would afford her a great deal of protection, and that the oath would not take all of her life: watchmen swore in sevens, and after seven years Angharad expected she would be either dead or ready for revenge. It also meant, however, that she would formally be leaving her title as Lady of Llanw Hall behind. Blackcloaks could not hold titles while they served, and often not even after. She closed her eyes, gritting her teeth.

“It is already behind you, fool girl,” she harshly whispered.

The high courts of Malan had struck her title down before she even fled the kingdom. Her mother had been accused of high treason and her father of corruption – something or other about taxes – so the High Queen of Malan had given her assent to the removal of her family from the rolls of nobility. In the eyes of the law, Angharad was no longer a peer of Peredur. The title she claimed was a meaningless one. And yet the thought of surrendering it felt like hot coals in her belly. She thought of ash and screams again, shivering. It felt like a betrayal to abandon the title when she was the sole survivor of that horror.

Could she really spit on the memory of her parents in this way?

No, she decided. Her situation was not yet so dire that she could not attempt to write her uncle again for another solution. She still had coin enough to last a few months and even if Osian’s agent was dead her uncle could still be contacted through the great offices of the Watch in Sacromonte. Folding the letter and tucking it away in her coat, Angharad opened the drawer on the side of the desk and took both paper and ink. She had a quill of her own, in her trunk, and she rose to fetch it. The door opened and Angharad froze: at the top of the stairs, a man in a red cloak was standing with a pistol in hand.

Another was coming up the stairs behind him, and a moment of perfect stillness followed as Angharad met the guardsman’s eyes. The pact came easy, telling her she was but a moment away from a shot being fired at her.

“Shit,” the red-cloaked man swore, raising his pistol and his voice. “It’s her.”

Angharad shut the door just in time, the ball tearing into it with a spray of wooden shards. Keeping a foot on the door, she hastily snatched up her sheathed saber as another shot thundered against the wood. She could hear men shouting about breaking down the door. They must have thought it was locked instead of simply being held. Going through the corridor would be suicide, she thought, even if there were only two of them. Which she doubted. That left… Angharad glanced at the window, dipping into her pact. She grimaced. She’d get shot. The timing was slightly off. She released the pact and pulled at it again, trying to find the right moment.

The door was about to be knocked down by two men using a bench, she saw. It was now or never.

Angharad, holding her sheathed saber in hand, hurriedly crawled atop the table and pushed her way through the shutters even as the door was smashed down behind her. She fell through and down into the street even as the guard in the street below hastily snapped a shot at her and missed by a wide margin, ball ricocheting inside the solar. She landed on her feet, crouching down with a shout of pain but gritting her teeth as she forced herself to move. She dipped into the pact and coldly smiled at what she saw.

The red-cloaked woman in front of her had a long cudgel in hand, but she dropped it to unsheathe a short sword. It was a mistake. Darting forward before the cudgel hit the pavement, Angharad smashed the pommel of her saber in the woman’s throat and, as she began choking, slipped behind her. The shot that came from the solar window took the guardswoman in the belly. There were screams and shouts inside the inn, red-cloaked guards forcing their way back out to pursue, but Angharad took off at a run. She might not know the city, but a head start was a head start.

She ran until she was out of breath, across bridges and markets, until she was sure she had lost the men and women of the Guardia. Only then did she allowed herself to hide in a shady nook, near a palestone pillar, and belt her sheath properly again. Gritting her teeth, she found herself leaning her forehead against a brightly painted wall. She’d been found. By now the redcloaks would have confiscated the last of her worldly possessions, leaving her with a wealth of three silver arboles in her pockets and the clothes on her back. That, and her saber, was now the sum of what Angharad Tredegar owned.

She would have wept, were she not so angry at them for the unfairness of it all.

But there was, she remembered, one last thing on her. The same letter she had tucked away, the salvation Uncle Osian had offered. With trembling fingers, Angharad took it out and unfolded it. At the bottom of the letter, scribbled, was the name of the ship awaiting at Fishmonger’s Quay. The Bluebell. The young noblewoman breathed out, found her center, and tucked away the letter once more.

“Bury the past,” Angharad murmured, “or be buried with it.”

It was as simple as that. There was no refuge left to her save for audacity, and she would not meet whatever fate awaited her cowed or trembling.

Angharad straightened her back and strode back into the light.

# Chapter 3

The Bluebell was a sturdy old cog, its sail painted the black of the Watch.

Tristan was the first to arrive, which went against him. The sailors on watch were asleep at their posts, napping on crates yet to be loaded, and they’d not been pleased to be woken up. Even less pleased had been their officer, a one-armed crone named Celipa who’d had to be fetched from her bed since she was the one with the roster.

“You look like you’re fresh off the street, rat,” she glared.

“You have the eyes of an eagle, tia,” Tristan flattered. “A rat is what I am, and like one I will disappear quietly into your hold should you let me.”

Her mood was not improved, sadly, and neither was his since Fortuna was now snickering behind him.

“If his name isn’t on the roster, throw him into the sea,” Celipa ordered her men. “I don’t care if you beat him first. Or take his cabinet.”

By the unpleasant smiles on the face of those two well-built sailors, he would be beaten bloody given half a chance. Charming. It was still better than to stay out in the Murk and risk the Hoja Roja catching his tail. They wouldn’t stop at bruises.

“Who are you supposed to be, rat?” the crone asked.

“Tristan Abrascal,” he charmingly smiled.

She was, again, visibly unimpressed. Her lips quirked into a nasty little number as she trailed her finger down the roster, sneaking an expectant glance at him, but then she froze.

“On there, yes?” Tristan pressed.

The old woman looked him up and down, disbelieving.

“Whose brat are you?” Celipa asked. “You must have blood in the black.”

“My blood is buried shallow, tia,” Tristan replied, smiled turned sharp. “May I come aboard or not?”

The crone snorted, but he knew put-on when he saw it. Something had spooked her. 

“Go on, then,” Celipa said. “Down in the hold, you can claim a cot if it’s on the ground.”

“Much obliged,” the thief smiled.

She turned to spit into the waters of the Shoal.

“If I see you try to get into a crate, rat, you’ll get that beating you just ducked,” the crone warned.

It was not the warmest welcome Tristan had ever received, but it was far from the worst. The cog was mostly empty, its crew out in the city, but an armed man pointed him down the two sets of stairs to the hold after eyeing him suspiciously. There were a few sailors sleeping on cots down there, but otherwise it was only a few crates and empty room. Cogs were trading vessels, but this one looked made to ferry men instead. Tristan stepped about quietly, looking for an empty cot with a wall at its back. Fortuna had been pleased with the amusement of watching him get browbeaten earlier, but now that it had passed the goddess was remembering to be offended on his behalf.

“At her age,” Fortuna mused, “it would take only a slip to break her hip.”

“So I can sprain an ankle before taking the trials?” Tristan murmured, careful not to wake a sailor as he shrugged off his cabinet’s leather straps and set it down. “I think not.”

The luck always went hardest after him when it was used to hurt another.

“Every slight should be avenged, no matter how small,” Fortuna said, tone disapproving.

He rolled his eyes at her. Even destitute gods breathed arrogance, never learning the beggar’s virtues. It was in their nature, Tristan had come to suspect, and the nature of gods did not change. Fortuna was the same now as when he’d first met her, nothing more than a terrified boy on the run. The years they’d shared had changed her not a whit.

“I’ll think on it,” he lied.

She huffed.

“Sometimes I think your blood is cold as a lizard’s,” she complained. “Does nothing move you to revenge?”

Tristan smiled without joy, thinking of the five names carved into the marrow of his bones. His List.

“Only the one thing,” he answered. “And it is very far from this boat.”

He cast a look around after, wary of having spoken so long into what others would see thin air. The few sailors down here were still asleep, to his relief. Talking at the unseen was a good way to out yourself as a contractor – or a lunatic, though admittedly some days that line was razor thin. Fortuna sighed, then gestured for him to settle down in the cot. She would, as she’d had for years, keep watch over his sleep. He smiled again, meaning it this time, and slipped under the bedding. Back to the wall and a goddess watching over him, the thief fell straight into slumber.

—

Tristan woke to the sound of a man coughing.

“Company,” Fortuna whispered into his ear.

It could not have been more than a few hours since he fell asleep, early in the morning. Yet the light of a lantern – the cold glow a sure sign the oil was mixed with palestone powder to lend an echo of the Glare’s pale light – was licking at the sides of the hold, held up by a bearded sailor ushering in a ragged band. The one who’d coughed was the first to limp into sight, a toothless old man still clutching his mouth. He was jostled aside by a scowling mass of a man whose leather vest left the arms exposed, revealing intricate patterns of ink. Menor Mano, Tristan recognized, eyeing the tattoos. This one had been a legbreaker.

“Careful,” the sailor warned the big man in a low voice. “Any fighting on the Bluebell will get you shot and thrown overboard. No warnings, no second chances.”

The legbreaker’s scowl deepened and he glared at the sailor.

“Keep walking, blackcloak,” he said.

The sailor snorted, reaching for the pistol at his side.

“You’re one of the paid seats, not the recommended,” he replied. “Mouth off to me again and I’ll put a shot between your eyes.”

The big man’s face contorted in anger, laying bare his broken nose and the flat Aztlan look of his face, but with a snarl he turned away and stalked off.

“Thought so,” the sailor muttered, then turned a cool gaze on the rest. “The same rules apply to you lot. Don’t make me say it again.”

None of those remaining seemed inclined to challenged him. A pair that must be a couple, given how closely they held each other, shied away from the sailor’s gaze as if afraid of being hit while a girl around Tristan’s age looked like she might start crying. It made the two who seemed unconcerned with argument stand out all the more. A bespectacled old woman looking half asleep and past paying attention to much of anything, then to her left a Tianxi of middle age who looked unimpressed. Tristan studied the cast of the man’s shoulders and the way he stood ramrod straight, lips thinning. Soldier.

“Go on, then,” the sailor grunted. “Find somewhere to sleep. The rest will arrive in a few hours.”

They shuffled in tiredly, revealing the last three who’d stood behind. A blond youth with the City’s look about him, looking at his surroundings with polite curiosity, and a pair of short Tianxi twins in their forties. Women both, their dark hair kept in low ponytails with the side of their heads shaved. The cut would have outed them as Meng girls even if their smiles had not revealed blue-tinted teeth. It was a custom of Meng-Xiaofan members to chew strands of dewroot, a sweet-smelling herb said to soothe pains and sharpen wits – at the price of dyeing teeth and sometimes even tongues blue.

As the newcomers settled across the hold, some of them waking disgruntled sailors, one of the twins caught him looking and shot back a quick once-over that led into a snort. She leaned close to her sister for a whisper, the two of them then turning to offer him that Meng grin of porcelain in white and blue. Tristan straightened, muscles tensing as they moved towards him and the blue open robes in Tianxi style they wore over practical City tunic and trousers trailed.

“Pinch me, Ju, I must be dreaming,” the closest twin grinned. “Look at what we’ve got here.”

The other twin looked him up and down, making a show of it.

“Back to the wall, dirty fingernails and a crow’s nest for hair – oh my, Lan,” she snickered. “Smells like rat in here, doesn’t it?”

“She’s not wrong,” Fortuna conceded, ever the traitor.

Yet Tristan’s shoulders loosened, for all that the words were close to insult. It was to be that kind of a conversation; he was back on familiar grounds. Putting on a wicked look, he snorted back. Sniffing the air theatrically, he the gasped in surprise.

“And here I thought it smelled like dust and floating corpses,” he told them. “But I suppose it might just be that foul herb you’ve been chewing.”

There was no need for either side to make the Sign of the Rat, not when the two had the Meng look good as a branded and they’d sized him up in a breath, but it was worth establishing neither were mere mud from the Murk: they were proper gutter, from the wrong side of men’s laws. The tacit admission on his part he knew the main trades of the Meng – drugs and paid deaths – visibly put the sisters in a good mood. Only a fool would talk of trust between rats, but the gutter was a shared tongue. The thief invited them to sit, smile still on his face, and noted the elegant fold of their legs as they did. Sellers, he decided, or someone facing the front. That kind of presentation was learned.

“Tristan,” he introduced himself.

“You have our names,” Ju said.

Not likely the real ones, but he was hardly offended. It was only good sense on their part and he might have tried the same if he’d not had his own written true on the Watch’s passenger list.

“So I do,” Tristan said. “And the pleasure of your company, at an unexpected hour no less.”

He got twin inscrutable looks at the implied question there.

“More interesting is that you were already here, Tristan,” Lan replied. “We were given a precise hour to arrive, see, after coin talked.”

An implied question of her own, with an offered trade tacked on. Given how little he knew of this whole business, the thief had no qualms in trading: it could only be to his advantage. As was only proper between rats, he paid up front.

“A teacher had my name placed on the list,” he told them. “I am uncertain if it is reward or punishment.”

One of the twins – Ju – had a small nick in the skin near her left ear, he noticed. Looked a little deep for a shaving miss, which was interesting, but mostly it would let him tell them apart in a pinch. Both sisters grimaced.

“A hard teacher, if they might think the Dominion of Lost Things a reward,” Ju said. “But also not just anyone, if they could get you on this ship with only their word. We paid for it, see. We need the prize.”

He chewed the inside of his cheek. The ‘prize’ to passing the trials, aside from not dying a horrible death, was to be inducted straight into the ranks of the Watch. They must have had death dogging their shadow, to believe being part of the Meng-Xiaofan would not be enough to assure their safety.

“I have left a burning bridge behind myself,” he carefully admitted. “Unknowingly, I earned the Roja’s ire.”

Lan leaned in, suddenly grinning again.

“Well now, that makes you a friend to these poor sisters,” she said. “No admirers of ours, the Hoja Roja. Not since we were sent to open a shop in the Murk.”

Tristan cocked his head to the side, curious, and lightly traced a finger across his throat. Ju shook her head.

“Merchandise,” she told him. “Dust, whalechew and pipe poppy.”

He let out a low whistle.

“The Roja runs the parlours for those in the Murk,” he said. “I thought the Meng stuck to the docks?”

“Noise was made back in the Republics that we should cut out the middlemen,” Lan said, tone bitter. “We warned against it, told them it was a mistake, but why listen to us? We just live here.”

“Then when the Roja went blood-mad, they cut their losses,” Ju cursed. “The lizard sheds the tail in the tiger’s jaws, they told us.”

It was Tristan’s turn to grimace. Reading between the lines, the Meng-Xiaofan had cut loose the people they’d sent into the Murk as an ill-fated attempt to cut into the Hoja Roja’s trade. Tossed in their heads as appeasement so knives could be sheathed and business return to usual.

“There can’t be many of you left,” he said.

“Two,” Lan replied, tone curt.

And he was looking at them. No wonder they were desperate enough to take the trials as a way out. It was grim talk and he was at a loss as to where to go from there. With grace that only further convinced him they’d had front-facing roles, the twins guided the conversation away from the pit.

“You’d think that for the ramas we paid the accommodations would be nicer, at least,” Ju sighed, looking around.

Tristan hid his surprise. A gold rama was worth three silver arboles, each of which were worth thirty-four copper radizes: he’d only rarely had truck with arboles, much less their golden sisters. And so he sniffed a detail of interest, for though he could believe sisters that’d been in the Meng could scrape together ramas the twins were not the only one who’d come tonight. The thief’s gaze moved to the remainder of the ten that’d been guided in, skimming over the legbreaker and the woman with spectacles, lingering instead on the toothless old man, the shivering girl and the couple. The latter’s clothing was threadbare, shabby. All were thin. Tristan doubted they could scrape a silver together between the lot of them.

“There are other ways to get in,” he deduced.

Lan followed his gaze to the old man and she chuckled.

“That one you have wrong,” she said. “We saw him settle with our own eyes, though he paid in books instead of coin. You’re not wrong about most the rest.”

“They’re paid for,” Ju smiled, mirthless. “It’s for bets, you see. How far they’ll get, how well they’ll do. Large sums by large men.”

Tristan’s hands clenched. An old and familiar anger flared in his belly.

“Palace side?” he asked.

Lan shook her head.

“Gutter,” she said. “The Menor Mano went heavy this year, I hear, but there’s others.”

The anger simmered down. It was not infanzones making sport of gutter lives, only monsters doing as monsters did. The thief hummed, considering the arrivals with fresh eyes.

“So who was I wrong about?” he asked.

Ju cocked a plucked eyebrow.

“Burned a bridge, you said,” she invited.

Fair, Tristan thought. He’d gotten more from them than the other way around.

“Robbed someone out on a contract for the Orelanna brothers,” he said. “It ended in a corpse.”

He saw the shift in the way they sat, the rise in wariness but also the birth of a degree of respect. He’d been a resource, before. Now he was a potential asset.

“That’ll get a man killed, sure enough,” Lan amiably said.

Ju cleared her throat.

“The pretty blond, he’s the other one that paid his way onboard,” she said. “His name’s Brun.”

It took a moment for Tristan’s eye to find the youth in question, as he was tucked away between crates. Back to the wall, with an angle on most the room that let him look in without being seen in return. Not exactly shopkeeper’s habits, these. Brun caught his look, offering a smile in reply. The thief looked away first.

“That one’s dangerous,” Fortuna murmured, leaning against the wall. “And he’s got someone with him. They’re loud.”

Tristan stiffened. Someone, to the Lady of Long Odds, would mean someone like her. Another god. He’d known there would be others with contract on the ship, but it was not a pleasant surprise.

“Someone to be careful of,” the thief warned the twins.

They traded a look, then Ju nodded thanks for the warning. They did not ask why he would give such warning. Asking about someone’s contract was the cat-killing sort of curiosity.

“They let in the desperate at night,” Lan said, “but the rest will be coming soon. The real contenders.”

“The infanzones,” Tristan evenly said. “They have seats promised to them under old accords.”

Even a rat like him knew that, mostly because the infanzones themselves trumpeted it about. The yearly trials on the island were a way for young aristocrats to prove themselves skillful and daring, to jostle with each other for pre-eminence. The names of those who had gone and how far they’d made it were made public, spread around by criers at the Vermilion Festival every year. Rumour had it that making it as far as the third trial could get you bumped up in the line of succession.

“Fifteen,” Ju agreed. “Mind you, noble asses won’t even fill half of those. They bring guards and servants.”

He wrinkled his nose. Another pack to steer clear of.

“They aren’t worth a worry,” Lan dismissed. “Nobles will play it safe, make it to the beginning of the third and then take the way out.”

There were two of those. The trials on the Dominion of Lost Things were meant to forge recruits for the Watch, but your average infanzon had no intention of renouncing titles and wealth to join the blackcloaks. So instead they took the paths of retreat the Watch had arranged on the island, safe places where a participant could desist from going any further.

“It’s the recommended candidates that’ll be dangerous,” Lan continued. “They’re here for the prize and they won’t be afraid to kill to make it.”

Tristan thinly smiled and the older woman looked somewhat abashed. He was, after all, almost certainly one of these recommended candidates.

“I hear most are foreigners, usually,” the thief said, returning the earlier grace.

“Heard that too,” Ju hastily agreed. “Though I’m not sure how many there will be.”

“There’s at most a hundred seats open every year,” Lan noted, “and we heard seventy-three were filled this time. There are two ships, though, and one sailed off yesterday.”

The other twin cocked a brow at him.

“Did you get a look at the passenger list?”

Tristan shook his head.

“But I saw it being read,” he told her, “and it can’t have been too long. Around thirty names.”

The twins hummed. Like him they were curious as to how numerous their batch would be. The conversation drifted after that, staying friendly but of light nature. Neither side had more they were interested in trading, and it was too early in the venture to begin talking of the kind of alliances that would mean life or death when bodies began dropping. The twins took their leave before long, going around the hold to gladhand the others – the couple in particular, he noted. He ought to do the same, feel out the others for enmities and alliances. The large bruiser was asleep and not the kind of man he’d want to work with besides, so he had a frank look at the others.

The two greyhairs were out of the running for now. The toothless old man was still coughing, looking half a step into the grave, and though the old woman seemed spry she bore spectacles. Should those be broken, she might well be half blind. Disinclined to work the couple when the twins were already at it, Tristan considered the last three. ‘Brun’ was to be avoided, Fortuna’s warning heeded, which left the girl shivering in a corner and the Tianxi with a soldier’s bearing. The girl first, he decided. Her curly brown hair trembled with the rest of her when he sat down close, offering a smile that she visibly forced herself to return. She flinched when he rested his back against the wall. With that pointed chin and those wet eyes, she looked like a terrified bird.

“Tristan,” he introduced himself.

“Marzela,” she replied.

The thief had held little truck with sympathy – either given or received – since burying his mother, but he knew how to feign the appearance of it well enough.

“Rough night?” he gently asked.

The girl had a full-body shiver, swallowing loudly.

“I shouldn’t be here,” she burst out, unable to help herself. “It’s not even my debt, but they said…”

“You were forced to come,” Tristan said.

Marzela nodded, eyes shining with tears.

“I haven’t seen either of my parents in years, but the moneylenders said it didn’t matter,” she whispered. “The law says it’s my debt too.”

“Did you try to flee?” he asked, eyes studying her closely.

Now that he was closer to the girl, he could tell there was something… off. More than just fear. She kept flinching without obvious reasons for it, like she could hear or see something he could not.

“They had pistols,” Marzela replied.

You’d have had a better chance with bullets than the trials, Tristan thought. You should have run. Her hands were trembling still, one rubbing her forearm as if to calm herself, and that was what let him put it together. She wasn’t just rubbing but tracing a pattern with a finger. Something complex, a symbol of some kind with intricate lines. Again and again she traced it, never noticing even as she told him that she’d been promised the debt would be written off if she survived the first trial. Tristan smiled and nodded at all the right places, mind spinning. Marzela had a compulsion, a tic. One of the most obvious signs someone had just come into a contract and their god had strong hold on them.

The thief ought to know, it’d taken years for him to unlearn the habit of flipping a coin that did not exist.

“It’ll be all right,” Tristan comfortingly lied. “We will be many on the island. With arms and numbers there will be some safety.”

Marzela twitched again, beginning to look at the ceiling before she stopped herself. A contract that enhanced her senses, perhaps? Whatever it was, she seemed to be drawing on it at all times and that was dangerous. First to herself, but in time perhaps to others as well. The thief suggested she try to sleep before rising back to his feet, but neither of them much believed in her promise to try. Tristan then moved towards the soldier, who’d settled against a crate and was pulling at a copper flask. The smell of liquor – cheap and strong – wafted up as soon as he approached, the Tianxi offering up a sardonic smile.

“My turn, is it?” the man said. “At least you’re not quite as obvious about it as the twins.”

Tristan sat down slowly, as to be sure he would not be provoking a man he now saw was armed. The sword sheath across the Tianxi’s lap was empty, but there was the bulge of a pistol tucked under his coat. And my life for a sparrow’s that he’s got more knives than I do tucked away.

“We’ll be sailing out soon,” Tristan replied, caught out but unrepentant. “Before we do I would know the lay of the land.”

“Practical of you,” the man said, not offended in the slightest. “What’s your name, boy?”

“Tristan.”

“Yong,” the other said, offering a nod of a greeting.

Tristan returned it, wary of this stranger who was putting away rotgut like water but whose eyes were still sharp.

“You’ve nothing to worry of me, Tristan,” Yong plainly said. “I was not sent here to play red games.”

The thief’s eyes narrowed. A lie, at least in part, for the twins had told him of those who’d paid their way onto the ship and Yong had not been one of them. Deciding that the man’s easy temperament allowed for a gamble, he decided to press.

“Yet someone sent you,” Tristan said. “Your seat was bought by another.”

The Tianxi grimaced.

“Those two tell you that, did they?” he said, jerking his chin towards the twins. “You’d best be careful not to trust them too much.”

Tristan trusted no one at all, save perhaps Fortuna, but saw no need to tell the man as much.

“And why’s that?”

Yong lowered his voice.

“Do you know why they’re talking to the couple so much?” he asked.

Tristan shook his head.

“The husband, Felis, he’s got scales on the arm and he’s been…”

Yong trailed off, mimicking scratching his arm, and the thief could not entirely hide his revulsion. Skin flakes that looked like scales and incessant scratching were symptoms he was familiar with, as would be any child of the Murk’s: the man was a dust addict. The twins would not have missed that, not with dust being one of the merchandises the Meng-Xiaofan pushed. If he goes into withdrawal and they have dust on them, they good as own him, Tristan thought.

“There’s no clean shoes in the Murk,” the thief finally said, quoting half an old saying.

Shit clings to all our soles, the other half went. It was not absolution or forgiveness, but blame was like misery: one of those rare things there always seemed to be enough of to go around. Best to be careful with it, and with the Tianxi as well. It was why he’d phrased his answer to have a hanging question.

“All I need is to get to the third trial,” Yong bluntly said. “I’ve no interest in anything else.”

“Not even a black cloak?” Tristan casually asked.

Too casually, he realized with a silent curse as Yong’s eyes narrowed.

“Might put one on if it’s offered,” the man said. “You?”

Honesty or vagueness? Honesty, he finally decided. Their interests were not at odds and it was always best to stay on the good side of men with pistols and knowledge of how to use them.

“I don’t have a choice,” the thief admitted. “I’m in it to the end.”

“Seems like we might have a thing or two in common,” Yong casually said.

The offer hung in the air. It was too early to commit to alliances, Tristan knew, and yet did not decline. What were the odds he’d get a better offer? He was a rat, not the kind of sought-after soul that would be able to pick out their companions when the real recommended arrived. He wants something, the younger man decided. I’m fit and I look like I might be able to handle myself in a fight, but he might get better if he holds out until the others begin to arrive. Which meant Yong wanted something that a rat was in the best position to give. Far from unsettling him, Tristan found the thought a reassuring one. An ally without a use was just fodder. The suspicion that he wouldn’t just be a body to throw in harm’s way settled his doubts.

“It seems like we do,” the thief agreed.

The Tianxi smiled.

“Good,” he said. “Then I have a suggestion to make.”

Tristan’s brow cocked. So now came the price.

“I obtained the name of a sailor on this ship who likes gifts,” Yong said.

Someone that could bribed. Always useful.

“And what would be gotten, for that gift?” Tristan asked.

“To sit in a corner as the rest of the travellers board,” the Tianxi said. “Being given names and stories by our friend.”

For a heartbeat, Tristan wondered how he was being had. He was being sent to learn information that might well save his life, so why would Yong ever allow someone else to learn it in his stead? It made no sense, unless… He’s a bought seat, Tristan realized. They won’t let him out of the hold even for a bribe. But I’ve got a recommendation, so they just might. It wasn’t a rat that Yong had been after but someone who the blackcloaks wouldn’t confine to the bottom of the boat.

“I like him,” Fortuna decided. “He’s clever.”

Yong pulled at his copper flask again, the stench of liquor spreading. He’s also likely a drunk, Tristan thought, not that the goddess would consider that a black mark on anyone’s record. But a drunk was something he could work with, so he would.

“Let’s get our friend that gift, then,” the thief smiled, and the soldier smiled back.

—

Lucia looked rather straight-laced, for a woman taking bribes. Her face was stern in that way that people became stern when they were uncomfortable and looking to take it out on someone else.

“You’re going to be peeling potatoes,” the sailor told him. “So sit on the bench and shut up.”

As Lucia easily had a stone on him in muscles and belly fat while Tristan had a fondness for avoiding arguments with people who’d be able to snap his neck, he dutifully sat on the bench and shut up. The sailor passed him a peeling knife and dropped a misshapen potato onto his lap, grunting in satisfaction when he began to deftly peel away. He was three in – a pittance, compared to the barrel of hundreds they were working through – when she finally deigned to address him.

“They’ll be coming in two batches,” Lucia said. “The foreigners first, most at once, and then the noble brats.”

Though she was still glaring at him like he’d emptied her pockets instead of the very opposite, Tristan’s fondness for the sailor could not help but mount. Anyone who held the infanzones in such open contempt could not be entirely bad. He’d caught her wording, though, and a question made it to the tip of his tongue. There it lingered, long enough the woman noticed.

“Out with it,” she grunted.

“You said foreigners,” he said. “Not recommended.”

She nodded, looking approving for the first time since they’d met.

“Most years we only take in foreigners that got recommended,” Lucia agreed, “but this one’s different. Some seats were handed out for companies to sell.”

Tristan brow furrowed.

“Why?”

“The better question, boy,” the sailor replied, whittling away at the potato skin, “is why you’re on this ship when last month one full of recommended from Sacromonte sailed straight for the Rookery.”

His brow furrowed even deeper. The Rookery was the common name for the great island-fortress that was the seat of the Watch, said to be as a city of blackcloaks. Watchmen were trained there in a great war camp.

“I’m the only one from the city to take the trials,” Tristan slowly said.

“That’s got a recommendation, anyway,” Lucia shrugged.

He rocked back in surprise. What was Abuela up to? The more he learned the more obscure her motives became. His companion lost interest in the conversation, and with a curt gesture told him to start peeling again. They stayed on the deck for an hour, working away until the others began to arrive. The bulk of the first wave arrived as a group, escorted by a pair of blackcloaks. Tristan watched them carefully from his corner of the deck. Lucia, for all that she seemed to enjoy none of this, delivered on her promises without qualms.

“See the Aztlans?”

Tristan nodded, eyes moving to the only two among the pack whose skin was the light brown common to those from the Kingdom of Izcalli. A woman in her twenties and a boy that couldn’t be older than Tristan himself, eighteen. The boy had pale eyes, but what drew attention to him was how eerily perfect he looked. Every part of his body symmetrical and proportioned, like he’d been sculpted instead of born. It made his skin crawl to look at.

“Don’t know much about the girl, but the boy’s called Tupoc Xical,” Lucia said. “Recommended, he’s some sort of prodigy trained by the Leopard Society. He’s got a contract too.”

Not a likely ally then. Izcalli’s societies were bloodthirsty bastards one and all, always waging their famous flower wars.

“The two Ramayans got recommended because they have family in the black,” the sailor continued, pointing at a pair of youths.

Of the many peoples of the Imperial Someshwar, the Ramayans were those Tristan knew best: they held the great cities on the empire’s south eastern coast, so their trading ships sometimes came as far as Sacromonte. He’d never seen any dressed so colourful as these two, though. The girl of the pair had no less than three pistols at her hips, making her a rather more impressive sight than the chubby-cheeked boy looking like he was about to keel over.

“Then you’ve got the three from our corner of the Trebian Sea,” Lucia grunted.

A girl with unfortunate acne wore the jacket and cravat typical of the Asphodel Rectorate, one of Sacromonte’s closest neighbours, and a Raseni veiled from head to toe in grey was carefully staying away from her. Not unexpected, given that Rasen and Asphodel were said to war with each other incessantly. The last was a tall and thin man with heavy circles around his eyes.

“The man’s from Asphodel too,” Lucia quietly said. “Leander Galatas, a former sailor. Be careful of him.”

Tristan cocked his head to the side, eyes questioning.

“His recommendation came from the Navigator’s Guild,” she said. “Odds are he knows some Signs.”

The thief’s belly clenched. Learned men insisted that the Signs were not truly magic, merely a way for the initiated to manipulate the Gloam, but Tristan had heard stories. Winds called from nowhere, men set alight with but a word. And of those who used the stranger arts going mad, hollowing from the inside as the Gloam devoured them. He silently nodded. The first arrivals disappeared into the belly of the ship but Tristan stayed, waiting as the last four of the foreigners trickled in over the following hour. First a pack of three dark-skinned Malani, a younger pair whose air and clothes screamed ‘money’ with a scarred older woman behind them that had a fighter’s look. A guard, he figured.

“The younger two were recommended,” Lucia said. “I heard there’s a Malani swordmistress coming, but it shouldn’t be one of them.”

The last to arrive was Tianxi, a girl his age with a sword at her hip and a musket slung over her back. Her eyes were a startling silver shade.

“She was recommended by the Rookery,” the sailor provided. “And she’s got a contract for sure.”

The stranger’s eyes swept over the deck, neither hurried nor slow, and for a moment Tristan would have sworn they lingered above his head. Then she walked on, disappearing below deck. Lucia frowned.

“There’s supposed to be one more,” she said, “but at this rate the infanzones will be getting here first.”

Her prediction came true. But half an hour later, Sacromonte’s noble sons and daughters arrived in a colourful procession. There must have been half a hundred people crowding the docks, some mounted but most brought by carriages that servants in livery promptly began to unload. The two carriages at the front did not bear colours he recognized.

“Villazur and Ruesta,” Lucia told him.

Tristan hummed. He knew of the Ruesta, a family sworn to one of the great houses of Sacromonte – though he could not recall which one. Their wealth was famous. He’d never heard of the Villazur.

“The Ruesta girl’s a bloody idiot,” the sailor growled. “Brought three people with her, and would you believe that two of them are maids.”

“The Villazur?” he asked.

“Better,” Lucia conceded. “Got some Malani huntsman, I hear.”

He was about to ask about the rest when the Villazur servants moved aside, revealing a sight that snatched away his breath. Painted on the sides of the last two carriages was a red tree on blue.

“Cerdan,” Tristan hissed.

Lucia slowly nodded.

“Brothers,” she said, “with a valet and-”

He didn’t hear the rest of the sentence because blood was rushing to his ears. Helping down some noble waste from his carriage was a man that Tristan Abrascal would recognize even if his eyes were plucked out of his head. It’d been years, so the hair was longer and the beard touched with grey, but the burn scar near the ear looked the same. Tristan could still hear the casual drawl, smell gunpowder and blood. Hear his father weep. Cozme Aflor. So that was why Abuela had put him on this ship, sent him into these trials. She was giving him two of the Cerdan and the man whose name was at the bottom of his List.

Fortuna’s hand on his shoulder brought him back to himself.

“-id. Kid.” Lucia said, sounding impatient. “What’s with you?”

“Nothing,” Tristan lied. “Our bargain is done. My thanks.”

The sailor blinked in surprise. He slid the peeling knife into his half-done potato, fingers clenching, and dropped it back into the barrel.

“There’s still one missing,” she said. “We’ll be waiting for her until midday at least.”

“This is enough. One won’t make a difference.”

“Fine,” she grunted. “But you best not come complaining later.”

He shook his head and briskly took his leave, wanting to be in the hold before the nobles arrived. Fortuna walked by his side, red dress trailing on the floor behind her like a river of blood, and Tristan forced his jaw to unclench.

“I was wrong,” he spoke under his breath as he reached the top of the stairs.

“What about?” Fortuna lightly asked.

“There is only one thing that moves me to revenge,” Tristan Abrascal murmured, “but it appears it is not far from this boat after all.”

# Chapter 4

They were waiting for her at Fishmonger’s Quay.

Every street had a pair of redcloaks watching passers-by, forcing any hooded or veiled to show their faces before they were let through. Angharad, keeping to the alleys, saw how they compared the faces to small pieces of parchment. She was only able to get close enough to see it was a drawing, but that told her enough: her hunters knew what she looked like and where she was headed. Worried, Angharad decided on patience. She spent one of her last three silver arboles on a ratty room and a meal at an inn two blocks off the edge of the Quay, figuring she would have a better shot come night.

After the streetlights dimmed and the guardsmen tired she would make a run for the Bluebell. She got directions to the ship at the cost of breaking a second arbol to buy sailors ale with coppers, then settled in to wait. The naps she took on the straw mattress were intermittent, somehow leaving her more tired than when she’d begun, all the more so when she was jolted out of the last by angry shouts. Awake in an instant, she drew her saber and made for the door. Cracking it open just enough to peer through, she saw a gaggle of redcloaks whose officer was loudly arguing with the innkeeper and his pair of toughs.

“-paid up for the month, you don’t get to come in here and hassle my patrons,” the innkeeper was snarling.

 Angharad did not hold out hope: one side had swords and muskets, the other clubs. The argument would last only so long as the Guardia officer let it. She stole a glimpse ahead, saw they would be taken utterly by surprise and steadied her breath before bursting out. Defence is delay. The redcloaks had swords out but not before she got a head start, only two at the back going for their muskets instead. Angharad kicked a table in the closest man’s leg, tripping him as he shouted curse, then ducked low as a shot whizzed past her head. A stolen glimpse told her there was no ambush ahead so she ran out into the night, boots thumping against the pavestones.

The redcloaks followed.

In a city so large as Sacromonte it should have been the easiest thing in the world to lose them, but for all that she could steal away for slices of an hour the enemy always caught up to her. They never seemed to know exactly where she was, but neither were they far off. Contractor, Angharad shivered in realization. They had hired someone whose spirit-given gift could find her. Knowing of it was little help, the hours stretching into a torment of constant running and hiding.  She was exhausted, as much from the flight as the constant drawing on her own contract to avoid ambushes.

The Fisher was not as some other spirits, whose prices were constant: she had sworn a single oath in return for his gift. Yet that did not mean taking glimpses was not tiring, slowly turning her thoughts feverous. It felt as if her brain was swimming in warm water, pressure slowly building behind her eyes. How long could she last? She did not know, but salvation came without warning at morning’s cast. Just as the streetlights returned to their full glare the redcloaks fell behind. No longer was their hunt aimed, instead stumbling about as if she were no longer tracked.

Relief brought tears to her eyes and she crawled into dark alley smelling of trash and human filth to collapse behind a pile of broken planks. What felt like a heartbeat after she woke to the sound of movement, drawing her saber, but before her was no man. It was a red-eyed rat, large as a cat and watching her unblinkingly. Behind it, scrawled on the wall, she saw a bloody mark she had missed in her earlier exhaustion: seven rats whose tails were tied in a knot, itself swallowing up a skull. It was raw work, little more than outlines, but somehow she knew exactly what she was looking at the moment she saw it. Swallowing loudly, Angharad dropped her blade. It clattered loudly against the ground.

“Manifold apologies, honoured elder,” the noble hurriedly said. “I did not mean to disturb your shrine.”

The red-eyed rat watched her still, unmoving. An apology would not be enough. Grimacing, Angharad slowly reached for her abandoned saber and pressed her palm against the edge. It cut shallowly but drew blood, enough she was able to hold out her hand and drip red on the stone before her. After the third thick droplet fell the great rat finally moved, darting forward to lick at the red while Angharad let out a relieved breath. Her offering had been accepted; rare were the spirits that would turn on you immediately after accepting a gift.

In the moment that followed the noble felt her blood cool, as if a cold tide were washing through her veins. The Fisher’s presence filled her. He felt neither angry nor worried, only… expectant. The spirit was watching, and the red-eyed rat stilled for a moment before licking up the last of her blood.

“Good manners,” it praised in a voice that was like a like a thousand chitters threaded into a single, desperate scream.

Angharad struggled to keep her horror off her face, a struggle that she lost when the massive rat suddenly began to retch. It convulsed, as if dying, and spewed out what she thought to be red bile. Only the bile was in the shape of a rat. The Fisher’s approval rose at the sight and his presence withdrew, shivers strumming down her spine in his wake. That moment of distraction was enough for the red-eyed rat to be gone from her sight, leaving only the scrawled mark on the wall and the bloody little abomination at her feet. Sheathing her sword, Angharad rose tiredly and pressed the cut on her palm closed. She would have taken the time to dress it if not for the blood rat beginning to scurry away.

Gritting her teeth, the dark-skinned noble cast aside her hesitation and followed the boon the spirit had granted her.

It stayed always in the corner of her eye, moving so quick that she could not spare so much as a glance at her surroundings as she followed. Weaving through a maze of dirty alleys she ran, slowly coming to realize that she was being led in the direction of Fishmonger’s Quay. The little creature kept away from the glow of lamplights and palestone pillars, its path labyrinthine, but through shadow after shadow Angharad was led to an end. The stink of sewage filled her nostrils, making her gag, and as she had a dry retch she saw the little blood rat glancing at her once before scurrying to the edge of a sewer gate.

There it broke apart, turning into drops of blood that slid into the cloying vileness.

Minding her manners, Angharad offered the sewer gate a shaky bow of thanks before covering her mouth. She carefully stepped to the edge of the alley, eyes squinting at the lamplight’s glow she had somehow grown unused to. Dealing with spirits was never simple as you might wish. For the first few glances she was lost, until she peered further out and saw a pair of bored redcloaks inspecting everyone passing through the street. Only, Angharad saw, she was already past them. Heart beating in relief and excitement, the noble turned to the sewer gate and bowed again.

“I will remember this favour, honoured elder,” she promised.

In the heartbeat that followed a gun was cocked behind her and Angharad Tredegar was duly reminded that dealing with spirits was never simple as you might wish.

“Don’t move,” a woman’s voice harshly ordered in Antigua. “Turn around and show me your-”

If she ran for it-

(The ball tore through her back, a line of burning pain.)

-Angharad threw herself to the side, the shot catching the edge of her coat. In a single smooth spin she unsheathed her saber and faced the redcloak, who judged she would not be able to reload in time and dropped her musket in favour of the straight sword at her hip. The noble timed her breaths with her steps, her body moving with the fluid grace of years of practice. There was no need to steal a glimpse of the future when she could see it writ in the lay of her enemy’s movements. The redcloak’s blade came free, striking out, and Angharad calmly twisted her wrist to deny the blades contact before snapping it back into place. Her back foot pushed her forward in a clean, textbook strike that opened the redcloak’s throat.

The other woman fell down with a wet gurgle, the sound drowned out by the Guardia killers already coming this way. Angharad ran for it, the directions she’d bought last night just enough for her to avoid charging off in the wrong direction. This cursed hovel of a city had no signs, as if Sacromontans expected all to know their way around. The docks were close, only a few blocks away, but the ruckus had seen people empty the streets so Angharad could see the redcloaks running after her. Only a dozen, at first, but more were coming from seemingly every street. She hurried, sweat pouring down her back as she struggled to stay out of musket range – shots kept sounding, keeping the pulse of fear in her belly alive – and finally reached the long stone dock she’d had described to her.

An old cog was waiting at the end of it, its sails painted black like all the Watch’s ships, and Angharad felt her spirit rally. Close, so close now and… The shot came from closer, the window of some warehouse behind, and though she threw herself down in time it was straight into a pile of crates. Mercifully empty, she thought even as her aching shoulder toppled two into the water, but she got tangled in the net keeping them together. Ripping her way free cost her precious time, the pack of baying hounds nipping at her heels reaching the dock.

“Stop her,” a man shouted. “Manes be my witness, if you keep fucking missing her-”

The Bluebell was a mere thirty feet away but the Guardia were so close she could almost feel them breathing down her neck. Half-turning, she saw a man reaching for her arm and twisted away but then there was a shot and… and the redcloaks stopped cold. It’d come from the front of her, Angharad realized belatedly, and there she found a grizzled old woman holding a smoking pistol in her only hand. She’d unloaded in front of the redcloaks, a warning shot.

“Angharad Tredegar?” the old woman called out.

“Yes,” the noble replied, the word half a sob of relief.

“We’ve been waiting for you, girl,” the blackcloak grunted. “Get on the bloody ship, we’re going to miss the tide.”

Angharad took a hesitant step towards the Bluebell, then saw her hesitation reflected on the face of the redcloaks looking at her and was emboldened to take a second. Before she could take a third a Guardia officer pushed his way to the front of the pack, a moustachioed young man whose shoulders were dripping with ornate braids and medals.

“What are you idiots doing?” the man shouted. “Take aim, she’s-”

“She’s under the protection of the Watch, boy,” the old woman interrupted from above. “Turn around before this gets unpleasant.”

Angharad slowly took another step back, trying not to draw anyone’s attention as she was uncomfortably aware that there was no cover at all on the dock: it was all bare stone. There were at least a dozen muskets in the crowd and with that many people aiming at her a glimpse would not be able to save her life.

“Boy?” the young man repeated, turning red. “It’s captain to you, you old bitch, and you best disappear back into your ship before I-”

Angharad took another step back but this time she was noticed and half a dozen muskets were turned on her. Yet in the time that’d passed the blackcloaks had not been idle and now sailors leaned over the side of the ship to aim their own muskets down at the redcloaks. She counted nine, a number that had her stomach clenching. Were there not more sailors on the ship?

“Before you what?” the old woman sneered. “You so much as take a shot at us, boy captain, and it’s a war you’ll have on your hands.”

“A war I’ll win,” the mustachioed man retorted. “I have the numbers to storm your ship if you do not desist.”

He seemed confident, and as Angharad glanced as the still-swelling numbers of redcloaks – more were still coming from the backstreet – she had to admit he was right. Not all of them had firearms, but all were armed and there had to be forty by now. The blackcloak laughed scornfully at the threat.

“And what do you think’ll happen, after?” she asked. “Once word gets to the Rookery that Sacromonte has broken the Iscariot Accords, that you attacked a Watch ship in the discharge of its duties?”

A ripple of unease went through the guardsmen.

“Our orders are absolute,” the officer flatly replied.

“They’ll recall every company from Broken Gates to the Weeping Light, boy,” the one-armed blackcloak said, “to burn this fucking city to the ground. To make an example of Sacromonte.”

She scoffed.

“Only whoever owns you won’t want that war on their head,” the blackcloak said. “So instead what’ll happen is that they’ll send all your heads to the Rookery in a basket as an apology before denting their treasury for reparations.”

Unease turned to dismay, a few guardsmen even taking a step back. The officer’s face was bright red with anger but he had no answer.

“I wonder how the infanzones will like paying up for your mistake,” the old woman added with a nasty little smile.  “Surely they’re forgiving souls? They wouldn’t take it out on your families after you die.”

And that was the shot that sounded the rout. Another officer, older but with only half as many gaudy medals, took the captain aside and spoke in a hushed voice. It was a done deal anyhow, the rank and file already putting away their weapons. Whatever loyalty they had it did not stand stronger than the prospect of having their heads cut off. For all that was she was grateful, Angharad could not help but feel a thread of contempt. True soldiers would not have balked in the face of threats. It was the weakness of Sacromonte that it did not have proper ruling nobles, a weakness that trickled all the way down.

“I’ll remember this,” the captain snarled, tearing away from the other redcloak.

“And we’ll remember you, boy captain,” the blackcloak called back. “You ought to be a lot more worried about that.”

The Guardia cleared out in haste, as if ashamed of being seen driven away, and Angharad at last let out her breath. She’d made it. The old woman called out for her to hurry and she raced up the ramp, seeing that hidden behind side of the ship there’d been another dozen sailors. They were putting away muskets and orbs of metal bearing fuses that Angharad recognized as zhentianlei, those dreaded Tianxi grenades. No wonder the one-armed woman had not feared the redcloaks: packed tight as they had been on the docks, without cover, it would have been a slaughter. The noble offered said blackcloak a short bow of gratitude.

“My thanks for your protection, my lady,” Angharad said. “I will not forget it.”

“The name’s Celipa, and I’m no lady of any kind,” the old woman snorted. “You owe me nothing, girl. You’ve got blood in the black and you’re kin of Osian’s besides.”

She blinked.

“You know my uncle?”

“We were both part of the hunt for the Hull-Eater,” Celipa told her, then tapped the stump of her missing arm. “After a thrall took a bite he helped set me up on the Bluebell.”

Angharad choked. The Hull-Eater, as in the great spirit whose claws rent ships apart and whose army of crazed thralls had famously turned some ancient fortress into a den of horrors? Its death a few years ago had been widely celebrated back home, but Uncle Osian had never so much as hinted he’d been involved. She could hardly imagine a man her mother had always considered – however fondly – to be useless in a fight anywhere near such a monster. At loss about anything to say, the noble got out something about how her uncle was a dutiful man while Celipa herded her across the deck towards broad stairs descending into the belly of the cog.

“I’ll be two days before we get to the Dominion,” Celipa quietly said. “Use the time to find allies, Tredegar. Loners always die early in the second trial.”

It would have been ungrateful of her to demand that a woman who’d saved her life address her properly as Lady Angharad, so the noble bit down on the sentence before it could leave her lips. Instead she nodded her gratitude at the advice before traversing the lower deck – the kitchen, dormitories for the crew and the arsenal – to make her way to the hold at the bottom. There she found the travellers she would share a journey with, having haphazardly claimed corners and cots. All eyes were on her from the moment she entered, the cost of being the last to arrive, but she kept her back straight. It would not do to show weakness.

A sweeping look at the hold told her there had to be more than twenty people in there, but what drew and kept her eye was the well-dressed quartet being attended to at the back of the hold. Two men and two women. The men’s close looks and identical red and blue cloaks outed them as kin, but the other two were dissimilar: one tall and lean, her short blond hair pulled in a bun while the other was a sultry dark-haired beauty with beautiful green eyes. Nobles, she instantly knew. Infanzones, as Sacromontans called them. The beauty met Angharad’s eyes, smiling sweetly, and then addressed an older girl at her side in servant’s livery.

A few steps later the handmaiden was offering Angharad an elegant curtsy, bowing her head.

“Lady Isabel invites you to introduce yourself, my lady,” the girl said.

Angharad acknowledged her with a polite nod, gathering herself for a moment before approaching her fellow nobles. The men looked bored at her approach, one of them even seeming irritated, but Lady Isabel’s smile was yet sweet and her leaner companion looked curious. As the invited party, Angharad introduced herself first.

“Lady Angharad Tredegar of Llanw Hall,” she said, lightly bowing. “At your service.”

“How genteel,” the green-eyed beauty exclaimed, putting a hand to her heart. “I am Lady Isabel Ruesta, Lady Angharad, but you must call me Isabel.”

“It would be my very great pleasure,” Angharad replied, struggling to keep her gaze off the flattering cut of Lady Isabel’s dress.

Most her lovers had been cut more from the cloth of the other noble lady here than lovely Isabel’s, but Angharad could appreciate beauty in all its forms. Including form-fitting dresses of yellow brocade. As a willful distraction, she turned to the woman by Lady Isabel’s side.

“Lady Ferranda Villazur,” the lean woman introduced herself, tone cool. “A pleasure.”

Angharad returned the courtesy, though she was barely done speaking when one of the men cut in.

“You have the Malani look but the name does not fit,” the noble drawled. “Strange.”

Angharad’s expression grew stiff and the implied accusation of being an impostor.

“That is, Remund, because she is not Malani,” the other man scoffed. “These are Pereduri names.”

He then offered her a bow and a practiced smile. At second look he looked older than the rude one, his face sharper and more refined.

“I am Lord Augusto Cerdan,” he said. “Please forgive my brother’s rudeness, Lady Angharad. He never did learn his courtesies.”

“It is nothing, Lord Augusto,” Angharad briskly replied, her mood soured.

It was soured even further by Lord Remund’s appraising gaze on her.

“Ah, Peredur,” the infanzon said. “I had quite forgot about it. You’re not much paler than the other Malani, though. I expected more of a difference.”

Angharad’s jaw clenched. Peredur was not like the other isles of the Kingdom of Malan. It was nearly impossible to conquer without a great fleet so Angharad’s ancestors, unlike the Malani, had not swept across the island in a storm of iron and flame. They had instead settled the land and allied with the ancient dwellers of Peredur, twined the blood and slowly grown into a single people. And the ancient Pereduri had been men of pale skin, so to this day some ignorant souls expected Angharad’s people to be much paler than the Malani. The polite ones, anyway.

The less polite liked to imply that the ancient Pereduri had been hollows, darklings. Utter madness. The isles were drenched in the light of the Glare, no hollow could have lived there without burning! Besides some savage tribes encountered in the colonies had proved that some peoples of light skin were not soulless, turned pale not by the embrace of the Gloam but simply born with such flesh. Yet it suited some to imply the people of Peredur were descended from slaves and savages, the same hordes that allied with devils to bring about the Old Night.

“Alas,” Angharad frigidly replied, “it seems I must disappoint.”

“Remund,” Lady Isabel chided, gently slapping his arm. “Be nice.”

“Oh, I suppose,” Lord Remund groused. “The pleasure is all mine, Lady Angharad.”

Isabel seemed more amused than anything, which brought a glimmer of satisfaction to the younger Cerdan’s eye that Angharad recognized. Ah, she thought. Perhaps her appreciative gaze had not been as subtle as she thought. From the corner of her eye she saw Lord Augusto eyeing the Lady Isabel and his brother with evident displeasure before brushing it away with a forced smile. He made a chiding comment about immaturity, injecting himself between the two. Angharad almost winced.

“It appears your coat was scuffed,” Lady Ferranda said, drawing back her attention. “A traveling misfortune?”

The other woman’s steady gaze lay where the stray shot had caught her overcoat earlier. Angharad had no intention of mentioning her troubles to these strangers, fellow nobles or not, but then she suspected that Ferranda Villazur was well aware she was not looking at a simple scuff.

“There was a mishap with my trunk,” Angharad replied, carefully avoiding a lie. “I will be travelling light.”

“Oh,” Lady Isabel gently said as she drew away from the brothers, “that simply won’t do. Lady Angharad – or may I call you Angharad?”

Charmed, she returned the Sacromontan’s smile.

“Of course.”

“Then call me Isabel, Angharad,” the beauty firmly offered again. “My maids can take care of mending your coat, they are very clever with their hands.”

She hesitated for a moment, but the bandage she had put over her wound on yesterday should not show under her shirt. Besides, it would be suspicious to refuse.

“I would be much obliged,” she said, shrugging off her coat.

“Beatris,” Isabel called out, summoning another handmaid. “Do mend Lady Angharad’s coat for her, would you?”

“Of course, my lady,” the dark-haired maid replied, curtsying before she approached.

She took the coat when Angharad offered it. Isabel slid a look a Lady Ferranda.

“You really should have brought a maid, Ferra,” she said. “Your man does not look like he knows how to use a needle.”

“Sanale serves a different purpose,” Lady Ferranda replied. “I can take care of my own affairs, Isabel.”

“There is no need for that hired sword, I assure you,” Lord Remund smiled. “I will be seeing to our safety, as will our good Cozme. One of the finest soldiers in Cerdan service, second only to my own finer blade.”

“If only your rapier were half as swift as your boasts,” Lord Augusto mildly said. “Though he speaks true, Lady Ferranda, that it is our duty as sons of Cerdan to see to your safety through this trial. We must never abandon woman in need.”

“How kind,” Lady Ferranda replied, her tone savagely even.

She did not seem impressed, Angharad thought, but then it was not on her that Augusto’s eyes had lingered. Lady Isabel smiled back at the older Cerdan, but in the following moment let out a little noise of surprise before flowing forward. Warm fingers grasped Angharad’s left arm, pushing up the sleeve of her shirt and baring the ten silver lines tattooed there over dark skin.

“A tattoo,” Isabel said, her touch soft. “What might it mean, Angharad?”

The looks the Cerdan brothers sent her were distinctly unfriendly. Lady Ferranda cut in before she could gather her wits enough to answer.

“Swordmistress,” the tall woman said, breathing out in surprise. “Those are the marks of a Malani swordmistress.”

They would have been, were they black and on Angharad’s right arm instead, but after that early buffoonery from Remund she was disinclined to explain the nuance.

“It is a similar tradition,” Angharad simply said.

Suddenly the Cerdans looked rather more wary of her. Wary enough to try to send her away, she figured, but whatever intention there might have been it immediately came to naught. Lady Ferranda’s eyes lit up at her admission, leading into the first smile Angharad had seen out of the other woman.

“You must stay with us, then,” Ferranda Villazur firmly said. “I happen to have a great many questions about such practices.”

—

Much as Angharad was used to the company of other nobles, she was also used to her family’s title being among the lesser in the room. Though Mother had been wealthy and of some renown as a captain, Llanw Hall was no great estate. Compared to the great izinduna families some of her tournament competitors had come from, the House of Tredegar had been ants. It had therefore been a skill worth cultivating to be able to tell who the powerful people in a room were. Playing court with the four infanzones let her fall back into the habit and it was, if not comfortable, then at least a little nostalgic.

The House of Cerdan, she learned, was by far the greatest of the noble lines involved here. Though it was not one of the founding families of Sacromonte, who traced their descent back the heyday of the Second Empire and good as ran the city, it was not far below them. While Augusto and Remund were not of the main line, they were great-nephews to the lord of the house and therefore not men to discount.

They also despised each other.

Watching them descend into thinly veiled snapping for the third time in an hour, Angharad cocked an eyebrow at Lady Ferranda. The tall noblewoman sighed, waiting until Isabel leaned forward to play peacemaker between the brothers before she answered.

“There is an inheritance involved,” she murmured. “Remund is younger but has obtained a contract. Marrying well would settle the victor.”

And Lady Isabel Ruesta would be, Angharad deduced, a very good marriage indeed. Not only was she a great beauty but she was the sole daughter of the Ruesta, a house of undistinguished descent but which happened to be very wealthy. No wonder the brothers went at each other like rabid dogs whenever one drew her attention over the other.

“Poor Isabel,” Angharad sympathized.

Lady Ferranda shrugged. She was a woman of few words and tread with care around the others. Unsurprising, given that the Villazur were the least of the three houses by a fair throw. She had been quite frank about her intent to use a strong performance in the trials to gild her family’s name and bring it back into the eyes of her fellow infanzones, perhaps even securing an advantageous husband. She had been preparing for this venture for years, going as far as to obtain the services of a man called Sanale which she claimed to be a Malani huntsman.

“Where from?” Angharad idly asked.

Given the reputation of Malani marksmen, it was not an uncommon claim even among those who’d never so much as seen the Isles.

“Does it matter what particular island tossed him out?” Remund chuckled, rolling his eyes.

“Uthukile,” Lady Ferranda replied, ignoring him.

Angharad leaned back in the seat she had been offered, taking a look at the elaborate beadwork hanging off this Sanale’s cloak where he sat among the servants. She could not see his face, but the colours of the beads were distinctive to the Low Isle. It seemed a credible claim.

“I was taught they are the finest shooters and trackers in Malan,” the noble acknowledged.

And therefore all of Vesper, though it would be impolite so say as much. Terrible seafarers, however. Mother had always mourned so few took to ships given how good they were with muskets. Lady Ferranda straightened, visibly pleased, and Isabel pouted.

“You take it all too seriously, Ferra,” the dark-haired woman claimed, then daintily rose to her feet. “And I must admit I grow weary of this dreary hold. Shall we go for a walk?”

Augusto, the older Cerdan, wasted no time in mimicking her and offering his hand.

“Too right,” he said, “you and I can-”

“No need, brother,” Lord Remund cut in. “You stay and rest, I will escort our fair lady.”

Lady Ferranda looked as if she had a dawning headache, but she stayed out of it and Angharad decided it might be best for her as well. The Cerdans argued, growing more irritated and worse at hiding it. Isabel then cut through the backbiting by offering Angharad a sweet smile.

“Would you do me the honour, Angharad?” she asked. “I never did get you to tell me of Peredur.”

The glares that earned her felt like they would burn through her clothes, which irritated her enough she accepted out of spite.

“I am at your disposal, of course,” she said, smoothly rising to her feet.

The brothers’ faces darkened, but they were not so impolite as to insist when an invitation had been clearly given and accepted. Angharad offered her arm for Isabel to take and they headed for the stairs, though her eyes strayed to the side as they moved. She’d heard Lord Remund mentioning other Malani earlier but now she was finally seeing them. Seated between crates, talking in low voices, a young pair of youths were tucked away. Behind them a scarred older woman was napping. The man of the pair, narrow-faced but built like a fighter, kept glancing around.  As if looking for something.

Or someone, Angharad realized with a trickle of cold dread. Her pursuers had known she was headed for the Bluebell, for these trials, and tried to stop her getting on the ship. But would they truly stop there when assassins had dogged her steps all the way from Peredur? It had not occurred to her until now that there might be a hired knife waiting for her on the ship. Uncle Osian’s letter had implied that there were few rules during the trials, that much was allowed. Perhaps even murder. The thought had her tensing enough that Isabel noticed. Thankfully, she misinterpreted the reason.

“They can be a little much,” the dark-haired beauty admitted. “It will do me some good to have some fresh air in good company.”

“Have they always been like this?” Angharad asked, grateful for the change of subject.

They rose up the stairs, drawing the attention of the sailors on the lower deck as they passed. No one tried to stop them, as a few hours past an officer had come to tell them it would be allowed for a few travellers at a time to come up for air so long as they stayed out of the way.

“They were sweeter, once,” Isabel wistfully said. “But we all have duties now. It complicates matters.”

Angharad inclined her head. She had never held any interest in men, but the contrary had not always been true. Her status as the heiress to Llanw Hall had sometimes made it a difficult affair to decline without giving offence as a lady. The lives of nobles did not belong to them alone.

“Sometimes I wish I could be free of all this,” Isabel confessed as they went up the last of the stairs. “That I might find love where I please instead.”

As if by fate’s whim, she finished the sentence just as the two of them took to the deck and the sight of it caught in Angharad’s throat. Lovely Isabel in her yellow brocade, with eyes like emeralds and her delicate face framed by dark hair like raven’s wings – all of it with the Trebian Sea spread out behind her as far as the eye could see, waters touched with golden lucent streaks as the great mirrors and devices in firmament above spread shards of the Glare’s light across an entire sea. It was an unearthly sight, one that dried Angharad’s mouth and left her half a babbling fool. She swallowed. Isabel smiled.

“But I must be boring you,” she said.

“Never,” Angharad insisted, cursing herself for the unseemly haste of the reply.

Isabel, if she had noticed, was kind enough not to comment as she led them to the edge of the ship. There they leaned against the side, letting the wind ruffle their hair as the Bluebell sailed across the tranquil waters of the Trebian Sea. It was a strange sight compared to the dark waters around the Isles, where the darkness of the Gloam ran deep. Unlike her own people, the powers that bordered the Trebian Sea had never had to fear a ship disappearing into the dark and returning years later – if at all. The lights coming down from firmament were only thinly of the Glare but they were enough to prevent most storms from forming and, more importantly, prevent sailors from catching Gloam sickness.

Rare were the seamen of this sea who were severed from the Circle by lack of exposure to the Glare, turning into pale hollows without an immortal soul to reincarnate.

“Look, it’s so far already!” Isabel enthused, pointing in the distance.

Angharad followed the finger to the sight of two beams of Glare falling from firmament onto a cluster of distant, lesser lights like swords cutting through the dark. Sacromonte, unlike most great cities of Vesper, had not been raised under some blessed machinery of the Antediluvians that doled out light in patterns. It stood under simple pit of Glare. The light that touched the city’s noble districts came from a hole ripped into firmament, coming raw from the unblinking sun that had turned the Old World to ash and dust. 

“You should see the Isles, one day,” Angharad chuckled, shaking her head. “They are all under one great pit whose light covers all but the furthest edges of Peredur and Uthukile. It can be seen from weeks away if there is no Gloam storm hiding it.”

“I would much like to travel, one day,” Isabel smiled, “but surely our corner of Vesper does have some charms?”

Angharad bit down on a very smitten answer by forcing herself to look away. A shape on the horizon delivered her beleaguered spirit a reply that would not make a fool of her. She nodded, pointing at a crooked and half-submerged tower jutting out of the sea in the distance. It glittered with great broken mirrors and aether machinery.

“Certainly, there is nowhere else where so many ancient wonders remain,” Angharad said.

Though many were now broken as the tower must be, their purpose lost to centuries or their intricate mechanisms beyond even the finest craftsmen of Tianxia. The Antediluvians had built their miracles in the ancient times of the First Empire, untold centuries ago, and Vesper had gone through many a ruin since.

“I would have thought fresher delights able to be found,” Isabel told her, tone gone a little tart.

Angharad coughed, embarrassed, as she tried to read the other woman’s face to no avail. The dark-haired beauty sighed, idly laying a hand on Angharad’s arm. The noble cursed the knots in her tongue that were stubbornly refusing to undo. And to think she’d been complimented on an artful seduction by her last lover!

“Tell me of Peredur,” Isabel asked, perhaps taking pity.

Angharad gratefully did, speaking of the stony and barren shores where forests of ships nestled in secret inlets, of the green rolling hills and deep forests that grew as one travelled east. Isabel seemed fascinated, always asking more, and though it all felt like it had only been a moment the ache of her arms against the side of the ship told it had been much longer than that. It was time to take their leave, but Angharad begged off going back down with her companion. She spoke of wanting to have a last look around the deck, though the truth was that she wanted to put herself together.

It was a sweet parting and Angharad closed her eyes, letting out a long breath. She had been much too obvious and was ashamed of herself. It had been improper behaviour for a lady of her breeding and a poor idea besides, given how Isabel Ruesta had some rather insistent suitors after her. Regaining her calm, she opened her eyes to see the ship approaching the ruined tower she’d sighted earlier. In the waters around it, tucked under dark ripples, ghostly shapes were swimming. She squinted, leaning further over the side, and made out a stripe going down a spine that bore the ghostly light and some spindly arms. From the fresh angle she could even see that some of the creatures were swimming besides the ship.

“Mantics.”

Angharad nearly leapt out of her skin, drawing back and reaching for her blade as she turned towards the woman who’d addressed her. Tianxi, she saw, and wearing her dark hair in a braid down her back. A fair girl no older than Angharad herself but whose silver eyes were unsettling. The more she saw them, the more she grew convinced they were not of a natural shade. The Pereduri noble’s hand stayed close to her sabre’s hilt for the other woman had a weapon of her own: a straight sword in the Tianxi style, a jian.

“I beg your pardon?”

“They’re called mantics, the creatures you’re looking at,” the stranger elaborated. “Lierganen claim they feed on the corpses of sailors who died too young. They are scavengers, however, lares and not lemures.”

Most nations did not speak of the world as Malani and Pereduri did, all spirits under the Sleeping God, but instead used the old Lierganen terms. ‘Lares’, for beasts that partook of aether but were not necessarily hostile to men, and ‘lemures’ for those that hunted mankind out of hatred regardless of need.

“Thank you for the lesson,” Angharad slowly replied.

She even half meant it.

“The interesting thing,” the stranger mused, “is that they are said to avoid ships.”

Angharad frowned.

“Some are following us,” she pointed out.

“And have been for several hours now,” the stranger agreed. “It is the third time I have come up to look.”

The noble took a wary step back. This no longer felt to her as a meeting of happenstance, idle talk between shipmates.

“Who are you?” she asked. “Why are you approaching me?”

“I simply wanted to have a look at the woman shots were fired over,” the Tianxi calmly replied. “As for my name, you may call me Song.”

Angharad’s fingers closed around the hilt of her blade.

“You’ve had your look,” she said.

“So I have,” Song agreed. “And you are as interesting as I thought you might be, so I leave you with a warning.”

The Tianxi made to leave, pausing only before she passed Angharad.

“Do not let yourself think this ship is safe. At this rate, there will be trouble long before we reach the island.”

And on that ominous note, the dark-haired stranger walked away. The noble watched her go, the grip on her sabre loosening only when this ‘Song’ disappeared below deck.

The wind brushed against her face, and Angharad was left wondering if it had always been so cold.

# Chapter 5

Tristan needed a way in.

The infanzones had claimed a corner of the hold and were entertaining the sole foreigner they’d decided was worth their time, mere feet away but far beyond his reach. The thief did have to admit the Malani they’d picked was a fearsome specimen, with two inches of height on him and a build hinting she could handle that saber she was dragging around. Unlike the noblewoman he was unlikely to get invited for refreshments, however, so he’d have to find another angle. Fortunately one was there for the taking: the infanzones had brought attendants with them. Six people in all, and one would be his key.

The soldiers, as soldiers did, went to dice the moment their masters ceased paying attention. Even the grim-faced Malani huntsman in Villazur service went, joining a tall man in Ruesta colours and the man Tristan would kill before this was all over: Cozme Aflor, thrice accursed and may the fucking devils of Pandemonium eat him whole. There had already been a game going near the mass of crates in the back of the hold, so after the soldiers joined Tristan simply did the same. The welcome was lukewarm until he flashed some coppers, which were in short supply. Most were playing for buttons or trinkets.

“We’re playing Augur,” a dark-haired woman enthusiastically told him. “No matches, Sacromonte rules.”

“Which are nonsense,” a scarred Malani complained. “Why would the Lovers’ Stars make you lose?”

Considering most the circle was Sacromontans, she won herself a few unfriendly stares with that.

“We call them the Rat King’s eyes,” Cozme smiled, stroking his beard. “He is not a god whose attentions are kind.”

Tristan smirked. It was an old legend that the Rat King had been but a pack of rats, once, but that they had devoured one of the Manes – those great pristine gods so beloved of the infanzones – and become a deity even those old things feared. There were a thousand gods worshipped and bargained with in the mud of the Murk, but few as beloved as the Rat King. He was as a patron to the lost and beggared, those who dwelled in shadow and filth. Not the kind of god that would look well upon the likes of Cozme Aflor.

“It’s the usual way,” the same dark-haired woman insisted. “Play or leave.”

The grizzled Malani sighed but picked up the dice, dropping them in a wooden cup before shaking it. Tristan had played Augur before, it was the simplest of dicing games, and so he was not afraid of losing too badly. He was not here to win anyhow. Betting low, he made sure to stay in the game as the dicers began to chat. The pushy dark-haired one who’d lit up at the sight of his coppers was called Aines, and now he recognized her from earlier. She was the woman married to the dust addict. Said man was napping, which spared him the sight of his wife losing badly at Augur.

Gods but Tristan had never seen someone so genuinely terrible at a game of chance.

He was grateful for it, as her emptying pile of buttons loosened tongues. Winning always put folk in a fine mood. Information slowly trickled in. The huntsman come with the Villazur was named Sanale, though he spoke little save when the other Malani addressed him in some foreign tongue. Tristan knew a little Umoya, but whatever they spoke only seemed to have so much in common with the best known tongue out of the Isles. Inyoni, the older woman with the scars who’d complained about the rules earlier, was a great deal chattier in everyone’s shared Antigua. The thief asked casually about the other two Malani she’d come with earlier in the day, soon surprised at easily getting an answer he’d figured he would have to finesse out.

“The boy’s my nephew,” Inyoni said. “I’m coming along to keep an eye on him.”

“Family is the most important thing,” Aines agreed.

The man in Ruesta colours rolled his eyes at them. This one was called Recardo, and though he was not as large as the Aztlan legbreaker it was a close thing. Closely shaved, he had the kind of well-proportioned face that Tristan knew was considered handsome. He was also, to put it in a single word, a shit.

“Women’s talk,” Recardo mocked before pushing a copper on a bet below four.

Aines bet two buttons on above nine, solid odds she had somehow already lost thrice on.

“There’s no need for rudeness,” Cozme drawled, pushing his own bet on eight precise.

He liked to look like a good man, Cozme Aflor. Tristan had been young but he remembered that much. The others on the List had been demanding, often rude, but Cozme had always been kind with his father. Told him with a smile that it would be over soon, that he just needed to get through it. He’d still had that same smile on his face when pulling the trigger. The thief’s gaze must have lingered, for the bearded man glanced at him curiously. There was not a speck of recognition on the Cozme’s face, not that he had expected one. He’d been but a child when they last met. Tristan smiled, burying his hatred deep.

“What is it like, working for infanzones?” the thief asked, feigning fascination.

Cozme did not hide his smugness.

“Exhausting, but rewarding in its own way,” he claimed. “Though in truth I serve not the brothers but one of their uncles, so they must listen to me in all things.”

Tristan doubted that very much but nodded as if admiring. Recardo, who’d been listening to them, laughed.

“The perks are shit when working for the Cerdan,” the big man said. “Now me? I get to look over Lady Isabel and her pretty little maids, there’s a real prize.”

It was not the first time tonight he mentioned the maids, which he seemed to be laying claim on to an entirely disinterested audience. The huntsman Sanale eyed the other man, then muttered something to the other Malani. Tristan smothered a smile when he recognized the words in Umoya, which translated to something like ‘crow-meat’. A grinning Inyoni rolled the dice, a three and five. Aines cursed disbelievingly, Cozme smirking as he claimed the pot. Recardo looked none to pleased at having lost, his coppers thinning.

“We ought to get the valet in there,” the big man said. “Go get him, Cozme.”

“Gascon attending to the brothers is why I can sit here in peace,” the bearded man replied, shaking his head. “Besides, he’s not as bad with money as you think.”

And like that Tristan had what he wanted: names and faces for all six attendants. Recardo seemed like the kind of man that would be easy to get talking when plied with liquor and flattery, but entirely too unreliable to be used. Neither Sanale nor Cozme could be his key either. The Malani was quiet and distant while Tristan was not sure how well he’d be able to hide his hatred if he spent too long around the other man. That left the personal servants. Since the Cerdan valet was even now polishing the boots of the brothers, Tristan’s gaze moved to the Ruesta handmaids. It’d have to be one of them.

Now he just needed to get rid of one last problem.

“Four radizes on below five,” Fortuna demanded in his ear, draped over his shoulder. “This one’s a win, I can feel it in my bones.”

Tristan grimaced. He could not risk even a whisper, not so close to so many people. Irksome when he was itching to point that she did not, in fact, have bones.

“Come on,” Fortuna insisted. “When have I ever steered you wrong?”

Every single time he’d gambled, he silently replied. He put two coppers on six exact instead.

“Wait, no, you’re right,” she muttered. “This is better. All in, Tristan. Bet everything.”

Fortuna, as befitting of the Lady of Long Odds, only had two stratagems in games of chance: doubling down or going all in. He ignored her, which proved warranted when a moment later two fives were rolled and he lost his coppers. He then used the loss as a pretext for retreat, forcing himself to ignore Fortuna’s indignant howling.

“We had them, Tristan,” the goddess bellowed. “Our luck was turning around, I’m sure of it. We just needed to keep at it a little longer.”

Abuela had taught him that gods always craved something. It was in their nature: they were aether given face through mankind’s touch, leaving them with hungers that they could only satisfy through men. It was what gods got from contracts, a way to sate those hungers, and the same reason that if he listened to Fortuna he would bet on bad dice until he was destitute. It was that one in a hundred thousand victory she craved, the Long Odds come true. To her losing a thousand times for that single unlikely win would be nothing more than suffering through overcooked greens to get at a juicy side of pork.

“We’ll try again later,” Tristan murmured, pretending to be brushing his knee so he could hide his mouth.

“You always say that,” Fortuna pouted, “but then we never do.”

She was pouting, so the storm had passed. She’d stay snippy about it for a bit then before the turn of the hour entirely forget. With that seen to, he turned his attention back to the handmaids. Both were near their mistress, who was playing at court with the other nobles and ignoring them so long as she did not need anything fetched. One, a short dark-haired woman whose name he had learned was Beatris, was finishing up mending a coat with needle and thread. The other, a redhead whose name was Briceida – information obtained through Recardo’s boasting he would get her in bed – was paging through a book with a bored look. Tristan got closer but not enough to earn more than an indifferent glance from either, waiting for an opportunity.

It came when Beatris began to put away her needle in a neat box, a sight he answered by immediately borrowing luck.

The ticking began in the back of his mind, a clock’s moving gears, and a heartbeat later the box slipped through the maid’s hands. Needles and threads spilled all over the floor, the woman letting out a horrified gasp, and even as he rose to help her Tristan released the luck he’d borrowed. Fortune snapped back, lightly so for the lightness of what he’d taken, but it returned with unerring aim. A wooden bobbin rolled under his foot and he slipped with a started yelp, falling forward. Tristan landed on his knees, only a hand keeping his face off the bottom of the hold, and did his best to ignore Fortuna’s hysterical laughter.

“Sweet Manes, are you alright?”

Sighing, the thief looked up at Beatris’ face – she was trying to hide her amusement but failing – and dragged himself back up.

“Nothing was wounded save my pride,” he wryly replied. “Would you like a hand?”

“That is kind of you to offer,” the maid said, sounding surprised. “It would be appreciated.”

The threads had rolled away in every direction and needles were hard to pick out in the gloom of the hold, so it was genuine work to get them back. The other maid ignored them as they scuttled about, at first, until finally she closed her book with a loud sigh and got up. Brushing back red curls, she bent and picked up a single bobbin of blue thread as Beatris was reaching out for it. It was dropped into the box almost contemptuously before Briceida turned a sneer on the both of them.

“Careful the vagrant doesn’t pocket some of Lady Isabel’s things, Beatris,” the redhead said, then her lips quirked cruelly. “Though maybe he’ll cut you in so you can finally afford a decent dress.”

“I’ll take responsibility if there is a mishap, Briceida,” Beatris curtly replied.

“Drop things less, then,” Briceida advised. “Your breeding is showing.”

And on that parting shot she flounced away, leaving dark-haired Beatris struggling not look furious. It passed after a moment and the maid turned an apologetic look on the thief.

“I’m sorry,” she said.

“What for?” Tristan snorted. “She seems a horrid bitch.”

A gamble, but he liked his odds. Beatris’ mouth closed but she was not quite able to silence the laugh startling its way out of her throat. Under Tristan’s smiling gaze the maid convulsed a few times, then erupted into giggles.

“She really is,” Beatris admitted. “You’d think she were a king’s daughter instead of a drapier’s.”

Ah, Tristan thought. So it was like that. Drapiers were wealthy men and the pressing reason one’s daughter would be serving as handmaid to a lady was so she might use that foothold in noble circles to marry up. Meaning Briceida was a maid only until she found better, while Beatris would be a servant for life. Their status – and treatment – would be starkly different. Good for him, though. An enemy, especially a common one, would make it easier to forge ties.

“My sympathies,” the thief told her, finding he meant it.

The dark-eyed maid looked up at him for a moment, then hummed. Bringing her hand to the side of her dress as if to straighten it, she discreetly curled her fore and middle fingers. The thief hid his surprise at the sight of the Mark of the Rat being made, pretending to scratch at his sideburns while returning it. Beatris smiled.

“Had a feeling you might be,” she said.

“Born in Feria,” he told her.

Feria District was of the nicer parts of the Murk. He’d not stayed there – without his father, there had been no affording the rent set by the Cerdan – but telling Beatris he’d cut his teeth in rougher places like Araturo and Cayerar would do him no favours. The dark-haired maid’s smiled grew more genuine.

“I am as well,” she told him. “The north end, near Araturo.”

“East for me, around Weeper’s avenue,” he shared.

She looked impressed, though she should not have been.

“Before they prettied it up,” he clarified.

These last few years the noble House of Cerdan had cleaned up some of the many streets they owned in Feria. Mostly so they could raise the rents, throwing out the old tenants and replacing them with wealthier migrants that couldn’t find rooms in the ever-overcrowded Quays. A lucrative racket, by all reports.

“Figures,” Beatris drily said, eyeing him up and down.

He grinned back. Tristan was cleaner than most, for a dirty thief would not be allowed into anywhere worth robbing, but he still had filth under his fingernails. He’d not bathed in a few days even if his clothes were clean. Not so for the maid, who even smelled faintly of lilac. Before he could tease her about that, an interruption bowled them over. Lady Isabel Ruesta was barely taller than Beatris and just as dark-haired, but she was hard to mistake for the other. The infanzon had an indolence about her particular to those that’d never done a day’s work in their life.  

“It was lovely of you to help Beatris,” the Ruesta told him, smiling and laying a hand on his wrist. “May I have your name, sir?”

It was an effort not to allow distaste to show on his face.

“Tristan,” the thief smiled back. “It is my honour to meet you, Lady Ruesta.”

The infanzon tittered.

“Call me Lady Isabel,” she insisted. “It is the least I can do for someone who so gallantly helped my maid.”

She shot Beatris a look of condescending fondness.

“She is not usually so clumsy, I swear to you.”

Beatris bent her head before her mistress, murmuring apologies that were airily dismissed. Practice kept Tristan’s smile from growing visibly stiff.

“It must be the ship,” the thief said. “Journeys have their difficulties.”

The noble brat nodded.

“Too true,” she said, smile brightening. “Yet they are so very exciting!”

She patted his arm again.

“I do hope to see more of you, Tristan,” the Ruesta said. “We shall talk again.”

She flounced off as suddenly as she had flounced in, returning to her nest of nobles. The grey-eyed thief waited until she was settled to turn to Beatris and roll his eyes.

“Would it be rude,” he said, “to offer my sympathies twice?”

The dark-haired maid blinked, then turned an intense gaze on him.

“No,” she slowly said. “But you mean-”

Beatris hesitated.

“Did you not find her charming?”

“The opposite,” Tristan frankly replied.

Beatris’ face twisted in surprise, to his own. She bit her lip.

“Forgive me for the indiscretion,” the maid said. “But are you perhaps…”

She gestured vaguely, but the meaning itself was clear enough. It was not particularly polite to ask strangers if they were homosexual, however, so he cocked an eyebrow.

“Why would that matter?”

Beatris bit her lip again, then leaned closer.

“She has a contract,” the dark-eyed maid whispered. “I don’t know the terms, but it seems to charm people – only those that are attracted to her, though, at least I think.”

The thief felt sick at the realization that the fucking infanzon had been turning a contract on him the entire time she was pretending to play nice, jaw clenching. It couldn’t give her too much control over others, he knew, else she would be in breach of the Iscariot Accords and the Watch would have purged the entire Ruesta family. Yet the thought that she had been seeking to influence his mind was still nauseating. He hid his anger, lest someone notice it, but there had been no avoiding the maid’s eyes. It’d be safer to concede an answer to keep her on side, he decided.

“I do not deal in attraction,” Tristan told her. “Not physical, at least.”

“Asexual?” Beatris asked.

He shrugged. The thief had never much cared to put a name to his inclinations – or lack thereof – but he supposed it fit well enough. He’d caught feelings once or twice over the years, but it had not changed his distaste for sex. For all that he’d remained vague, Beatris significantly warmed to him after. Was she truly so desperate for company that would not be charmed by her despicable mistress? It must be so, for as the two of them sat near the nobles’ travelling trunks the dark-haired woman gossiped away at him with great eagerness. Tristan swallowed a smile of triumph when the talk turned to the infanzones.

“She’s been stringing along the Cerdan brothers for about a year now,” Beatris noted. “Making them fight for her attention, knowing they want her hand in marriage to settle their inheritance dispute.”

“The brothers are at odds?” Tristan casually asked.

“Hate each other, more like,” Beatris snorted. “The only reason they’re taking the trials is to chase Lady Isabel. If it weren’t for Cozme Aflor coming along to keep them in line, I’d be worried about them trying to bump each other off.”

“He was boasting about them having to listen to him earlier,” the thief shared.

“He’s full of shit,” the maid replied. “I talked with the maids of a Cerdan cousin when Lady Isabel last called on Lord Augusto and they told me word in the house is that he’s being sent as punishment. He used to be in high favour but botched some kind of affair with House Ragoza.”

“He’s here to make sure they both come back,” Tristan surmised.

“The poor bastard,” Beatris agreed. “It’s cruel to play with them so, but I can understand why the lady doesn’t want to marry them. Remund was a real bastard even before he got his contract, but the talk since he got it is worse.”

He cocked his head to the side.

“Apparently he trains using it on servants,” she murmured. “Some sort of light he can make shackles with, but it burns the skin. One showed me marks.”

How was it, Tristan wondered, that even knowing they were monstrous he was still angered at hearing of the petty cruelty of Cerdans?

“And the elder brother’s as bad?” he asked.

“I still have family in Feria,” Beatris said, “and they passed on rumours. He was placed in charge of the Cerdan properties there a few years back, rents and such, and he’s got a… reputation.”

The implication there was an ugly one. Tristan wished it was the first time he had heard it spoken, or that it had even the slightest chance of being the last.

“How bad?”

“It’s said he doesn’t force the girls into bed,” the maid admitted. “But he’ll hold off on collecting a debt or a rent if he’s kept company.”

Kept company. What a gentle way to put it. They were both children of the Murk, so they knew well that in life some choices were not really choices at all.

“Pieces of work,” Tristan said, the hatred in his voice old and lovingly tended to. “I’m almost rooting for Ruesta to make them bare knives.”

“She won’t,” Beatris said, shaking her head. “For the same reason I know she won’t marry either: she’s keeping her reputation pristine so she can get the husband she does want. An older cousin on her mother’s side, from a branch of the Livares.”

Tristan’s brow rose. The House of Livares was one of the founding families of Sacramonte. Isabel Ruesta did not lack for ambition, to seek marriage into even one of the lesser branches.

“She’ll need more than contract to win that,” he opined.

Beatris nodded.

“It’s why she decided to take the trials,” the maid said. “The cousin is taking them as well, gone over on the first ship. She’ll be pursuing him throughout the whole mess.”

“While playing with the Cerdans the whole time,” Tristan muttered. “Infanzones. Like it won’t be dangerous enough already.”

“She’ll pick up a few others to toy with,” Beatris predicted. “Already she’s sunk her hooks into that poor Malani girl.”

“The one with the saber?”

“That’s the one. Some kind of fallen noble from the Isles, I think,” the maid shrugged. “Already smitten and getting used to prick the brothers.”

“At least she looks like she can handle a blade,” Tristan said. “Another sword arm can’t hurt on the Dominion of Lost Things.”

“I suppose,” she doubtfully replied.

“Though I expect you’d be safer than most without,” the thief said, tone carefully idle. “I’d be surprised if the infanzones hadn’t made a pact to share their soldiers.”

He hoped not, for it would complicate getting at Cozme and the Cerdans, but that was not the way of the world. Nobles always closed rank, hid each other’s vileness.

“All but Lady Villazur,” Beatris absent-mindedly confirmed. “She’s been putting off answering. But safety is a… relative thing.”

The dark-haired maid turned an anxious but hopeful look on him. Tristan had been asked enough favours by the more desperate than he to recognize when someone was about to do it.

“I saw you dicing earlier,” Beatris said. “Did you perhaps chat with a man named Recardo?”

The large Ruesta soldier, Tristan thought. The same who’d been warning everyone off Lady Isabel’s two maids, since he had a ‘claim’ on them.

“You came up,” the thief said, not beating around the bush. “He seemed very certain his advances would be accepted.”

“I’m worried,” the dark-eyed maid quietly said, “that he’s certain because he won’t care if I am accepting.”

Tristan stilled.

“You are a lady’s handmaid,” he slowly said.

“I’m not a drapier’s daughter, Tristan,” Beatris tiredly replied. “He wouldn’t dare on Ruesta grounds, but out here? I’m just some girl plucked out of the Murk because I resembled Lady Isabel when we were children. So long as he does it out of sight…”

She must have been body double as well as a handmaid, he thought. Only now Beatris was shorter and broader than Isabel Ruesta, so her value had taken a sharp dive: the two resembled each other no more than any other pair of dark-haired women close in age.

“So you’re looking to make friends,” he said.

“I can be useful to you too,” Beatris firmly retorted. “I already proved it with all the things I’ve been telling you, haven’t I? Besides, I’m a way for you to get in with their group and that’s exactly why you’ve been sniffing around.”

He eyed the maid, a smile tugging at his lips unbidden.

“A proper rat you are,” Tristan praised. “Name your terms.”

She straightened her back.

“Keep an eye out for me when he’s prowling,” the maid said. “If I’m sent out alone, make an excuse to follow. I don’t expect you to win a fight against a soldier, but if you just delay him long enough I can run…”

Then she could get back to the others and make a ruckus. Lady Isabel would have to act if confronted with such a situation, else she would lose all honour and her reputation would be ruined. Who would serve a noble that did not protect her own handmaids? Still, more likely Beatris was betting on Recardo not being willing to take the risk of trying anything if there was a witness given the consequences of getting caught. A practical solution. Only he needed a little more from her.

“I’ve made another friend,” Tristan said. “A former soldier. I want him to be invited as well.”

The maid hesitated.

“It’s to your advantage as well,” he pressed. “Two of us watching out for you, one more pair of hands if Recardo tries his luck – and a pair trained in fighting at that.”

The promise of someone that might be able to handle the large Ruesta soldier in a fight was what tipped the decision, Tristan decided as he watched her. The dark-haired maid nodded, first with hesitation but then briskly the second time.

“They’ll start looking around for people to grow their numbers tomorrow,” Beatris said. “I attended to Lady Isabel this morning while they discussed it. I’ll make sure you and your friend get in.”

“Then we have a bargain,” Tristan replied. “On my oath, may a hundred gods bite me should I break it.”

Beatris returned the promise in kind. It was said that in ancient times the great sages of Liergan had known how to make such oaths binding, but even if the tale was true the words had long outlived the learning. Now it was simple ceremony. Before they parted ways, Tristan lightly laid a hand on her arm to stop her.

“I have a wonder,” he said.

“Yes?”

“If a great misfortune was to strike Recardo,” Tristan asked with the softness of a feather, “would you then also consider our bargain upheld?”

Beatris breathed in sharply, dark eyes searching his face. She hesitated for a long moment, only for her back to straighten again.

“The hungry bite, the beggared snatch,” she softly quoted back.

The cornered fight, Tristan finished. So went the Law of Rats, and though they might have left the Murk the Murk had not left them. She did not need to speak the word for him to hear the agreement. Nodding his understanding, he bade her a silent farewell. Closing his eyes as he listened to her footsteps moving away, Tristan made himself go over the conversation again. He had made no obvious mistakes or betrayed his interest in seeing half the infanzones aboard dead, he decided. A victory then, however uneasy it made him. He would have to ponder a way to get rid of Recardo if the opportunity came.

The pact between the nobles to share their soldiers meant killing the man would be useful anyhow.

Now he only needed to sell the bargain he’d struck to Yong, on whose behalf he had also bargained, but he did not anticipate conflict there. The soldier had plainly told him he sought only to get to the third trial, nothing else mattering to him. Using the infanzones for safety, at least for a time, would be a boon. The Tianxi was laying slumped in a corner and reeking of booze when Tristan found him, but his eyes were open and he was studying the lay of the hold.

“Alliances are forming,” Yong said, tone slurring. “Look.”

The thief sat before following the pointed finger, wrinkling his nose at the smell of liquor. His ally, however drunk, was correct. Groups were forming. The first around that disturbingly perfect-looking Aztlan that came recommended. The large legbreaker from the Menor Mano was sitting with him, as was the pair from Asphodel: both the young noble with acne and the gaunt exhausted man Tristan had been warned about. Leander Galatas, here on recommendation by the Navigator’s Guild and might hold knowledge of Signs. The twins were eyeing them up as well, visibly considering tying themselves to that crew even as they spoke with the Aztlan woman he knew nothing about.

On the opposite end of the hold another alliance was coming together, looking a lot more convivial. The two younger Malani that Inyoni was keeping an eye one were chatting with the pair of Ramayans that’d also come together, the lot of them all close in age and well-dressed. Inyoni’s nephew looked nervous, always looking around as if expecting to be jumped, but all four were armed and even the chubby-cheeked Ramayan boy looked like he knew how to handle his pistol. With a veteran like Inyoni behind them, they would be a crew to reckon with. Three forces, Tristan mused. The infanzones and their attendants, Tupoc Xical with his recruits and this band of five.

The rest, he suspected, would be leftovers. The oldest two on the boat were seated close but not talking and no one had approached them. Meanwhile the married couple was arguing in a low voice and Marzela… where was Marzela? Probably hiding in some corner. Looking for Brun, Tristan was unsurprised to see the man Fortuna had warned him about landing on his feet. He was chatting with a flattered-looking Briceida, not a trace of sneer on the redhead maid’s face. That left only the Raseni whose name he had never learned and the well-armed Tianxi recommended by the Rookery, the two of them talking when he glanced their way.

A conversation soon ended, though, and they went different ways.

“Did you get anything out of the maid?” Yong asked.

“A bargain,” Tristan murmured. “We watch her back against the Ruesta guard and she gets us in with the infanzones.”

The Tianxi solider let out a whistle that was a little too loud, drawing eyes to them. Tristan pushed down a squirm of discomfort.

“Good work,” Yong praised. “I was thinking we’d have to work our way in with Tupoc’s crew but the nobles are a better horse to ride.”

“He approached you?” Tristan asked.

“Came around,” the drunk said. “But he’s gathering killers and I don’t want to be one of them unless I know why.”

The thief grunted in agreement.

“He’s not the only one that got curious,” Yong continued. “The Raseni’s been keeping an eye on you all afternoon.”

Tristan forced himself not to look at her and give the game away.

“She speak to anyone so far?”

“That Tianxi girl that walks like she’s done Republic drills,” the soldier began to list. “Brun, that terrified girl you rubbed elbows with. Oh, and the Ramayan gunslinger – but only before the pair started cozying up with the Malani.”

Looking for allies? If so, she was not doing well. The thief glanced her way and found she was standing alone. It was hard to tell anything about her, given the way Raseni dressed whenever they left their city-state. The woman wore a grey dress that went down to knee-high boots, embroidered leather gloves and layered grey veils that reached halfway down her torso and were kept in place by a painted wooden circle atop her head. The only opening was for the eyes, a dull copper mask carefully worn there to keep everything covered except the eyeholes.

It was said the folk of Rasen thought their island the only untainted land in all of Vesper, hiding their bodies outside it so they would not lead evil back to their home. All Tristan could tell about the Raseni was that she was about of height with him, tall for a woman, and that those gloves and boots were worn from use. The boots in particular were – the thief stilled.

“Yong,” he murmured. “Look at the Raseni’s boots.”

“They do look comfortable,” the Tianxi agreeably replied

“What colour would you say the stitches are?”

The soldier shot him a strange look.

“Dark blue?” he finally said, shrugging.

So they were. Tristan had not met many Raseni, but back when he’d run messages for a Roja frontman near the docks he’d learned a few things about them. Like the way they never wore anything blue below the belt, since it drew the attention of evil gods. There was no way a Raseni religious enough to observe full veiling would not know that. Which means I’m not looking at a Raseni. Hitching himself up, the thief brushed his trousers clean before walking away from a baffled Yong. Unhurried, Tristan crossed the hold until he reached the false Raseni and leaned against the wall to her left.

“I do not believe,” the stranger said, “that we have been introduced.”

No accent. Her Antigua had that cadence to it common to those who’d learned the language late, but nothing about the way she spoke hinted about where she was from. It was, he mused, an aggressively unaccented way of speaking and so almost certainly practiced. He didn’t immediately reply, instead leaning his head back against the wall. When he finally spoke, his tone was barely above a whisper.

“I am trying to think,” the thief said, “of a reason for why you’d pick Rasen of all places as way to hide your identity. I can’t seem to find one.”

He looked up at the ceiling, the play of shadows lined by the lantern lights.

“In Old Saraya masks are worn by certain trades,” he said, “and surely hair dye would have been easier than going around in a full Raseni veiling if you only sought to hide your identity.”

“Are you accusing me of something?”

“You’re wearing blue under the belt,” Tristan plainly said. “Raseni do not.”

“Not unless we have been exiled,” she replied.

A tense moment passed.

“Did you think I’d buy that?” he curiously asked.

A sigh, then she shuffled on her feet.

“I should have sprung for the boots without stitches,” she muttered.

He hummed. Her eyes were blue, he glimpsed through the slits of the copper mask.

“You’re not going to introduce yourself?” she asked.

“You’ve kept an eye on me all day,” the thief said. “You already know my name.”

A guess, but one he liked his odds on. She did not deny it.

“So the Tianxi’s your ally,” the stranger said. “Thought as much.”

“You had to be looking close to notice that,” he said. “What is it you’ve been looking at us for?”

“I haven’t decided yet,” she lightly replied. “Besides, that’s ahead of us. Here and now I would like to offer you a deal.”

He cocked his head to the side.

“Your silence,” the veiled woman offered, “for knowledge that might save your life.”

Tristan eyed her searchingly but there was no face to read, only dull copper and cloth. It might end up useful leverage to out her as an impostor, he considered, but it was not certain. Most here did not have a reason to care. Better to get something certain than hold on to something he might never use. And if she told him something useless? Then he would still have learned something, only about her.

“Agreed,” he replied.

“The noblewoman picked up by the infanzones,” the stranger said, “has ten silver lines tattooed on her left arm.”

“So she’s a Malani swordmistress,” Tristan frowned.

They were dangerous folk, he’d heard, feared even by the bloodthirsty champions of Aztlan warrior societies.

“No,” the woman said. “It’s on the wrong arm, in the wrong colour. She’s a Pereduri mirror-dancer.”

Wasn’t Peredur part of the Kingdom of Malan? One of the islands.

“There’s a difference, I take it,” the thief said.

“Swordmasters gain their lines in honour duels. Bloody fights, but deaths aren’t common. On the High Isle, to win a line you’re taken to the shore on a specific day of the year.”

“To duel?”

“In a manner of speaking,” she said. “There’s a kind of lemure there called grey mirrors. They prey on lone travellers and fishermen, taking their form and then eating the body to gain some of its memories.”

Tristan’s disbelieving gaze, against his will, went to the noblewoman they were talking about. Blissfully unaware of the attention, she was telling a story to the Villazur.

“You can’t be serious.”

“They wait until the mirror takes the form of the one trying for the line,” the stranger evenly said, “then toss it a sword of its own, for fairness. They win or die, facing themselves year after year.”

If the Mala- the Pereduri could only take such a trial once a year and she had ten stripes, she must have begun when she was still a child. Ten, eleven? Young.

“Don’t ever face that woman sword in hand,” the stranger warned, “unless you are looking to die.”

That was knowledge well worth a secret kept, and Tristan did not hide his appreciation. He’d come out ahead in this bargain, perhaps even a little too much. Best to even the scales, lest he be in the stranger’s debt.

“The Ruesta girl has a contract that charms others,” he murmured. “Though there are restrictions.”

The veiled woman stayed a silent for a moment.

“That,” she finally said, “could be trouble.”

It was obvious enough he did not bother to voice agreement. Besides, he’d got what he came here for and more. It was time to take his leave.

“Since you have my name,” Tristan said, “it would only be fair for me to receive yours.”

She shot him a considering look, as if debating what she would use.

“Sarai.”

“It’s been worthwhile, Sarai,” he said, inclining his head.

“So it has,” she agreed. “We’ll speak again on the island.”

Surprisingly, he found himself looking forward to it. He’d barely taken a step away from the veiled woman when he heard a gunshot, body tensing as he went for his knife. He realized a moment later that it had come from the decks above, though he’d not been the only one alarmed: there were several others on their feet and just as wary. A second later another shot sounded, then what had to be a dozen more. They did not stop.

“We’re under attack,” Cozme Aflor shouted. “Arm yourselves!”

Pirates? Surely not, for what kind of a fool would attack a Watch ship when they carried few goods and were certain to be full of soldiers? Even as the travellers of the hold went for their weapons, Tristan’s gaze swept through them again as instinct had him counting the heads. Shit, the thief thought. Marzela was still missing. The same terrified girl he was certain had been drawing on her contract compulsively since coming onboard. A sinking feeling in his stomach, Tristan brushed past the pair of Ramayans and climbed atop one of the crates in the back. He heard a man’s voice laughing, asking if he was going to hide, but he ignored it as he crawled forward.

The back of the hold was a tightly packed mass of crates, but over one’s edge Tristan saw some sort of cloth peeking out. Cursing again he crawled closer, seeing then it was not cloth at all. It was some sort of webbing, like a spider’s. And behind that crate, nesting among threads of webbing, was horror. What had been Marzela barely clung on to human shape, milky blind eyes having grown all over her head while spindly legs ending in claws had ripped their way out of her sides and torso. She held herself in her own arms, the skin webbed together, and when a noise of terrified disgust ripped its way out of Tristan’s throat she suddenly twitched. She’s waking up. Milky eyes swam into focus and the thief threw himself back.

“SAINT,” he shouted. “SAINT IN THE HOLD!”

He didn’t even see what hit him, a keening sound filling his ears as pain exploded across his back and he tumbled through a broken crate. Fuck, his shoulder. Tristan rose out of a spill of seeds just in time to see the Saint scuttling through the hold while half a dozen people fired at it, carelessly slapping down the Aztlan legbreaker when it stood in her way. The god wearing Marzela let out a moaning sound when shots tore at its flesh, but it would take more than musket balls to put it down. Not that it seemed inclined to stay at the bottom of the ship: bleeding black ichor, the monster climbed up the wall to the ceiling and ripped its way clean through the wood.

“Oh spirits,” someone moaned.

Even as it climbed through the hole, the Saint let out another keening moan before disappearing. A moment later Tristan got a glimpse of what the blackcloaks had been shooting at all this time. Mantics. Of all the bloody things, it was mantics. Leering creatures barely two feet long, dragging themselves on long clawed hands as their disturbingly humans faces bared fangs. Only the scavengers were gone wild, spilling down into the hold by the dozens and savagely going for those closest to them. Tristan backed away from the mess, watching as Tupoc Xical calmly finished putting together a spear and harpooned the closest lares without batting an eye.

Violence broke the spell of surprise, the rest of the hold exploding into action. Keeping an eye on the infanzones, Tristan saw that they were already moving towards the upper deck. Looking to the blackcloacks to save their necks, no doubt. But they were leaving fighters behind, only Cozme heading up with them, and the cold place in the back of his mind saw the opening. The mirror-dancer was sticking close to Isabel Ruesta, and since the infanzones were sharing soldiers that meant… The thief moved towards his medicine cabinet. While mantics kept slithering down and fighting sounded above, he discreetly grabbed a small vial from the upper right compartment and felt out the lining of the door.

There were long needles, just like he’d learned in Alvareno’s Dosages, and he palmed one.

A look told him that Beatris was on her way up with her mistress and that Yong was fine – though visibly drunk, he was reloading his pistol without fumbling – so there was no need to stick his neck out. Better to wait for his moment, and until then take the opportunity he’d been handed. That crone Celipa had promised to see him beaten if he got into the crates, but now one was open and no one likely to be paying attention if he had a look at what was inside the others. Even as he uncorked the vial he’d taken and dipped the needle in the brown, viscous Spinster’s Milk within he snuck into the back of the hold. The vial was tucked away carefully, as was the needle, and he turned his attention to the mystery.

He’d been thrown into seeds earlier, but prying open other crates showed him the rest of the goods. At least two full of muskets, powder and swords, another of trinkets, but there was a lot of food. Some was military rations but also dried meats and a large amount of those cheap seeds, the kind that didn’t come from Glare-crops and so ended up used only to feed poor men and darklings. What does the Watch garrison on the island need with so much food? Something to keep in mind, though he best end this before he was caught. Leaving the cover of the crates, Tristan returned to find the tail end of a fight. Most the travellers had gone up like the infanzones, leaving only a handful behind to hold the stairs as mantics kept slithering in through the hole in the ceiling.

“Tristan,” Inyoni called out. “Hurry, we’re closing the door.”

Clutching his knife tightly, the thief tiptoed around the pack of scavengers being kept at bay by swords and a musket fixed with a bayonet. The noise caught their attention, and unlike the others he’d not earned their fear by piling up a few corpses: they came at him hard. Waddling forward with deceptive quickness the mantics moved to cut him off as he broke into a run, and though he leapt over the first that tried to bite his leg he was caught after he landed. Claws ripped into his trousers and he hissed in pain, slashing at the creature’s eyes. It howled in pain as he ripped through flesh, releasing him just fast enough he was able to run to the bottom of the stairs before the rest could do more than nip at his heels.

“See, I told you he was too slippery to die,” Inyoni drawled, idly slashing away at the mantics.

It held them back, Tristan saw. It wouldn’t have earlier, when the Saint had been there and they were gone entirely rabid. Now they were capable of fear again.

“Too slippery to fight, too,” Recardo grunted.

That got him contemptuous look from the remaining two, Inyoni’s nephew and the acne-ridden noblewoman from Asphodel. Best to nip that in the bud, he still had a use for a decent reputation.

“I was looking to see if the Saint left anything behind,” he lied. “She looks like a spider, so I was concerned of eggs.”

Ah, and away went the contempt.

“Shit,” Inyoni’s nephew quietly said. “Were there any?”

“Couldn’t find some, but I can’t be sure. I didn’t want to risk touching the webbing,” Tristan said, feigning reluctance at the ‘confession’.

“That was wise of you,” the Asphodel noble reassured him. “Nothing come of a Saint is harmless.”

“We can all pat ourselves on the back later,” Recardo cut in. “Let’s close this damn door and bar it shut, we’ve wasted long enough.”

Tristan smoothed away his smile. He’d known the Ruesta soldier would be there. See, every other infanzon would have a sword hand already with them. Cozme for the Cerdan brothers, Sanale for the Villazur and finally the Pereduri for Isabel Ruesta. Recardo was bound to be the one they left behind, and they had to leave someone behind so it wasn’t too obvious they’d abandoned everyone the moment danger arrived. Reputation and honour, yes? So now he only needed to play his part. How fortunate that Recardo was such a prick he hadn’t even had to bait out an insult.

“They’ll attack when there’s fewer of us,” Tristan said. “Like scavengers always do. The last of us will have a fight on their hands.”

Inyoni nodded, about to speak up when Tristan sniffed. He painted offended pride on his face.

“Recardo and I can take the role, if he so doubts I can handle a knife,” the thief said.

There was no argument. None of the others would clamour for the place of danger, and Recardo couldn’t even begin to try wiggling out of this without withdrawing his careless insult from earlier. Which the man would not, because he was a prick. And so as the others began to withdraw up the stairs, Tristan palmed the long needle he had put away earlier. To be safe, he waited until the third time the mantics came after them. He half-slipped on the stairs, drawing the scavengers after him eagerly, and even as he scampered back up the stairs in the chaos he pricked the large man in the fat of the leg. Recardo yelped and glared down, but Tristan withdrew quick enough it looked like a mantic had been at fault.

The thief scampered up, the two of them keeping the creatures away as the others disappeared up the stairs one by one. Tristan waited. Spinster’s Milk was an extract from a breed of lemures commonly known as Caotl’s Spinsters, horse-sized scorpions that’d earned the sobriquet because their venom was not mortal. As if needy spinsters, the beasts instead paralyzed their prey so they could eat them alive bite by bite. So Recardo did not die, as that would have been much too suspicious. Instead he slowed, limbs growing numb, and then made a mistake. When time came to avoid a snap of teeth the large soldier misjudged the length of steps and down Recardo went.

Tumbling down the stairs and into the pack of hungry mantics, who would conveniently eat the evidence.

“Hurry,” Inyoni hissed into his ear, dragging him by the shoulder. “He’s dead, kid, there’s no helping him.”

The thief made sure to protest once that he could still save his beloved comrade Recardo before allowing himself to be talked into abandoning him. He was not an amateur, so he did not smile as the door closed behind him.

One, Tristan Abrascal counted.

# Chapter 6

Teeth shattered most satisfyingly under her boot, the mantic whimpering as it fled. Angharad added a flourish to her wrist purely for effect, spearing the spirit from behind and nailing it to the deck before setting a fang-strewn boot on its head and ripping her saber clear. She flicked the ichor off the blade, eyes scanning the lower deck for enemies. Her comrade-in-arms did the same from her left, his own sword slick with black blood.

“We’re past the worst of it,” Cozme Aflor decided. “The gun ports are closed.”

How the scavengers had managed to get the cannon holes open in the first place was a mystery, though not one it was her duty to solve. She would settle for gladness at the mantics no longer crawling through them like a tide of vermin. Though the fighting was still hard above, where the Saint had fled, it seemed that the lower deck was near swept clean. The last stragglers from the hold had barricaded the door and now the same blackcloaks that’d stormed the deck to close the ports were gathering around the hole in the floor to take shots with their muskets.

It wouldn’t be enough to clear the numbers that’d gathered down there, but it would thin the herd.

“And with few dead,” Angharad said. “I must admit to having underestimated watchmen.”

Even seasoned Malani crews would have panicked at the sheer number of spirits that’d climbed the ship, but the men and women of the Watch had responded with calm discipline. They’d formed into squads, put their back to a wall and swept forward with powder and steel.

“You’re not so bad yourself, Tredegar,” the older man grinned.

With his salt and pepper beard and roguish smile the Cerdan soldier might have set another woman’s heart aflutter but here he was very much barking up the wrong tree. He was a loyal retainer and skilled at arms, however, so Angharad refrained from rolling her eyes. He’d proved a good man by standing in the defence of others and that earned him consideration.

“My skills have not rusted,” she simply replied. “And yours are worthy of praise: we did not let a single one through.”

Through to where was made plain by her glance back, where the ship’s arsenal had been turned into a cutter’s room. The Bluebell’s surgeon – Angharad hoped she was no Liergan doctor, for those were known to be deadlier than the plague – was seeing to the wounded, her door guarded by only a pair of blackcloaks. More were unneeded, given the veritable phalanx of passengers that’d gathered to take up the duty as well. Near a dozen in all, protecting not only the wounded but also the cowardly: of the infanzones only Lady Ferranda had stayed out the surgeon’s workroom to fight.

Lady Isabel was to be forgiven, given that she was no trained fighter and capable enough to serve as the surgeon’s assistant besides, but the Cerdan brothers had shamed themselves by hiding. By the occasional looks of contempt thrown their way by their shipmates, it had done their reputation no favours. There are no true nobles in Sacramonte, Angharad reminded herself, trying to temper her own scorn. Long gone were the days of the Second Empire, with only the dust of greatness remaining. Besides, she would not let her growing interest in Lady Isabel unfairly sour her opinion of those courting her.

She was no longer a girl, to think that her every rival must be a sot or a devil.

“Good work all around,” Cozme affably agreed. “Now we just need to settle in and wait for the Watch to clear the upper deck.”

Shouts above punctuated the sentence, followed by musket shots. The fight there had been raging before the first mantic ever set foot in the hold and by the sound of it had yet to abate. Angharad paused at the man’s words, weighing the demands of honour. She was a guest and so owed protection by her hosts, which did not demand she fight on behalf of the Watch. Yet she also owed them a personal debt for the way they had defended her at the docks when the Guardia came to take her, and it would be the height of ingratitude to stay her hand when she could return the courtesy.

The words exact are a sword, Anga, her father had once told her, so when wielding them you must hold on tight to the spirit of honour lest it slip your grasp. She had never loved her father’s lessons, for they were of men’s things – landholding and intrigue, squabbles about estate boundaries and cattle drinking rights – but he had been wise in his own way. Softer than Mother, who’d been born harsh and whittled sharp by a life out at sea, but in matters of honour she thought him wisest. Vesper would be a fairer place if more acted like him and Angharad would not dishonour the grave she’d dug him by betraying his teachings now.

“If there is a fight to be had, my blade will not shy from it,” she said, squaring her shoulders. “It has been a pleasure, Master Aflor.”

The older man’s face betrayed nothing of his thoughts as he nodded back politely. He did not offer to accompany her, nor had she expected him to. It would have been improper of him, as his life was not his own to risk: he had come here as the retainer of the Cerdan brothers, to put his flesh between peril and their own. Parting ways without further ado, Angharad tightened her grip around her sword and made for the stairs. Half a squad of blackcloaks was already there, the noblewoman’s earlier benefactor – Celipa, the one-armed sailor – leading them. The grizzled officer was in talks with a blond young man and Angharad caught the tail end of it without meaning to.

“-rave of you, but that thing’ll chew you up,” Celipa said. “Best you just stay out of the way. The captain will make his move soon.”

“I am not entirely helpless, tia,” the young man replied. “Besides, aid appears in great need.”

“Having a contract doesn’t make you a fucking god, boy,” Celipa retorted. “It makes you meat with a fancy trick.”

“Then let him come with me,” Angharad cut in as she approached. “I assure you, my lady, I am far helpless.”

The grizzled woman turned on her a gimlet eye.

“I already told you I’m not a godfucking lady, girl,” Celipa grunted, then sighed. “But I know that stubborn look on your face. Bloody Tredegars.”

She muttered something about blackpowder and ramming under her breath, then glared at them half-heartedly before stomping up the stairs. Angharad smoothed away a smile, having been reminded of the old sea dogs her mother liked to keep around. However loud the bark, they were never quite as dour as they liked to pretend. Turning to the man, she looked him up for a weapon – a short hatchet, touched by ichor in a way betraying use – even as she offered her hand.

“Lady Angharad Tredegar,” she introduced herself.

Introductions were in order if they were to fight side by side.

“Brun of Sacromonte,” the man replied, shaking it.

He had a common look about him, Angharad thought, but there was a steadiness to his bearing that was calming. His grip was firm, a sign of good character.

“Hurry up, you two,” Celipa called out.

The man’s lips twitched, a sentiment she fully returned, and they passed the rest of the watchmen to join Celipa and another where they were kneeling near the top of the stairs. It was not, however, a blackcloak that waited there. A long musket laid along the line of the floor, the mysterious stranger that’d approached Angharad earlier keeping her silver eyes on the ruckus above. From where she stood Angharad could see little more than the dark sky and the flashing lights of lanterns but the woman, Song, was positioned to see it all.

“She’s taken another two shots and whatever the captain’s doing to the sea seems to be working,” Song announced without ever looking away. “She’ll scuttle back up the mast soon so we should run out on my mark.”

“The two of you best listen to her,” Celipa turned to say. “It’ll do wonders for your lifespan.”

“You will be joining the fray as well, then?” Angharad asked, looking past her.

Song nodded.

“We need to put the Saint down as quickly as possible,” she said. “The longer she’s about the higher the chances she tears up sails.”

For the daughter of a famous explorer Angharad admittedly knew shamefully little about seafaring, but she knew enough to predict what might happen to a sailing ship bereft of sails.

“Get ready,” Song murmured.

Angharad tensed, legs coiling.

“Now.”

The three of them ran out onto the deck, right into Hell’s bastard cousin. A sweep of twenty blackcloaks had holed up in the Bluebell’s forecastle, muskets out and scything through anything that approached, but the remainder of the deck was bloody chaos. Strands of some sort of oily webbing were crisscrossing the length of the floor, some even hanging from the masts, while mantics threw themselves at a squad of blackcloaks with blind fury. They must have been chased out of the aftercastle, which had been ripped apart, and now the corpses of scavengers and sailors were messily strewn across the deck. Blackpowder clouds billowed thick as claw and blade clashed half-blind in the shivering lantern light, spirits and men furiously slashing at each other.

“SAINT UP THE MAST!”

Angharad saw no trace of the rampaging spirit they were being warned about, or indeed of much of anything at all. It was like stepping into an angry beehive.

“Don’t walk on the webbing,” Song shouted into the din. “It attracts them.”

“To the forecastle,” Angharad shouted back. “We can plan from there.”

“I’ll take the front,” Brun volunteered.

The noblewoman blinked at the courageous offer – there was no telling what lay on the other side of the powder smoke – and before she could answer the man was moving. They could do little but follow, hurrying as much as they could without stepping onto webbing. There were snarls from the side of she ship, a pair of mantic leaping over the railing. Brun’s hatchet split one’s head open before it could even bring up its claws, the butt of Song’s musket catching the other in the flank and smashing it down onto the deck. The Tianxi reached for the sword at her side but Angharad move quicker. A calm thrust through the dazed spirit’s soft skull finished it.

“We need to keep moving,” Song said, but not before offering a nod of thanks.

They’d caught the attention of the musketmen on the forecastle, enough that when they emerged from a choking cloud of powder a few shots were sent their way to clear their path. Angharad cursed as claws ripped at the back of her boots and scratched her heel, kicking at the spirit’s face until its eyes popped wetly. A pair of blackcloaks even came their way swords in hand, a gaunt man she recalled having seen in the hold accompanying them, and the three cleared their way through a pack of snapping mantics to join them.

“No,” Song suddenly shouted. “Galatas, your-”

There was an unearthly screech from above as Angharad’s eyes went to the gaunt man, seeing a moment too late what Song had noticed: the edge of his left foot was touching webbing. Half a hundred mantics turned their way in the moment that followed, though it was the whip-fast shape that landed on the deck that made Angharad’s breath catch in her throat. She’d not had a good look at the Saint before, when it fled up, but now she beheld the full horror in trembling lantern light. A girl’s body with nine burst-out spindly legs, the torso a nightmare of melded flesh and a once-human head now marred by huge wet eyes. Ribs peeked out of her flesh, webbing leaking out of them, and Angharad almost retched at the sight.

There was a reason the Sleeping God’s diviners taught that spirits and men should never share a single flesh.

“Run,” Song hissed.

Shots sounded, but too slowly. Before the powder blew the Saint had already impaled one of the blackcloaks and thrown aside the other like a sack of radishes, the fool who’d touched the webbing tripping as he tried to hurry backwards. Two musket shots tore through the Saint’s torso, tearing bloody holes, but she just shook off the blackcloak she’d impaled and casually ripped through the other one’s shoulder.

“Salt munitions,” a voice called out from the forecastle.

The Glare-drenched salt, Angharad knew, was as poison to most spirits. But the spirit was already moving, ready to scuttle back into the smoke and dark to ready for the snatching of more lives, and so she made her decision. Honour had its demands. She grabbed Song’s shoulder before the other woman could run.

“Get the wounded to the forecastle,” she ordered. “Have Brun help.”

“What are you-”

Angharad did not look back, striding out saber in hand. The Saint looked about to finish the blackcloak with the stomach wound, so the Pereduri calmly stepped on the strand of webbing before her. The Saint paused, neck twisting sharply to look back, and Angharad felt her stomach drop. Death, she had courted death, and now it was coming on blood-drenched legs to take her. Her body moved by rote, back straightening as the flat of her saber lightly tapped her left shoulder in a duellist’s salute. She glimpsed-

(The legs tore through her belly, turning to open her up)

-and stepped lightly to the right, pivoting even as the spirit screeched and slashing at its back. Leathery flesh parted under good Pereduri steel, splashing ichor even as the Saint lashed out blindly. Left leg, Angharad thought, catching the twitch early. A step back, leaning away, and the pointed tip passed half an inch below her chin. She threw her weight forward, pushing with the back leg, and struck with the strength of her entire body. The saber carved through the leg she’d aimed at, one of the four the Saint was standing on, and the maddened spirit tipped back. A glimpse-

(Over the shoulder, the tips of the legs going through Angharad’s eyes)

-and she slid down under the Saint as front legs twisted over the spirit’s shoulders, nailing the deck where she’d just stood. Landing in a crouch, she left a shallow cut on the spirit’s chest as she rose. From the corner of her eye she caught the twitch a moment before the Saint moved, pivoting to sweep from the right with three legs. Angharad simply stepped out of the swing, air whipping about her face, and she felt the dread drip out of her heartbeat by heartbeat. Eight legs left, the Saint coming at her relentlessly, and yet there was nothing to fear. She was back home, doing the Reprimand in the fighting yard.

It was a mad spirit coming at her from all angles instead of swinging stones, yet it was just the same. Watch, listen and move. Be as the wave, unhurried yet inexorable. A shot clipped the Saint’s shoulder and the spirit pivoted, but Angharad clicked her tongue and thrust shallowly into the creature’s side. For pain, for attention.

“Eyes on me,” she chided, and the spirit turned back with a skittering shriek.

A glimpse told her a mantic was to come upon her from behind, but also what would follow. Angharad moved to the side of a puncturing leg, pivoting and slashing at the Saint’s back even as the head of the scavenger come for her burst into gore: the blackcloaks on the forecastle were covering her back. The Saint bent back, wildly scrabbling forward with half a dozen legs, but the Pereduri took to the left and ducked under a lateral blow that would have shattered her ribcage. It was not just aiming poorly, she realized as the spirit struggled to turn while she slashed at her back legs, but not aiming at all. Like the stones swinging at the end of ropes that she had trained with back home, the trajectory of the Saint’s blows did not change after they began. She’s faster than her own senses can follow.

That made her predictable, Angharad thought with a wolfish smile, and she knew how to punish predictable.

Left, blindingly and blinded quick, the point ripping into the wood as Angharad stepped back. Right, as the twitch had told her, but a spirit that could not even control its own strength could hardly control the distance: the Pereduri dove forward, letting the Saint’s swing offer up two of the legs jutting out of her chest cleanly. With a heave and grunt, Angharad cut through the base of both as the spirit let out a deafening screech. She went wild, legs hacking at the front of her, but Angharad had already slipped to the left. Musket fire lit up the night, tearing smoking holes into the Saint’s back, and the spirit shuddered in pain. Salt shots, Angharad thought.

The Saint turned towards the forecastle, legs convulsing, and leapt. Only the gaunt man from earlier was there, elbowing watchmen aside as he traced something in the air and the billowing darkness of the Gloam formed into a Sign that merely glancing at had Angharad nauseous. At the apex of her leap, the Saint hit thin air as if it were a solid wall and let out a shrieking moan of surprise as she tumbled back down in a sprawl.

“FINISH IT!” a blackcloak shouted.

Musket fire bloomed and Angharad sprang towards the downed Saint, black-slicked blade raised high. Others came too, watchmen with pikes and swords as well Brun and a graceful Aztlan man wielding a spear. They hacked at the spirit’s legs while she flailed in pain from the musket fire pouring down from above, Angharad only joining the fray reluctantly. For all that she knew this was no true honour duel, the disparity in numbers still made the business feel disreputable. She thrust into the spirit’s back, dipping away from a flailing blow, and as she did noticed that webbing was trailing across the deck in thick rivulets.

Frowning, Angharad took another step back and realized that the oily trails were connecting with the earlier ones, spreading somehow, and that mantics were flocking to the web.

“Something’s wrong,” the noblewoman called out, “the Saint is-”

Her words were good as drowned out by the musket fire, but even that racket was chased out when the Saint’s death throes bloomed into a sky-piercing shriek. She staggered away from the sound, ears ringing, and watched in horror as the Saint’s wounds began to close and fresh legs burst out from the stumps. All over the ship mantics were melting into the webbing, flesh dissolving. The Saint rose, crushing a pair of blackcloaks with a casual swing as Angharad kicked a scavenger that’d snuck up to her side, but the gaunt man from earlier was back. Cheeks flush with colour he traced that same foul Sign between the spirit and the blackcloaks, only this when the Saint struck there was a crack.

A scream, then the Sign shattered and Angharad saw the man’s forearm turn into blackened pulp.

“No,” the Pereduri shouted, seeing their victory turn to ash.

She glimpsed-

(Sweeping her legs)

-and leapt above a swing, just in time for the edge of a blow to catch her shoulder and smash her back down in a spinning crash. She saw it coming then, too quick for a glimpse to help at all, the two legs coming down to nail her belly to the deck. Only there was a musket shot and the very tip of a leg blew as it came down, the stump smacking into the other and nudging it just to the side of Angharad’s ribs. It tore through her freshly mended coat instead, the Pereduri catching sight of a pleased smile under silver eyes before she hurried to rip her way free. Song had saved her life, somehow landing that preposterous shot.

She would not waste the chance she’d been given, the noblewoman swore, and was gritting her teeth to throw herself back into the melee when suddenly a door burst open. The room under the forecastle, Angharad saw, which had been locked and barred all this time. The captain’s quarters. Now it was wide open and a fat, dark-skinned man in a Watch cloak strode out, strands of Gloam following him like eager pups. The Saint struck at the captain but found the same Sign it had twice faced waiting. Only this time it was the spirit’s leg that was pulped when it hit thin air, and the captain calmly began to circle the Saint as he traced the same symbol anew.

Once, twice, thrice more the Saint broke herself on seemingly nothing until she was caught in a four-sided box.

“Grenades,” the captain ordered.

Angharad watched as half a dozen watchmen on the forecastle took out, lit and threw the Tianxi metal orbs over the lid of the invisible box the captain – a member of the Guild of Navigators, he had to be – had formed. Seconds later, before the Saint could think of trying to climb out, there was a blinding thunder and ichor sprayed all over transparent panes of nothing. The fat captain frowned, then spat to the side as the smoke dispersed and revealed nothing more than twitching shreds of meat.

“Salt her and box the remains,” he called out. “Peiling Society still has that bounty up on incomplete Saints.”

Angharad swallowed. Incomplete. That spirit had been incomplete? Sleeping God, putting down Saints wasn’t even considered the most perilous duty of the Watch. The blackcloaks fanned out from the forecastle in good order, a squad tending to the broken spirit’s remains, and as the noblewoman scanned the deck for dangers she saw that the fight was done. What mantics had not been devoured by the Saint were fleeing hastily, scuttling back into the dark waters. Few of the watchmen bothered to strike at them, and none with muskets. They were saving their powder, Angharad thought. And just like that, with nary a cheer from the victors, the battle was over.

Most looked punch-drunk at the suddenness of the end, though it did not prevent a few of the younger sailors from crowding her. The dark-skinned noble blinked, taken aback by the excited chatter. She had, it seemed, impressed through her duel with the Saint.

“It was like nothing I’ve seen before,” a boy that could not be older than fourteen said. “They’d be mad not to want you in the Skiritai!”

Angharad was only passingly familiar with the Circles, the seven societies within the Watch where only the most elite watchmen were inducted, but she had heard of the Skiritai Guild. ‘Militants’, its members were called, or even more bluntly ‘Swords’. They were the finest warriors of the Watch, which made the boy’s words a weighty compliment.

“I have had fine training, but I claim little experience with the horrors of the Old Night,” Angharad demurred.

“You must have a damned impressive contract,” a fair-haired woman her age said. “It was like you moved to dodge it before it even struck!”

Angharad’s lip thinned. Inquiring of contracts was impolite, and to the watchwoman’s honour she coughed in embarrassment. There might be a time where the Pereduri would be forced to speak of her contract with the Fisher, but even then she intended to hold back the truth and claim her gift was one of quickened reflexes. Lying sat ill with her but she had little choice. Foretelling contracts were strictly forbidden in the Kingdom of Malan, the High Queen’s decree punishing them by death, and one day Angharad must return home to take vengeance. The secret must keep, however dishonourable the keeping of it.

She was saved from the need to answer by the arrival of comrades-in-arms, the young blackcloaks retreating to give them privacy. Brun of Sacromonte, steady soul that he had proved to be, came to her while wiping his hatchet clean of fresh ichor. He’d not shied from fighting. Song, her long dark hair held in a plaited braid, had slung her musket on her back. She was pristine, save for a smudge of grease on her chin. Angharad wasted no time in acknowledging the truth, offering the Tianxi a deep bow.

“I owe you my life,” the Pereduri said. “I am in your debt.”

“And we are all in yours,” Song replied, shaking her head. “If you had not held on against the Saint until Captain Sfiso arrived there would be a great many more corpses on the floor.”

Angharad disagreed, for her life had been saved in the specific while she had only helped in the general sense, but she would not make an argument of it. One’s honour lay in one’s hands, not the eyes of others. She would remember the debt and repay it regardless of what Song might say.

“You have my gratitude nonetheless,” Angharad said. “I am only grieved the captain could not come sooner.”

She let an unspoken question hang there, which Brun caught easily enough. The Sacromontan smiled.

“I asked the same,” he admitted. “They tell me Captain Sfiso came so late because he was seeing to the rest of the mantics.”

Angharad’s brow rose.

“He wove Signs around the ship, a ring of wind that kept more of them from climbing aboard,” Song said. “An impressive display. He must be a member in good standing of the Akelarre Guild.”

Though most called that Circle the Navigator’s Guild, its true name was the one Song had used. But its members, known as Navigators, were in some ways the most famous of the Watch so the parlance had stuck.

“He turned the tide as soon as he appeared,” Angharad acknowledged. “Watchmen are not to be trifled with.”

Though it would have been proper to continue with some casual talk, the noblewoman made her excuses not long after. She felt exhausted to the bone and her coat was half a ruin. Making her way below she offered Celipa a nod – returned – before heading to the arsenal, where the ship’s cutter was seeing to the worst of the wounded. Near the door Isabel was catching her breath, the leather apron she wore stained with blood from her time assisting the surgeon. The infanzona saw her coming and a pleased smile tugged at her lips.

“I hear you made something of a stir upstairs,” Isabel said. “Congratulations are in order.”

“I only did my duty,” Angharad said, debating whether or not to play up humility a bit.

Perhaps not. The dark-haired beauty seemed more taken by boldness than the opposite. A gentle touch on her arm, warm through her sweat-stained shirt, jolted Angharad straight out of her exhaustion.

“You’ve ruined your coat again,” Isabel laughed.

“A casualty of war,” she solemnly replied.

“I will have my maids mend it,” Isabel told her, a teasing glint lighting up those lovely green eyes. “Though if you keep making a habit of that, I’ll start wondering if it is all a way to keep me close.”

“Entirely for your protection, of course,” Angharad smirked.

“Protection, hmm?” Isabel mused. “Is that what they call it in Peredur?”

Angharad heartbeat quickened. This was the closest either had come to acknowledging her attraction, and that Isabel did not seem put off in the slightest – she’d even brought it up! – seemed promising indeed. She cleared her throat.

“It is my duty as a peer to teach our customs to all interested,” she smoothly replied. “It would be my very great pleasure to offer… lessons.”

Isabel’s lips twitched.

“I’ll consider it,” she airily replied.

Their moment was interrupted by hoarse scream from the arsenal, Isabel flinching at the loudness.

“I must return to Doctor Balbir’s side,” she said, laying her hand on Angharad’s arm again. “Be well.”

It was an effort not to lean into to the touch, but the noblewoman mastered herself and offered a dignified nod back instead. She watched Isabel disappear past the threshold, feeling giddy as a girl. How long had it been since she’d last been so taken with another? Too long. The unrelenting pursuit of assassins had drained the joy out of her life and it could only be a victory to claw some small piece of it back. In too great a vigour for her original intention of finding a corner to sleep in, Angharad instead strode the length of the lower deck. The Cerdan brothers were seated in a corner, pointedly alone save for their valet, but Lady Ferranda was speaking with a pair of Someshwari.

Angharad joined them for a short chat, exchanging introductions and compliments. The man of the pair, rather rounded in shape and lacking in muscle, was called Ishaan and of noble birth. The other, short and shapely, was named Shalini. They had come together.

“We’ve known each other since were kids,” Shalini said, smiling like one to whom smiles came easy and often. “I couldn’t let him wander off into adventure alone.”

“She’s a much better shot,” Ishaan admitted. “There were plenty who had an eye on her talents back home.”

He looked, Angharad thought, a little guilty at that.

“Serving some dusty old raj as a showpiece champion or going into the Watch with you,” Shalini said, rolling her eyes. “What a difficult choice that was, Isha.”

Angharad shared a glance with Lady Ferranda, the two amused by the obvious affection between the pair. Making gentle sport of them would have been a pleasant way to pass the time, but the Pereduri caught sight of two men towering over another across the deck and frowned. Two Aztlan, one a bear of a man with a broken nose and the other the graceful spear-wielder she’d glimpsed above, were flanking a dark-haired man standing by some sort of cabinet. Were they taking advantage of the Watch’s distraction to break hospitality?  Making her excuses with the others, Angharad strode over briskly. All three turned to her.

“Good evening,” the noblewoman flatly said. “Does there happen to be some trouble?”

The big man scowled at her.

“Fuck off, Malani,” he said. “We’re just-”

“Be polite to our friend here, Ocotlan,” the other Aztlan interrupted. “Good evening, Lady Tredegar.”

“And to you,” Angharad reluctantly replied.

The big man had not liked being interrupted but he did not argue. He stood, Angharad thought, as if he were wary of his younger companion.

“Tupoc Xical,” the pale eyed Aztlan introduced himself, offering a hand. “Formerly of the Leopard Society.”

The noblewoman shook it, manners demanding as much, but her eyes sought out the dark-haired loner. He had the Sacromontan look about him, his scruffy dark hair and tan skin paired with deep grey eyes. He was also rather disheveled and very obviously of common birth. He met her gaze with mild curiosity and little else.

“Tristan,” he introduced himself. “A pleasure, my lady.”

“Shared,” Angharad replied, more politely than truthfully. “Am I to understand there is no argument between you gentlemen?”

“None at all,” Tupoc smiled. “I was only discussing a book with Tristan here. We seem to share an appreciation for Alvareno’s Dosages.”

“Indeed?” Angharad pressed, suspicious.

There was something familiar about the Aztlan’s polite manner.

“Master Tupoc was requesting medicine for a friend,” Tristan added. “It is my pleasure to help the brave souls that fought above.”

Suspicion lingered but the Sacromontan looked to be speaking honestly. The dark-haired man knelt to open his cabinet, revealing some sort of intricate medicine box within. Taking out two small vials, one half-full and the other empty, he palmed a fat syringe and began to extract from the full.

“You’ll need to dilute it with water,” he informed Tupoc, “else your friend Leander will fall into stupor. Two measures, preferably.”

The Aztlan nodded.

“Leander fought with us earlier,” the pale-eyed man told Angharad. “His arm was wounded when his Sign was broken by the Saint.”

Galatas, Angharad deduced, must have been the gaunt man’s surname.

“Is he not in the doctor’s care?” she asked, surprised.

“The doctor won’t be following us on the island, Malani,” the big man grunted. “Do you think the arm’s going to grow back?”

The Aztlan was leering at her most unpleasantly but she must admit he had a point.

“The stump will be tended to and cleaned, but something will be needed for the pain when we journey across the island,” Tupoc said. “You have my thanks, Tristan.”

The grey-eyed man smiled widely and happily. What a kind soul, Angharad thought. He must be a physician’s apprentice to take such joy in helping others. He did have a meticulous air to the way he moved, as if measuring every gesture.

“The honour is mine, Master Tupoc,” the Sacromontan replied, then rose to his feet.

His clothes, though clean, were shabby. The edge of his shirt was touched with ichor, a sigh he’d not been helpless in the fight.

“I should go see if the surgeon’s stocks are running low with anything,” Tristan said. “With so many wounded it is a distinct possibility.”

“Praiseworthy,” Angharad replied, impressed.

“Indeed,” Tupoc smilingly agreed.

The grey-eyed man took his leave, taking his medicine cabinet with him, and Angharad’s eyes turned to the lingering pair of Aztlans. As she had suspected, they still had business with her. One of them, anyway. The large man with the broken nose and the garish tattoos she dismissed, for all the muscle in the world would not change that he held himself with fear of Tupoc Xical. Said man, she realized after taking a longer look, seemed somehow… unnatural. His skin was without a single blemish, his face and limbs perfectly proportioned. It was as if some Tianxi artist had drawn a man rather than anything born of a woman’s womb. Yet it was the eyes that unsettled her most, pale things that they were.

“I am impressed,” Tupoc plainly said, “by the way you handled the Saint.”

“I could not have slain her without aid,” Angharad replied.

“Neither could most on this ship, blackcloaks or not,” Tupoc said. “It does not matter. The fight let me take the measure of you, Lady Tredegar, and I am pleased with what I saw.”

The noblewoman did not smile, did not thank him or answer at all. She recalled, now, why Tupoc’s pleasant demeanor felt familiar. She had known a girl, once, whose father had been a lord of the court at the feet of the High Queen. He had been smiling and polite and the soul of courtesy, the sole instance Angharad met him, yet somehow she had known that his smile would not waver even if he had to order the death of everyone in the room. Tupoc was the same, measuring those around him for usefulness and dismissing those that were not. Cold eyes, cold blood, Angharad thought. She knew a snake when she saw one and Tupoc Xical was only biding his time until the bite.

“I have been gathering comrades for the trials,” the Aztlan elaborated, impatient of her silence. “Leander fought in part to prove worthy of this company, which I intend to be without dead weight. I would be pleased to have you join our number, Lady Tredegar.”

“I thank you,” Angharad said, “but I have already found companions.”

“The infanzones have already lost one of their sworn swords,” Tupoc told her, “and they will find the trials more perilous than they think. I urge you to reconsider.”

Angharad met the man’s pale eyes, face a blank mask. She thought of the sound her blade had made, near the docks, when it had opened the redcloak’s throat. Of the wet, dying gurgle that’d hissed out. She held the death close in her mind and then smiled.

“I thank you,” Angharad evenly repeated, “but I have already found companions.”

Tupoc drew back half an inch before stopping himself. Pleasantness fell from his face in patches, like cheap cosmetics in sweat, and he gave her a long look.

“Unfortunate,” Tupoc Xical finally said. “I will not make this offer again.”

He inclined his head politely.

“We will meet again, Lady Tredegar.”

“Of that,” Angharad softly replied, “I have no doubt.”

She watched the pair leave, and when exhaustion began to creep back decided that she would have to find somewhere with her back to the wall to sleep. She had a feeling a knife might just sprout there otherwise.

—

The last leg of the trip to the island of Vieja Perdida, also known as the Dominion of Lost Things, was not restful.

The Watch crew cleared out the last of the mantics hiding in the hold before summary repairs were made and sails raised again. The Bluebell was limping where it had once run but they were assured by the captain that it would only make a difference of hours and they would not be greatly hampered in their taking of the trials. Angharad shared her misgivings about Tupoc Xical with her fellow nobles and found them taken seriously even by the Cerdan brothers, who had somewhat warmed to her since the fighting. They were not unaware that their reputation had sunk in the aftermath and were taking pains to be polite, though sometimes their unpleasantness still slipped out.

The infanzones sought out helpers of their own, among which Angharad was pleased to count Tristan. A physician, even a middling one, would be of great help on the island. She herself did not have much time of her own, as her actions against the Saint had lent her a degree of fame and her company was in high demand – which seemed to please Isabel, who often sat with her as she entertained other passengers and took a long walk with her on the deck. A watchman approached them at the end of the last, the sailor informing them that they were soon to be in sight of the Dominion.

“I must see to my affairs, then,” Isabel mused. “Angharad?”

“Go ahead,” she replied. “I want a look at this island before we touch the shore.”

“How quickly you leave me,” Isabel pouted, but it was nothing but teasing.

The Pereduri leaned against the railing, her mended coat making the cool wind nothing but pleasant as she settled in to wait. Her solitude was not to last, however, as she was approached by another passenger. Another woman, Aztlan and no older than twenty. Pretty, Angharad thought, with full lips and dark eyes.

“You must be the woman of the hour,” she smiled, offering her hand. “I am Yaretzi.”

“Lady Angharad Tredegar,” she replied, taking it.

The other woman’s grip was firm and lingering.

“I could not resist introducing myself, after hearing so much of your valour against the Saint,” Yaretzi said.

The talk that followed was light and pleasant. Angharad had never been one to disdain the admiration of a beautiful woman, especially one whose eyes were appraising her so frankly, but she knew she must cut this short. Setting her cap at another taking the trials was already somewhat foolish, but indulging in a flirtation with a second? That was courting trouble. Besides, what if Isabel saw and misunderstood? No, best cut this short indeed. Angharad was fairly sure, from the way Yaretzi was staying so close and batting her eyes so coquettishly, that she was not misreading friendliness as interest.

“I am told we are soon to arrive at the Dominion,” Angharad slid into a lull of the conversation. “We should see to our affairs before then, I think.”

“Of course,” Yaretiz agreed. “We shall talk later, I think.”

The Aztlan woman smiled rather flirtatiously, offering a slight bow.

“Should circumstances allow,” Angharad mildly replied.

Her solitude was returned to her just in time, for it was moments later that she first caught sight of the Dominion of Lost Things. The island was startling large, and though its hulking dark shape was touched with but little light – specks that must be the Watch fortress and the docks – she could make out its silhouette. Lowlands leading up to a handful of slender mountains, thick woods peeking out on the sides. How long would it take to cross from one end to the other? At least a week, she thought. More intriguing were the hard angles she glimpsed jutting out of the plains and peaks, manmade structures. There must have been old ruins. Angharad stayed on the deck, eyes peeled on the island, until the Bluebell was close enough to signal the docks with lantern lights. Her fate awaited her on those shores and she would not fail to meet it.

—

The stench was heavy on the wind.

Before they even docked, before ropes were thrown and the cog secured in that ragged harbour, Angharad knew what it was she was smelling. But she fought it all the way, trying to wrestle the knowledge down so it would disappear in some dark corner and never be seen again. The first thing she saw as she followed the others out onto the docks was the fires. A dozen of them, large as could be and burning bright. The smoke was thick and cloying, rising in tall columns as blackcloaks fed the flames with logs and charcoal. No one came to greet them as they crept out, the group hesitating for the absence, and the Bluebell’s crew were of no help: they were busy unloading crates and had no time to spare for this sort of business.

“There should be others here,” Augusto Cerdan frowned. “We are the second ship and the smaller one. Has the first wave already gone ahead and begun the trial?”

They have, Angharad thought. Sleeping God, they have. She knew the smell, the memory enough for sweat to trickle down her back as she remembered the screams. The bright bonfire of everything and everyone she loved disappearing into smoke.

“We must ask,” Isabel firmly said.

Before anyone could protest she peeled ahead, maids trailing in her wake, and approached a bearded old man in a black cloak who was shovelling coal into a fire. She smiled sweetly at the watchman, curtsying as she gave her greetings. Amused, the blackcloak paused in his work.

“The captain’ll be here to speak to you in a bit,” he said. “Don’t you worry your pretty little heads.”

“That is good to know,” Isabel said. “But may I ask where those who came with the first ship have gone?”

The old blackcloak laughed, then pointed his shovel at the sprawl of fires.

“You’re looking at them, girl.”

And Angharad finally looked horror in the eye. Allowed her gaze to stray among the flames where she made out limbs, the twisted shapes of broken and mutilated bodies. Faintly she heard the echo of screams long gone silent as the ghost of Llanw Hall burned on the wind.

“It’s a bad year,” the blackcloak shrugged. “All forty died on the first day.”

# Chapter 7

People could be funny about death, Tristan thought.

Dozens died in Sacromonte’s gutters every day and no one batted an eye, but if you tossed forty bodies on pyres and made people look at them suddenly it was the greatest tragedy in the world. Watching Isabel Ruesta bawling her eyes out the thief held back from rolling his own. Her admirers were already flocking to offer her sweet words of consolation, though he noticed they looked shaken too. That was the thing with nobles: they’d lived such pretty lives it never really sunk in that they were always just one mistake away from dying. They thought they were important, that the world should somehow care, but Tristan knew better. Your life only ever really mattered to yourself.

“I think she might truly be grieving,” Fortuna said, peering over his shoulder.

He snorted.

“Sure she is,” he murmured. “Her chance to marry her rich cousin just went up in smoke.”

Literally. Maybe one of the blackcloaks would be nice enough to help her pick out the right column. Keeping the amusement off his face, he flicked a glance backwards when footsteps creaked on ash-strewn mud. Yong’s black hair, tousled by warm breeze, was absent-mindedly pressed aside as the older man approached with a grimace.

“Thought I was done smelling this after leaving Tianxia,” Yong said, then spat to the side.

It was a hellish sight, the thief thought, the burning red glow and thick smoke swirling around them. It was what he thought Pandemonium might look like, that great monstrous city of devils in the far east. All the evils in the world, kept sealed inside Hell’s capital by the arms of the Watch. It had all felt very far away, once, but not so now that he’d left Sacromonte for this strange shore. Shivering despite the heat, the thief spoke to fill the silence.

“So you’ve been in wars,” Tristan said.

“It’s Tianxia, boy,” Yong snorted. “There’s always a fucking war on.”

So the word went. The republics making up Tianxia were famous for their squabbles, be they mercantile or military. Only the rough business of driving out the Imperial Someshwar had ever succeeded at getting them to set aside their enmities for more than a season.

“Killed some folk, didn’t get killed back,” the Tianxi continued. “As good as career as a soldier gets.”

His hand, Tristan saw, was inching towards the flask of drink in his coat pocket. It stopped when he noticed the thief’s stare.

“Anyhow,” Yong brusquely said, “they’re burning the bodies naked. Means the equipment is still around here somewhere.”

Tristan inclined his head.

“I’ll see what I can do.”

He didn’t make promises and the former soldier didn’t ask for any. Neither was fool enough to think getting caught stealing from the Watch would end in anything but summary execution. The show of sorrow was coming to an end, besides, Isabel Ruesta sniffling as her admirers swore she would be safe and her maids wiped her cheeks with soft handkerchiefs. Tristan saw most of the others were still milling about uncertainly, waiting among the ashes of the dead for a welcome that had yet to arrive. There were only a few blackcloaks tending to the pyres and they cared little for talk, while no one had quite dared approach those standing near a set of storehouses further up the beach.

A few enterprising souls shook the surprise before the rest, though. Ju and Lan, who’d failed to secure a place in Tupoc Xical’s crew despite heavy courting, were looking around for something. Either the rest of the blackcloaks – Tristan counted only a dozen, way too few for an outpost this large – or the same potential loot Yong had sniffed out. They earned unfriendly looks from the watchmen standing guard when they tried to casually approach the storehouses, almost making the thief smile. They might have been rats of a finer coat than he, but to the Watch they were rats still. Counting that situation as in hand, he moved out through the smoke.

In passing he found Tupoc Xical and his little band standing unusually close to a pyre, hiding one of them from sight with their bodies. The Asphodel noble with the acne, Acanthe something or other. Tristan watched them carefully, trying to make out what they were doing, but did not dare linger when he was seen. The Aztlan had shaken him down for painkillers on the boat, having recognized the box Tristan had stolen from Alvareno’s Dosages. The implied threat of having it revealed that he was going around carrying a poisoner’s kit had been enough for Tristan to pay up, but the matter was not finished. People who twisted your arm for payment always came calling again.

That crew was too dangerous to tangle with for now, but who knew how the trials would go? Patience was the key to many a lock.

The thief edged around the fires, taking a longer look around as the rest of the people began spreading out in their impatience. The Watch’s foothold on the island was no great fortress, only a couple of long stone storehouses that must have served as both storage and dormitories. Old lamplights cast a dim glow all around, the dirty lanterns hanging off them burning cheap oil. There was a sloping watchtower past the storehouses that overlooked the bay, the muzzle of three cannons peeking out from its top, but aside from these there was little here but docks, pyres and a muddy beach.

The docks weren’t even much to talk about, just a stretch of half-rotten wood jutting out into the water. Only two ships the size of the Bluebell would have been able to dock at the same time and only one to unload. Sailors were now bringing out crates from the cog’s belly, moving them towards the storehouses, and it was plain there would not have been room for a second crew to do the same. Instinct nagging away at him, the thief drifted closer to have a look at the crates being moved – though not close enough to earn suspicion.

“We’ve seen that crate before,” Fortuna suddenly pointed out.

He knew exactly which one she meant. The same crate the poor girl who’d turned into a Saint had tossed him into when she came out swinging, spilling seeds everywhere. It’d only been roughly fixed, tarp nailed onto wood to prevent further spills, and so had a distinctive look. As far as he could tell most of the crates being taken out were from the same part of the hold, and that had him curious. The Watch was bringing out cheap seeds, the kind from plants not grown in Glare light and so carrying none of that light within them. None but darklings and the poor ate anything made of that unless they had a choice.

“It can’t be meant for the blackcloaks,” he muttered. “There’s no natural Glare on the island, only the lights they brought. They should be eating only proper food to stave off Gloam sickness, not this shit.”

“They took out those boxes full of trinkets too,” Fortuna noted.

And yet, as far as he could tell, none of the crates that’d held muskets, blackpowder or military rations. This place was not, he deduced, truly the seat of the Watch garrison on the island. Only an outpost used to herd those who took the yearly trials. That and one more thing. His thoughts were interrupted by another’s approach, and there was no mistaking whose: Sarai, clad in the grey dress and veils that hid her from head to toe, was unlike anyone else come out of the Bluebell. Tristan did not move away when she came to stand by his side, as their last trade had been profitable to both. He was not averse to continuing the relation.

“I believe you’re the only other to have come looking at the crates,” Sarai said. “Those smiling twins came close, but only looking for grave goods.”

The thief snorted.

“No point in that,” he told her. “Either the blackcloaks will let us help ourselves openly or now’s the worst time to be trying.”

If there was anything he and Yong decided they absolutely needed, he’d wait until there were fewer people around to steal it.

“Practical,” Sarai approved. “But what has you looking at the crates?”

He hummed, not turning to meet the copper mask around her eyes. It would give him nothing.

“What has you doing the same?” Tristan retorted.

“We’ve been told that Captain Crestina’s only a few minutes out,” Sarai easily said. “I came to warn you.”

Half a lie. She was counting the crates too, the thief had noticed. But it’d been useful what she said, so he gave a little too.

“This isn’t where the real Watch garrison is posted,” he said. “Crates full of arms and rations are still in the cog. They must have a fort elsewhere on the coast the Bluebell will be sailing for.”

It was hard to tell, with the veils, but he thought she might have smiled.

“The sailors chattered about a town called Three Pines back on the ship,” the othered shared. “This can’t be it, so we are in agreement.”

He nodded. The two of them stood there, counting the crates, for a long stretch of silence. Only when it became clear the sailors would take nothing else out of the cog was Sarai stirred to speak again.

“You must have figured out what this place is really about,” she finally said.

Tristan weighed his options. If she was counting, then so had she. There was not much to lose by speaking his mind.

“It’s a trade post,” the thief said. “Or something like it. Crates of black seeds and trinkets? There’s darklings here on the island and the Watch trades with them.”

“Trinkets,” Sarai slowly said, as if trying out the word. “Yes, that is a good way to call them. Glass and mirrors and kettles.”

He glanced her way, but there was no reading the woman beneath the veils.

“The Malani love to use trinkets up north,” she said. “They bribe lowland kings with them to win rights to slaves and copper. They’ll trade the kings everything out of Malan, really, save for the one thing the blackcloaks aren’t trading here either.”

“Muskets,” Tristan quietly said.

“That is so,” Sarai agreed, the faintest touch of a strange accent touching her voice, then turned his way. “I counted fourteen crates. You?”

“The same.”

“Then we know there are hundreds. Likely more than a thousand.”

Tristan grimly nodded. Seeds didn’t keep forever and, if fourteen crates of them were to be sown soon, then there must be enough darklings on the island to sow them. That was troubling, even though Tristan was no sneering Redeemer to believe all darklings at best a step removed from beasts. He’d rubbed elbows with their kind in the worst of the city’s slums, near the old mines where many dwelled. Tristan had found them a strange folk, but not so different from other men. Yet here the Watch was taking great care to keep muskets out of their hands and that was a telling thing.

“Has to be cults,” the thief said. “The old stories say that the island’s called the Dominion of Lost Things because the Watch throws away all sorts of old evils on these shores to be lost forever.”

“Cults would be a greater concern than simple lemures,” Sarai replied. “They’ll go out of their way to hunt us.”

Darklings who worshipped the bloody-handed gods of the Old Night were rightly feared by all civilized peoples of Vesper, as their cults sought a great many things but blood was always one of them.

“There’s a reason only fools and the desperate take these trials,” Tristan said.

She turned to shoot him a look which, even under the veil, he could tell was amused.

“And which are you, Tristan?”

He offered her a winning smile.

“You underestimate me, Sarai,” he drawled. “I might lay claim to both.”

She cocked her head to the side.

“That act you put on is surprisingly charming,” Sarai said. “It must have taken you years to polish.”

Surprise stole the words out of his mouth. His belly clenched in discomfort as Fortuna guffawed, leaning against his shoulder.

“Oh, we should keep that one,” the goddess decided. “Make it happen, Tristan.”

He was saved from answering by a ruckus in the distance: as he’d been forewarned, Captain Crestina was returning. They parted without another word, Sarai’s last still hanging in the air between them, and he drifted through the columns of smoke. Yong joined him halfway, the two of them following the press of trial-takers gathering as the blackcloaks rode in. The watchmen numbered a dozen, all riding sure-footed Abrian ponies and armed to the teeth. Wrapped in the heavy back cloaks that’d earned the Watch its oldest sobriquet they carried muskets, sabers and paired pistols with powder gourds hanging off their saddles.

“They look ready to fight a war,” Yong muttered, and Tristan could only agree.

A rider guided her mount away from the rest, barking out an order that saw half the company heading towards the storehouses while she pulled down a black scarf to reveal the tanned features and curly hair of a born Sacromontan. Reining in her panting horse, she cast a look that was halfway to a glare at the crowd before spitting to the side. The infanzones wrinkled their noses as the sight almost as one. The thief, on the other hand, grew wary. He could almost smell the anger boiling under that still-calm façade.

“Welcome to the Dominion of Lost Things,” the blackcloak announced. “I am Captain Crestina Elvir, the officer appointed to command of this outpost by grace of the Conclave. You may refer to me as either captain or ma’am.”

Tristan knew little of the Watch’s workings, for the order delighted in secrecy, but the difference between the Conclave and the free companies was common knowledge. If the companies were the branches of the tree, largely independent armies and fleets roaming Vesper to take contracts as they would, then the Conclave was the trunk. It ruled the Watch’s fortresses, ran its tribunals and conducted its diplomacy. Captain Crestina, if she had been appointed by it, was not answerable to anyone else. It was a veiled warning to any noble who might think to make demands of her, Tristan figured. By the silence that followed her words it had duly been heard.

“You will have heard by now that the first wave of trial-takers met misfortune,” Captain Crestina said. “I can confirm that all forty of them are dead.”

No sobs followed, not even out of Ruesta, but a great deal of unease spread. Tristan shared in it.

“May I ask what happened to them, captain?” one of the infanzones called out.

Lady Villazur, he noted. Of the Sacromontan nobles, she most seemed to be taking the dangers seriously.

“They decided to set out early and were ambushed by cultists of the Red Eye about half a day from here,” the watchwoman plainly said. “Some would have made it, if the fighting hadn’t woken up an airavatan.”

That didn’t get much a reaction out of anyone except the Ramayans, who faces betrayed fear and surprise. Noticing the confusion of most the crowd, the captain elaborated.

“A heliodoran beast,” she said, and that got gasps.

Abuela had made him read several books on lares lemures, most of them about the creatures native to the shores of the Trebian Sea, but ‘heliodoran beasts’ had come up in one of the more fantastical works. More common in the Imperial Someshwar, Tristan recalled, they could grow large as houses if they were old enough. He’d never seen a drawing, but they were said to be horned creatures possessed of many eyes and great strength.

“It killed most everyone and wandered off after chewing on a few corpses,” Captain Crestina said. “The good news for you lot is that with a full belly it won’t be on the prowl for more. It might even have gone back to sleep by.”

“And the bad news?” Tupoc Xical asked.

“The Red Eye cult is all riled up, boy,” she replied. “They lost near a full warband and brought back no sacrifices to show for it. They’ll be out in force looking to make up for that. My men and I just cleared their scouts all the way to the High Road, but from here on out you’re on you own.”

Then she looked viciously amused.

“Of course, there’s now a graveyard’s worth of blood spilled on the road north,” Captain Crestina added. “So if I were you I’d first worry about the scavengers that will draw out.”

The brutal mixture of honesty and disregard hit the most fearful among them hard. Aines, the terrible gambler he’d met in passing, looked about to break down weeping and her husband was little better. The old woman with the spectacles, Vanesa, had a resigned look about her. Like she’d not expected to live through this in the first place and had just got that fate confirmed. Even a few of the recommended foreigners looked wary. Whatever good cheer had been won by the victory on the ship was returned to the aether. The Asphodel noble with acne cleared her throat loudly.

“We were told-”

“I don’t care what you were told,” Captain Crestina sharply interrupted. “I’ve lost half my command cleaning up the mess the first pack of idiots made and I’m not going to bleed the rest holding your hands. You have from me all you’ll get, inutil.”

She spat to the side again, eyes glittering with anger.

“You get the rules, you get to take from the supplies and then you’ll all be getting the fuck out of my outpost before the hour’s out.”

The blackcloak mastered her temper, lowering the voice that’d begun to rise with the end of her sentence.

“Lieutenant Sihle, take them through the rest,” she called out. “I have letters to write to the families of men who deserved better.”

A rider from the handful that had been standing behind her came forward, taking off a wide-brimmed hat to reveal a dark Malani face. The man smiled, lamplight glittering on a silver tooth as he did.

“Yes ma’am,” he agreed.

Captain Crestina rode away, face twisted in anger, and her lieutenant turned to the crowd with brisk mannerisms.

“There are three trials,” Lieutenant Sihle announced. “The first is Trial of Lines, which you are soon to begin. To find the others is simple: there is a road beginning half a mile ahead, and you simply need to follow it across the island.”

Through thick woods that could be seen in the distance, Tristan noted, and then tall mountains much further ahead. No doubt through cultist ambushes and hungry lemures as well.

“At the end of every trial, before the next, you will find sanctuaries marked by yellow lamps and entering them means you have succeeded,” the lieutenant continued, sounding almost bored. “Neither beasts nor cultists will do you harm within these sanctuaries, and there officers will offer you the opportunity to end your candidature.”

He paused.

“Should you choose this, you will enter the protection of the Watch and be escorted to our garrison, where you will await the end of the trials before sailing back to Sacromonte.”

This was not news, not exactly, though Tristan had not known the practical details. Infanzones always quit after the second trial, lest they win the ‘reward’ of being inducted into an order that required one to renounce their titles. This was a proving ground for them, not a vocation’s choosing.

“Apologies, sir,” Angharad Tredegar spoke up, “but you have forgot to mention the rules.”

The lieutenant frowned at her.

“What rules?”

She blinked.

“Surely there must be rules of conduct between us,” the Pereduri said. “Lest the trial descend into squabbles and backbiting.”

Tristan swallowed his smile. Gods. She hadn’t quite got what this first trial was about, had she? It wasn’t called the Trial of the Lines because the road ahead was straight. It was about the lines you were willing to cross to survive. The thief couldn’t muster up resentment for it, though, or even much mockery. Tredegar seemed to largely mean well, much as when she had come to ‘save’ him from Tupoc Xical. She was of that particular breed of noble who thought they benevolent saviours, never mind that they usually had no idea what the people they were trying to help wanted or needed.

Still, she was cut of better cloth than the like of the Cerdans so he took no joy from Lieutenant Sihle laughing in her face.

“This isn’t that kind of a place, girl,” the watchman said. “You’re not allowed to kill each other here or inside the sanctuaries, but beyond that?”

The lieutenant shrugged.

“Survival is the rule. The rest isn’t the Watch’s concern.”

Tredegar took it better than he’d expected, shutting her mouth and slowly nodding. Maybe not as soft as I thought, Tristan considered. He supposed that becoming a ‘mirror-dancer’ must beat some squeamishness out of you, if it was actually anything like what Sarai had described. Considering that the sailors – many of them veteran watchmen – had sounded awestruck when describing her scrap with the Saint, Tristan was inclined to believe it. Someone asked about the supplies Captain Crestina had mentioned and the lieutenant agreed to lead them to the goods without much prodding. What they found when led there was better than he’d expected, finally an upside.

There were three crates of miner’s rations, dried meat and sourdough bread with nuts and berries, all neatly wrapped in packs. Besides them were crates of cheap waterskins, bedrolls, lanterns and fire-starters. All were invited to help themselves, courtesy of the Watch, though many refrained as they had better equipment already. Tristan did not, but because others did he felt comfortable going straight to the three sprawling piles besides the crates with no fear of being left without supplies. There the watchmen had dumped the equipment of the deceased, separating them into three broad categories: weapons, clothes and the rest.

Lieutenant Sihle left them to it after a last reminder they were to be gone by the end of the hour.

A semblance of order formed around the crates, begun by Angharad Tredegar lining up behind a surprised Vanesa. Those that would have elbowed the old woman aside without a second thought did not dare to pick a fight with the Pereduri, ensuring temporary civility as others lined up, but Tristan spared the affair no more than a glance. His fellow rats were coming for the grave goods and there would be no courtesy to be had there. Ju and Lan were already sniffing around the weapons, Ocotlan the legbreaker elbowing one of the twins aside to grab a long-hafted axe no one else would have been able to use anyhow.

Tristan grabbed a leather tricorn in the Malani style out of the clothes pile and set it on his head before joining the fray, just as Brun and the married pair – Aines and Felis – began looking too. Most of it was useless to him, swords he did not know how to use or hunting spears, but he grabbed a hunting knife to serve should his own blade break. The dozen muskets lined up were useless to him as well, but the pistols warranted a second look. The thief had little training with the weapons, for Abuela considered them loud and imprecise, but he knew basics. And from close enough a pistol was hard to miss with.

Best to have it and not need it than the other way around, he decided.

He grabbed a wooden powder flask from the pile and began rifling through the pile of pistols, stilling when he came across a familiar sight. As far as arms went it straddled the line between decorative and practical, engraved with wolves chasing each other’s tails while a tassel hung off the bottom bearing an incrusted red gem. The cold metal of the barrel, though, was functional and without frills. Tristan’s mother had owned a pistol much like this, once, though her own Raseni relic had preferred foxes to wolves. Breaking out of his stupor, he – Ju’s fingers closed around the pistol and she shot him a sly blue grin.

“Too slow, rat,” she chided, and flicked a finger against the gem.

It rang prettily.

“Not too pure a ruby, but still worth a tidy sum,” Ju decided.

She had no idea what the relic was really worth, then. Tristan could have told her he’d seen it first, but the claim would have meant nothing to either of them so he didn’t bother.

“Give it here,” he said instead.

The Meng girl frowned, reading his face and then taking half a step back.

“Help yourself to another,” Ju said. “Plenty left.”

Tristan’s hand slid towards the blackjack at his side, not quite subtly enough for her to fail noticing it.

“Last warning,” the thief said.

From the corner of his eye he saw they’d drawn some attention, so it was too late for either of them to back out. Whoever did would be marked as easy meat for anyone that felt like throwing their weight around. Ju flicked a glance behind him, seeing something that strengthened her resolve, and sneered.

“You wouldn’t dar-”

He aimed the blow for the side of her mouth, hard enough it’d hurt but not knock teeth out. Ju yelped in pain as she stumbled onto the ground, cradling her cheek, and Tristan pivoted out of the way. He moved out of the path of the swing he’d expected, seeing his attacker’s face: Lan had grabbed a musket and tried to smash it into his back like a mace, but she was no trained scrapper and it’d gone well wide. The thief took a quick step forward, resting the side of the blackjack’s leather strap against her neck before she could recover. Lan went still.

“From here on out I go for crippling blows,” Tristan evenly said. “Ju, give me the pistol.”

The spectacle drew scavengers. Broken-nosed Ocotlan, interest caught by the violence, approached with an expectant air. He was looking at the relic pistol as well, likely wondering what was worth a scrap there and whether he should try his hand at taking it. Tristan schooled his face not to reveal he’d seen Yong silently moved behind the big man, a hand on the hilt of his sword. Brun stepped close as well, eyes watching them all closely with that perennial calm smile. That one worried him more than the big Aztlan, if only because he was much harder to read.

“They won’t let you get away with it,” Lan said, but her voice was shaking.

Tristan’s jaw clenched. He’d already given as many warnings as he cared to: offer too many of those and people stopped taking you seriously. His arm tensed as he drew back for another blow, but the sisters gave first. Ju threw the pistol at his ankles, just strong enough for it to sting.

“There,” she spat. “Choke on it.”

He gave Lan a warning look and the other sister took a step back, grimacing, as he bent to pick up the relic. His eyes were already moving on to Ocotlan, who looked like he’d come to a decision. That nasty grin heralded nothing good but the big man was too late. Angharad Tredegar, wearing that coat ever in need of mending, strode boldly onto the scene and Tristan almost smiled because it’d been about time. Now that the scavengers had clawed at each other, their benevolent saviour would naturally come to restore order.

“What is going on here?” the dark-skinned noble demanded.

And there went Ocotlan’s smile. He would be under orders by Tupoc to avoid tangling with the mirror-dancer, Tristan figured. A practical sort of bastard, Tupoc Xical. Unfortunately not the kind of man who could be counted on to get himself killed on his own.

“An argument over goods,” Tristan said. “It has ended.”

Tredegar glanced at the blackjack still in his hand with surprise and some distaste. Ju had, of course, elected to remain on the ground and was now cradling her cheek like he’d struck her twice as hard as he actually had. Betting on the Pereduri getting the relic back for her, was she? Unfortunately for her, Tristan knew exactly how to deal with the likes of Angharad Tredegar. Having given his answer, he turned and walked away. Not in another direction, for that would have smacked of retreat, but instead past the noblewoman. She was half expecting a confrontation, it was writ in her stance, but the thief instead said nothing and continued past her before she could recover from the surprise and try to interrogate him again.

Even if the twins went whining to her now, what would Tredegar do – shake him down for the pistol in front of everyone? That wasn’t the kind of person she thought she was. She’d stepped in to save someone, not serve as legbreaker for a pair of sisters who were more than a little bit suspicious. The Pereduri wouldn’t like it, but the matter was good as finished. The thief was aware he’d soured the first impression he had made on a dangerous woman and crossed another two, but he was still smiling as he moved towards the back of the line for the rations. Yong came to stand behind him to wait, as if by coincidence.

“So what was worth the mess?” the soldier asked, voice slightly slurred.

Drinking again. It hadn’t taken long. Tristan ripped the string keeping the tassel tied to the bottom of the relic, shoving it into his pocket after. Angling the pistol so that only he and Yong would see, he then pressed his thumb against one of the wolves. There was a slight click and panel popped open, revealing a small stone no larger than thumbnail. It gave a soft, pale glow that the thief allowed to be glimpsed for only a heartbeat before sliding the wolf panel closed again.

“Rhadamanthine quartz,” Yong whispered, startlement sobering him up in an instant.

Found only within the city-state of Rasen’s famous quarries, the precious stone was worth a fortune. Rhadamanthine quartz held the Glare as few other materials did, almost day to day: a year soaking in the light meant bout a year holding it. The piece in the relic pistol Mother had owned had gone inert, lessening its value – once it lost the first light for good, the stone was said to begin holding it less and less – but it had still been pawned for enough the two of them to live on it for years.

“No Gloam disease for us,” Tristan said, not hiding his satisfaction. “Even if the lights go out.”

Keeping it against their skin for a few hours a day would keep the sickness from coming upon them until the stone died. Raseni families considered the relics to be heirlooms, passing down from parents to children and treasuring them greatly. The rarity of their sale only made them more precious.

“Worth the enemies,” Yong agreed.

There was no more excitement as the trial-takers claimed their supplies, the mood somber now that Tristan’s actions had laid bare an ugly truth: survival was more important to everyone here than civility. That did not mean all were eager to go off on their own, though. If anything the corpses still burning on the pyres were a stark warning as to the risks of that approach. When a handful came together in conversation away from the rest, Tristan immediately saw the writing on the wall. Who they were spoke loud as to what would follow: Ferranda Villazur and Augusto Cerdan for the infanzones, Tupoc Xical for his own band and grizzled Inyoni for the two pairs of youngsters with her. Every group with clout had a voice there, to an evident purpose.

They all wanted to stick together for the early part of the Trial of Lines.

That it would happen was good as a foregone conclusion. Everyone wanted numbers until they were certain there was no Red Eye ambush waiting along the road or large roving packs of lemures. Once everyone was further in people would begin turning on each other again, but for now all would prefer safety over seeking an edge. Tristan dismissed the talks from his mind, seeking instead the company of the other ally he’d struck a bargain with. Both of Isabel Ruesta’s handmaidens had changed out of their dresses into more practical trousers and jackets for the walk ahead, Beatris’ were visibly shoddier than Briceida’s.

Tristan figured that, unlike the drapier’s daughter, his fellow rat had not had the coin to put on getting clothes she might never wear again tailored. She was also the one checking on the bags one last time before departure, Briceida instead attending to their mistress, but the thief was glad of that much. It was easier to approach her than if she were close to the infanzona, who Tredegar and the younger Cerdan were circling like bees would a flower. And largely for the same reasons, as far as Tristan could tell. He made no effort to hide his approach, and though he stopped well short of being in reaching distance of the bags Beatris still turned to glance at him. Brushing back dark hair, she scowled.

“That show tarred your reputation good,” Beatris informed him. “If not for your medicine cabinet, they might have thought twice about bringing you along.”

“But they haven’t changed their minds,” Tristan pressed.

She shook her head. Good. That had been his worry, that a miffed Tredegar would try to oust him. His bet had been that the Cerdans would oppose her out of pure dislike and it was good to see it had paid off.

“I have work,” Beatris told him. “I must get back to it.”

He pushed down a frown. She had never asked if he’d gotten Recardo killed and he’d not offered up the truth of it, but since that day she had kept a distance. She’d not turned on him, remaining friendly, but she knew he was dangerous now. Capable of killing and keeping it quiet. And so Beatris, sensibly enough, seemed to have decided he was someone best kept at arm’s length. Tristan would have preferred to keep on better terms, but if their relations were take a cooler tone he would adapt. Casting a quick look around to ensure no one was watching, he reached in his pocket for the jewel-incrusted tassel and tossed it at her.

Beatris fumbled the catch but picked it up from the floor quickly enough, surprise painted on her face. She turned a questioning look on him.

“I have no use for it where I’m headed,” Tristan shrugged.

Whether that be the grave or the Watch, a small ruby would do him no good. For her, however, it might just represent a turning point in her life. With the coin pawning this would earn her, it was no longer certain she must stay in the service of House Ruesta for the rest of her life. Beatris bit her lip before nodding, putting away the gem before anyone could see her taking it.

“This is a trade,” the thief reminded her. “I scratch your back…”

The dark-haired woman shook her head.

“I know how this goes,” she replied. “I’ll keep an ear out for anything of interest to you.”

The grey-eyed man dipped his head in thanks, troubling her no further. She still had work to do and it wasn’t like the nobles would deign to carry their own supplies. It took another quarter hour for the informal council to finish, but his prediction proved accurate. A pact was struck and protection offered for those who would obey some simple rules. All were to pitch in for the group’s protection as they marched, a roster would be made for keeping watch when camp was made and so long as one joined the company there would be no violence against each other. Only a fool would have refused the terms, so no one did.

They hurried after that, Captain Crestina’s demand they be gone by the hour’s turn not something anyone cared to test. Under the stares of the blackcloaks the thirty-one of them settled into a thick marching column, bristling with lamps, and a lumbering march forward began.

Behind them the lanterns of the Watch grew distant, darkness hemming them in from all sides, and the Trial of Lines began.

# Chapter 8

Lieutenant Sihle had said the road began half a mile ahead and that was where they found it.

Tristan was no tracker, not so far from dirty alleyways, but though the ancient paving stones were half-covered by dirt and dead leaves they were too large to be missed by anyone with eyes. The woods were light on either side but grew thicker swiftly, leaving the impression of a path cleared thoroughly long ago and since left for the forest to reclaim year by year. Most fighters banded at the front and the back of the column while those there were low expectations for – the two greyhairs, the twins, Ruesta and her maids – stood safely stashed in between as the company marched on.

Yong had been called to the front by virtue of having a musket and knowing how to use it while Tristan was ordered to the back by the Cerdan brothers’ unpleasant valet, Gascon. The richly mustachioed man had been open in his contempt, having a look about him the thief was not unfamiliar with. It cropped up sometimes in the personal servants of infanzones, those few who’d gotten so used to the taste of boot on their tongue they’d begun to think they were part of the sole. Contempt the thief cared nothing for, but his choice of company at the back of the column was unfortunate: he shared the guard with Tupoc Xical and his two Asphodel companions.

Leander Galatas was still nursing his wound from the Bluebell, the arm turned to pulp now a thoroughly bandaged stump, and kept to a sullen silence. The Asphodel Rectorate noble, whose full name Tristan learned to be Acanthe Phos, was a rather chattier fellow. She asked of his origins, which he remained vague about, and shared of hers freely. House Phos was, she told him, one whose fortunes had not done well as merchants began their rise. The lack of opportunities afforded to a seventh child from an impoverished house – one whose unfortunate acne made unlikely to marry rich – had seen her seek a career with the Watch.

“It’s all Tianxia’s fault, of course,” Acanthe told him, patting his arm in her enthusiasm. “Their traders rile up the commons, starting all this talk of turning Asphodel into a republic allied to the Ten. Absurd.”

He tended to agree. It would hardly be the first time the Tianxi helped overthrow the nobles of a city-state in the Trebian Sea, but one so close to Sacromonte? He had his doubts. Tianxia already had troubles enough at home without borrowing some from the City’s backyard. Still, he suspected that his own Republican sympathies would win him no friend here so Tristan steered the conversation into safer waters. Talk of Sarai, who yet feigned to be from the hated rival city-state of Rasen, was fertile ground.

“You can’t trust Raseni, Tristan,” Acanthe lectured him. “It is well known that they wear their veils to better hide the devils among their numbers. They frolic with their like in debauched rituals, hoping to gain dark powers.”

Having been just as reliably informed by a Raseni trader that Asphodelites were half-devils themselves, keeping hidden libraries of dark tomes used in unholy rituals to turn the winds against honest Raseni captains, the thief hid his amusement as best he could.

“Oh,” Tupoc mused, “I’m sure Tristan has nothing to fear from our Raseni, Lady Phos. He’s already beaten a woman today, why not another?”

The thief did not react. It was not the first time the Aztlan  tossed a barb his way, but giving him nothing in return saw him grow bored and cease. Having to take the needling again and again was exhausting, but he was dertemined not give Tupoc whatever it was he was after. Tristan let the conversation peter out again, saying nothing, and ignored Acanthe’s sympathetic look. She had yet to object, for while she might be enjoying their conversation it was Tupoc Xical she had thrown in her lot with. She’d not endanger that alliance for a nobody.

The thief kept to his own mind for a time, unsettled by the ring of darkness around them. In Sacromonte there was always light, however distant, but here there was nothing beyond the glow of the lanterns they carried. The Watch’s outpost by the shore was hidden by the tall trees and the stars above seemed so distant – as if even the ancient wonders of the Antediluvians were seen through a veil. He’d read that the islands of the Trebian Sea were among the most luminous of all Vesper, so how dark must the rest of the world be? He shivered at the thought.

The thief had no watch but bespectacled old Vanesa did, and when they halted word made its way down the column it had taken three hours and a half for them to reach the blood-soaked battlefield Captain Cristina had spoken of.

It was a great clearing that the road ran right through, an opening in the forest, or at least it had been. There was a gaping pit at the heart of it now, even the ancient paving stones shattered, and dried blood spread everywhere in wild streaks. They approached slowly and carefully, swords and muskets out – Tristan carefully loaded his pistol, cramming in the powder and ball – until the shivering lantern lights made out great footprints in the earth. Each was as large as a great pillar and rounded, digging deep enough to hint at the crushing weight behind the legs. It was with relief that Tristan saw the tracks heading east, deeper into the forest. But the captain’s warning proved prescient.

As they passed around the pit shapes darted out of the shadows cast by the broken grounds. Only a dozen, though the suddenness of the charge caused some startled screams. Shots rang out before Tristan could even see the beasts properly, five of them dead on the ground in an instant – that short Ramayan girl with the pistols downed two in the same breath. Half the remainder fled, the rest charging madly as they howled. They were lupines, Tristan saw, lemures with the look of great wolfhounds that grew bonelike stingers along their matted fur. Their teeth were too large and curved for dogs, or even wolves, and their eyes like pits of yellow sulphur.

The three that charged, for all their swiftness, ran into fine killers at the ready. Inyoni and Tredegar shot forward, blades flashing a beast’s head was hewn open and the other run right through. The third passed them, just in time for Ocotlan’s axe to nail to the ground. It went right through, like a hatchet for a melon, and pulp flew sickeningly.

Tristan spared them no more thought, though, as more lemures were circling the treeline behind him. Only a few shapes slinking along the line of light cast by the lanterns, but the sight of them was enough to have him clutching his pistol tightly. One ran out suddenly, and not thinking twice he lowered the pistol and pulled the trigger. The flintlock sparked but his wrist trembled and the shot went whizzing wide, the lupine darting back out of sight without ever have been in danger. Tupoc Xical snorted from behind him.

“Best stick to the blackjack, I think,” the Aztlan said.

Tristan hid his embarrassment by looking away, pretending to watch the woods.

“Not that these are worth fearing,” Tupoc continued. “Barely more than dogs.”

“Lupines prefer long hunts, Xical,” he replied, pleased to correct the other man. “They can smell a scent for several miles and have unnatural endurance, so the packs like to hound their prey to exhaustion before going for the kill.”

The Aztlan’s pale eyes crinkled with pleasure and Tristan immediately knew he’d made a mistake.

“I wonder,” Tupoc idly said, “how it is that a Sacromonte gutter rat knows that.”

The thief swallowed a curse as Acanthe shot him an assessing look. The Aztlan had been goading him all this time for a reaction and now he’d finally gotten it. Cutting his losses, he moved away from the two and Tupoc let him retreat with a pleasant smile. The skirmish was good as done anyhow, the lupines unwilling to risk another attack. They must have been blood-mad to risk one on such a large group in the first place. The column moved away, word from the front coming that a good camping site awaited two hours ahead. The lemures disappeared from the back as they left the clearing for the forest ahead, likely gone back to eat the corpses of their own.

They would return, though, and so after another tiring stretch of march through the woods it was with relief that Tristan saw the camp site that had been chosen.

It was well-situated, he must admit. The first stretch of forest behind them had come at an end, revealing long rolling plains stretching out for many miles ahead until another treeline began near what must be the foot of the looming mountains. To the northwest, the silhouette of the old aqueduct known as the High Road could be glimpsed in the weak starlight if you stood at the edge of the lanterns long enough. It was close, no more than an hour’s march away. The camping site itself was maybe a quarter hour away past the woods, two sloping hills with a slender cut between them. They had signs of regular use, with firepits already dug and dried out latrines.

Under the orders of the infanzones, who acted as if they knew of the place already and likely did – it was an open secret the families kept records – a camp was raised. The firepits were fed with wood and charcoal as two watchers took places at the summit of the hills, which would give a broad view of the plains below. The nobles raised their tents near the fires and their followers put down bedrolls around them, everyone else radiating outwards around the hills. As one of the infanzones’ recruits, Tristan earned a place halfway down the western hill near Yong and Lady Villazur’s hired hand Sanale.

The likes of the married pair and the two greyhairs had to settle for further down on either hill, the first to be dragged into the night should some lemure or cultist slip past the vigilance of the watchers.

It was no grimmer than the truth of the city he’d been born in, Tristan figured, only stripped of the usual varnish that allowed people to ignore it. Putting down his bedroll and medicine cabinet, the thief checked in with the Cerdan valet for his time to keep watch and was sneeringly informed his turn was to be near morning, five hours past midnight. Inyoni’s nephew Zenzele, who he was to replace, would come to wake him. Pleased at the given time, for it meant he would get most of a night’s sleep uninterrupted, Tristan bade good sleep to Yong and flopped down tiredly on his bedroll.

He was asleep within moments.

—

“Tristan,” Fortuna hissed. “Tristan, you need to wake up.”

His eyes struggled to open, sleep fighting to keep them closed. His entire body felt lazy, like he’d spent an afternoon napping, and though he could hear Fortuna he struggled to remember why he should care about what she said.

“You idiot,” the goddess cursed. “Get up, someone’s pinning a murder on you.”

Sheer surprise and anger tore through the veil he’d been wrapped in, eyes futtering open as he woke. The fires crackled in the distance, everyone asleep around him, and the thief bit his lip so he would not snarl. That tiredness had not been natural. Someone had used a contract on him. Shifting in his bedroll, Tristan caught Fortuna’s eyes. The goddess, red dress bunched around her as she knelt in the grass, looked every inch the unearthly creature in the flickering light of the flames. Hair and eyes of molten gold, he thought.

“Who?” he murmured.

“Couldn’t see,” she admitted. “Their face was covered. I’m pretty sure it’s a man, though.”

Tristan grimaced. The goddess could not stray too far from him, rarely more than a room’s length, she would not have been able to follow the stranger back to wherever they’d hidden. She wouldn’t be able to name his enemy. First get out of the trap, he reminded himself.

“Where?”

His murmur was answered by Fortuna gesturing at his medicine cabinet. Inside? Gods, how hard had he been hit by the contract not to wake while someone was going through his belongings a mere two feet away?

“Keep watch,” Tristan said, and went to have a look.

It was difficult to unlatch the cabinet and crack it open without making a sound while laying down, but it was not his first time needing quiet fingers. At first glance nothing was amiss, but then Tristan saw them: a dagger, carefully inserted between two vials, and a rag pushed into a half-hidden nook. A bloody rag, his closer look revealed. He unfolded it, careful to get nothing on his fingers, and saw that an edge had been wiped clear of blood on the cloth. Just enough to get me hanged if they catch me with it, he thought.

Whoever had done this had been careful not to make him look like a complete fool: clever enough to hide and wipe the knife, just not to get rid of the rag after. If he were to sell the story in place of his foe, Tristan decided, he’d say that the rag was only hidden until it could be cleanly disposed of in a fire. Quietly he folded the cloth anew and took the dagger, beginning to close the cabinet silently as he put his mind to work along his hands. Someone must be dead, otherwise a wound deep enough to bleed this much blood would have woken them.

More importantly, whoever had killed them wanted him to take the fall for it.

Had he made an enemy, or had he simply seemed like a good sort to leave behind for the noose? There was no denying that he’d been picked out in particular, with the way a contract had been used on him. Only, he thought, it could not only be him who’d been touched by power. There were watchers as well and they would have noticed someone moving around so they must have been subjected to the contract too. Unless they were in on it, he considered, but then discarded the thought. Tristan was simply not important enough to be conspired against. That did not mean, however, that trying to out the scheme would be wise.

A rat with a blood-soaked rag and a corpse someone needed to answer for? Even if he was the one to make a ruckus in the middle of the night, there were decent odds he’d still end up the one hanged. If it was one of the nobles that’d done it, they’d close ranks to bury him. Not worth the risk. That did not mean there was not a solution: someone had done all the hard parts of pinning a murder and there was no need to waste all that work when he could use it instead. Closing the cabinet, he rose onto his knees. He could only see one of the watchers from here, but the Ramayan girl – Shalini, if he recalled correctly – was utterly still. No shifting around, no stoking the flames, no looking anywhere but straight ahead.

Calming his breathing, smoothing his thoughts into calm, the thief stole the knife and rag from the grass before crawling forward. Silently, as not to wake any of those sleeping near him. Moving up the hill, he paused only to grab a loose pebble and gauge the distance. A heartbeat later he threw the small stone near Shalini, waiting tensely as it bounced off a half-buried log. The noise would have been unmistakeable, but she did not so much twitch. Still under the contract, then, just as he would be had Fortuna not shouted at him until he stirred. Good, that meant he had his opening. The crawl resumed until he was near the fires, where the tents of the infanzones had been raised.

He could not see within, but outside lay their closest servants. The Cerdan valet, Isabel Ruesta’s maids – Beatris was unharmed, a relief – but to his displeasure not Cozme Aflor. Counting the tents again, he concluded that the Cerdan brothers must be sharing one while Cozme had claimed the other. It was too risky to try for a tent, he reluctantly admitted to himself. He’d have to lower his aim: the Cerdan valet, Gascon. The brothers were unlikely to start carrying their own bags even if the valet was cast out, which meant it’d likely end up Cozme’s work for all his pretensions that he was the one really in charge. He’d be more tired, more vulnerable, more likely to give Tristan an opening.

Planting the goods was not all that difficult.

The rag he hid under a flat rock a few feet away from the sleeping valet, with just a hint of the corner peeking out, and he slid the knife under the sleeping man’s neatly folded jacket. As he began to withdraw he saw the redheaded maid suddenly turn in her bedroll, yawning as she pawed at her loose hair. Tristan breathed in sharply, preparing to borrow luck, but she never opened her eyes. He stayed still as a statue until her breath evened out, asleep again. Flush from the scare, he crawled his way back down the hill and slipped hastily back into his bedroll. Unseen, he thought, but he could not be sure. There would be no telling for certain until morning came.

Though the thief knew he would need the rest, it still took him all too long to fall back asleep.

—

The second time, he woke to a scream.

Putting on a show, Tristan reached for his knife and rose with a gasp. Yong was brandishing his sword, eyes wide open, and the both of them found a crowd gathering on the side of the eastern hill. The corpse was there, below where the Asphodel pair had been sleeping, and he padded over on bare feet to have a look the body. The moment he did his breath caught in his throat and he knew why he’d been the one chosen to take the fall: it was one of the twins. Ju, he was fairly sure, the one he’d struck yesterday. That was not, he grimly thought, a good look for him right now. It was her sister who’d found the corpse, and Lan was red-eyed and shaking. Old Vanesa gently took her by the arm, offering comfort, but the blue-lipped woman pushed her away. She rose to her feet, eyes moving to him out of all the crowd as she did, and Tristan’s stomach clenched. Revenge was but a shout away for her.

“My sister,” Lan croaked out, “was murdered in the night. Her throat slit like some pig for slaughter.”

Tristan tensed as he forced himself not to squirm under her gaze, but then Lan’s eyes moved away.

“Until we find who did it,” she said, “no one here is safe.”

Abject relief. An accusation would have been no proof, but sometimes it didn’t take much to whip up a mob. And a mob was very much in the making here, by the looks on people’s faces as the crowd swelled.

“There’s no stream near here to wash,” Inyoni called out. “Someone herewill have blood on them.”

The scarred older woman, like her charges, had been sleeping just on the other side of the hill. She’d been one of the first to join the gathering throng.

“We have waterskins,” Brun calmly pointed out. “There is no need for a stream.”

The other Sacromontan had slept on the opposite side of the western hill, the infanzones between them, but still been one of the first to arrive after the scream. Already up, Tristan figured. By now long enough had passed for said infanzones to learn they had a mess on their hands, so like a pack of lupines they showed up all at once. Tredegar along, of course, having become the muscle for their crew more than she likely realized.

“Cold water won’t wash out blood well,” Remund Cerdan announced, tone certain. “I can still inspect everyone for traces.”

“And why is it,” Zenzele asked with wary eyes, “that you would be doing the inspecting?”

The other man blinked, as if it had never occurred to him he might be questioned.

“Watch your tongue, Malani,” he bit back. “You almost sound as if you are accusing an infanzon of-”

“We are not in Sacromonte, Cerdan,” the chubby-cheeked Ramayan called Ishaan calmly interrupted. “Posturing does you no good.”

Isabel Ruesta, looking like the very picture of anguish, stepped in between them. Tristan almost snorted, thinking she was laying it on a little thick. How most people who met her seemed not to notice never felt to surprise him: she wasn’t that good an actress.

“Now is no time to turn on each other with wild accusations,” Ruesta implored. “What could Remund have had to gain, even were he a man to murder?”

“What did anyone here have to gain?” Ferranda Villazur bit out after her. “It was a senseless thing. For all we know a cultist did this in the night.”

Her appeal for an outside enemy was swiftly ignored.

“There is one,” Angharad Tredegar evenly said, “who quarrelled with the sisters yesterday.”

Fuck, the thief thought. And now came the price for yesterday. Eyes turned to him, a crowd’s worth of them as near everyone had gathered around the corpse by now, but Tristan did not flinch. If he showed weakness they would devour him whole.

“We quarrelled over a pistol which is still in my possession,” Tristan replied. “Would slitting her throat somehow make it even more mine, Tredegar?”

“No one else of this company has done violence on another,” the Pereduri pressed. “Who else is there?”

“You are,” he replied, “trying to do me violence right now.”

At that she balked, long enough for someone else to speak up.

“If we throw accusations without proof,” Sarai said, “any one us of could be the culprit. Lady Inyoni and Lord Remund are correct: we should look for evidence first.”

And a mere heartbeat after she stopped speaking, as if it had been timed, there was an exclamation of surprise. One coming from near the tents of the infanzones, which raised Tristan’s spirits even as the Tianxi with the silver eyes – Song – flipped over the stone near the valet’s bedroll and revealed the bloody cloth.

“Blood,” Song announced. “Too much for a simple cut.”

Tristan’s eyes narrowed. Fortuna, leaning against shoulder lazily, hummed in agreement. Both of them were well-acquainted with chance, and that timing had been more than simply fortunate. It reeked of collaboration, but what for? Had they been behind all of this? Tristan could not remember seeing the two women exchange more than few words since they’d come aboard the Bluebell and he’d sought enmity with neither of them. It seemed off for them to try to frame him for an equally senseless murder, the pieces didn’t fit. Whatever the truth, he was immediately forgot.

The crowd exploded in jeers and shouts at the revelation of the bloody cloth, Gascon loudly exclaiming he had nothing to do with this but swiftly drowned out by a tide of indignation. Not even his masters could prevent his affairs from being searched, and chubby-cheeked Ishaan was the one to lift the jacket and reveal the planted knife. The Ramayan held it up triumphantly and in the moment that followed half the crowd looked willing to cut Gascon’s throat themselves. That was where things took a turn.

“What of it?” Augusto Cerdan called out, shouting down the accusations. “It is his knife, you fools, I gave it to him myself years ago. He merely forgot to put it away.”

“It is true,” Remund immediately agreed. “This is no proof at all, only nonsense. We all have knives. Where is the blood on the blade?”

Tristan, just for a moment, considered the possibility that whoever had murdered Jun in the night had used another man’s knife for it. Wondered at the foresight of the murderer. And then he set that absurd thought aside, considering the much simpler proposition that the Cerdans were covering for their valet in case some of the shit he was dragging in ended up splashing them. It wasn’t enough, though, and by the looks on the brothers’ faces they knew it. They were not in favour with the other people here, not after having hidden away during the fight on the Bluebell. So Isabel Ruesta spoke up, eyes calm for all that her face looked troubled, and Tristan knew it was over.

“Briceida,” the noblewoman called out, “you have known Gascon for years. Is it true, is the knife his own?”

The redheaded maid smiled broadly.

“It is, my lady,” she said. “I swear it.”

That gave the others pause. Even if it were untrue, forcing the matter would now make this a much larger trouble than a single corpse. The infanzones commanded the largest group and were obviously making common front – one that counted a troubled-looking Angharad Tredegar, that one-woman battalion.  Meanwhile, who did Lan have backing her? Not a soul. Tristan saw that revelation sink into the surviving twin, the way she looked as if she had been struck. The impotent rage that twisted blue-tinted lips when she realized that no one would do a damn thing about her twin being killed in the night because no one cared enough. And that was when, naturally, Tupoc Xical decided to step in.

“I do not care for this talk of knives,” the Aztlan dismissed, “but for this instead: how was it done?”

A moment of surprise followed.

“The Tianxi’s throat was cut but there is little blood spray on the grass and it is even,” the man continued. “She did not move. Who does not wake or struggle even as they are dying?”

Someone touched by a contract, Tristan encouraged. He’d be mocked if he suggested as much, but the Aztlan was not someone they would laugh at.

“Someone who was drugged,” Tupoc said instead. “And there is only one here who carries such substances.”

The eyes went back to him, the thief’s blood going cold as the crowd’s mood turned again. Even the gaze of the infanzones, whose crew he was meant to be part of. Only he was on their mirror-dancer’s bad side and he would be a scapegoat for this mess much less close to them than the Cerdans’ own valet. If anything, they might just help bury him.

“I have a bottle of soporific in my cabinet,” Tristan slowly acknowledged, playing for time, “but it is quite full. I invite you to look if you doubt me.”

He could only hope that it actually was full. He’d not checked every single bottle while on the Bluebell, which now struck him as a grave oversight.

“What point would there be?” Tupoc asked. “You could have topped it off with water, the colour is the same.”

“Then drink a mouthful,” Tristan acidly replied, “and tell us if it feels diluted.”

He could tell, though, that he was losing the crowd. What else was there, what shovel could he use to dig himself out?

“I carry half a dozen medicines that could be poisons, used in a malignant manner,” Tristan said. “What need would I have for a knife? If someone plucked a life unseen in the middle of the night, it seems to me more like the work of a contract than that of a bottle.”

“It could have been the Lord of the Thirteenth Heaven as well, I suppose,” Tupoc drawled, “but he is very far and your soporific fortuitously close. Besides, who is to say you do not have a contract yourself?”

The Aztlan was enjoying this, the thief thought. He could see it in the man’s pale eyes.

“Speak up then, boy,” Augusto Cerdan broke in, a man no older than Tristan. “Do you have a contract? What does it do?”

And now came the infanzones, bravely riding to the rescue of the only thing they cared about: their reputation. Tristan smiled, showing all his teeth.

“Your own valet is caught with a bloody cloth and a knife,” he said, “and yet I am the one answering questions. An interesting turn, Cerdan.”

He was teetering on the edge, and there was no telling which way it would go. Would anyone even speak for him, if the infanzones decided that he must be arrested ‘for the safety of all’? He’d have to try the luck, gods damn it all. But even if it got him out of the immediate trouble, how much worse would it land him in?

“It wasn’t him.”

Surprise caught his throat as silence spread over the hill and he turned to look at the speaker: Lan herself, mouth set in a straight line as she met his eyes.

“My sister and I spoke with him last night, we settled our affairs,” the blue-lipped woman lied. “There was no longer enmity between us. This is mudslinging.”

No one would argue with that he knew, not when it was her own sister that had been murdered, but already he was digging behind. Why? What did she gain by doing this? She had to know the murderer had good as gotten away with it already, what did she… Ah, Tristan thought. Two steps ahead, are you? She’d already seen through how it would end after no one paid for the death and decided to put him in her debt instead of making him an enemy. Only catching up now, his stomach clenched. He was about to lose everything he’d manoeuvred for.

“She’s right,” Inyoni snorted. “You’d bury your own mother to keep the dirt from touching your feet, Cerdan.”

“Fuck this,” her nephew Zenzele spat. “This isn’t going anywhere. Come on, auntie, we’re going. If they want to protect a killer it’s on their heads.”

“Agreed,” Ishaan snorted, throwing the knife into the grass hard enough it sunk to the hilt. “We part ways here.”

There were some token protests by Ruesta about the need to stick together, but it was theatre. She made no real attempt to mend fences and within a quarter hour Inyoni’s group of six was leaving. Herself, the nephew and his lover, the two Ramayans and that Aztlan called Yaretzi who sometimes tried to chat up Tredegar. She was a decent shot with a pistol, he’d seen yesterday, but nothing else of note. The group headed for the road north and no tears were shed at this first departure. Why would there be? As far as the infanzones were concerned, they’d averted a mess that would have entangled all of them and the groups had been meant to split later today anyhow.

Tristan stayed quiet and out of the way, knowing he too had come dangerously close to burning his fingers with this whole affair. Tupoc led his group away not long after, though not before making some smiling comments to the infanzones about trust. Taking the two from Asphodel and Ocotlan, he headed east towards the woods. Watching the pale-eyed Aztlan stroll away, the thief could shake the feeling that only one person this morn had gotten everything they were after and their name was Tupoc Xical.

After that there were only the infanzones and the soon-to-be leftovers remaining, so Tristan knew exactly what lay ahead. What Lan had seen before he did. The nobles would want to save face, and there was only one way left for them to do that. As he packed his affairs, the thief closed his eyes and forced himself to look for an angle. All his work to get close to the Cerdan, to lay down the foundation of his revenge, was about to be undone but there had to be something. There was always an angle. By the time Cozme came to fetch him, smiling all rueful like he cared in the slightest, Tristan still had nothing. It was like clawing at stone. Following the retainer, he found that the infanzones, their servants and other recruits were already waiting.

The thief had not even noticed Yong being sent for, stuck inside his own mind. The youngest Cerdan, Remund, began to yammer on but Tristan only paid him half a mind. Something about how their valet could not be the killer, that he of course did not believe Tristan was the killer either but who could know? His older brother gravely added that they could not possibly put Isabella at even the slightest risk, surely Tristan understood. If this were Sacromonte they would have simply dismissed him with a smack on the mouth, telling him to mind his betters, but here they had to go through this charade because they needed others to follow them. Tredegar, Brun, Song, Yong. All useful hands, all people that needed to be reassured they wouldn’t be thrown aside easily. A lie, but one the infanzones did not want seen through too quickly.

It gave him no pleasure to see them go through these contortions, not when there was nothing he could do about the ending. The older Cerdan droned on while Ruesta looked at him with limpid eyes, as if full of sympathy. Ferrdana Villazur’s open boredom was, at least, refreshingly honest. She wanted this over with as much as he did. It had already been decided he was to be cast out of their little group, lose his opportunity to get at Cozme and the Cerdans, and there was nothing in his hands that could hurt them. Nor did his allies – the thief stilled. Not allies, no. But there were enemies aplenty. Lupines who would be hunting them all, soon enough, and that could… But how to deliver it?

His revelation was encroached on by Isabel Ruesta’s voice.

“I do not believe it either, I assure you,” she told him. “And you came recommended to me by Beatris, who I most dearly trust. If she speaks again for your character, I will insist you remain with us.”

Tristan stilled. The Cerdans looked surprised and angry while Tredegar looked resigned, which implied Ruesta might not be simply posing. What would she get out of this? After a heartbeat he decided she wanted him under her thumb. Someone who’d owe her and not balk at doing the kind of things Tredegar wouldn’t. The thief’s eyes moved to Beatris and he saw the maid touch her jacket’s pocket, the same one where she had stashed away the ruby he’d given her. He saw the calculation in her eyes and the answer she came to.

He’d already killed Recardo, and now he came with too many enemies attached.

“I do not know him deeply, my lady,” Beatris said. “I cannot truly speak to his character.”

She did not look away when he met her eyes, unashamed. As well she should be. Tristan was not angry, not really. How could he be, when just yesterday he had struck one the twins for a relic pistol? This was nothing more than the Law of Rats, the same he lived by. Beatris would do all she could to survive, as he would in her place. It would have been a hypocrite’s game to claim anger here. Ruesta looked taken aback for a moment, then demurred to her maid.

“I can only follow your words, of course,” she said.

Beatris not playing along had clearly been unexpected and Ruesta looked, amusingly enough, like she’d been the one who just got a knife in the back. He breathed in sharply. That idle thought, that detail, was the last piece Tristan had needed. All of it fell into place and suddenly there was no longer a need to humour any of this.

“I will put us all out of our misery,” the thief said, “and simply take my leave before Lord Augusto begins another speech.”

“Thank you,” Ferranda Villazur frankly said.

He walked away, deciding not to risk a glance at Yong. The thought was tempting to try and ruin his chances to ensure he was forced to stick by Tristan, but the infanzones were unlikely to throw away a skilled soldier on the thief’s behalf and an unwilling ally could be as dangerous as an enemy anyhow. Instead he made straight for his medicine cabinet, discreetly reaching for a small green vial near the middle compartments while pretending to be arranging the vials. Yes, lodestone extract was there just as the drawing in Alvareno’s Dosages outline. A shadow was cast over him in lantern light, Tristan looking up to find Yong standing there.

“I did not expect a courtesy goodbye,” Tristan admitted. “I wish you good luck on the road, Yong.”

He hesitated, wondering whether he should offer a warning and how to phrase it so his scheme would not be threatened.

“I would hope so,” the Tianxi replied, “since we’re headed down the same one.”

The grey-eyed thief paused.

“Your odds might be better with them,” he finally said.

The Tianxi soldier eyed the bottle in his hand.

“Somehow I doubt that,” he said. “Besides, we struck a bargain.”

The thief cocked an eyebrow. Neither of them were Malani, to be obsessed with honour and oaths.

“And their way of going about things leave a bad taste in my mouth,” Yong admitted. “They’re headed to the High Road out west for some reason, they want to let the rest of us go first.”

It only took him a moment to figure it out.

“Lupine bait,” the thief guessed. “While we’re being eaten they’ll sneak past the packs.”

“That is also my read,” Yong grunted, “and I’ve had too much of that tired old game.”

Tristan studied him for a long moment, looking at the older man’s sweating face. He’d begun drinking already, the thief thought.

“One day,” he said, “I’d like to know why you left Tianxia.”

Their eyes met.

“No,” Yong mirthlessly smiled. “You wouldn’t.”

The former soldier flicked a glance at the crew forming around the infanzones, frowning.

“If you have a scheme, now is the time for it,” he said. “They’re about to leave.”

For the barest moment, Tristan hesitated. Beatris was with them. But then he considered the thought of letting the infanzones get away with it, of letting them walk away clean like they always did, and it burned like coals in his belly. In the end, all that he owed his fellow rat was the ugly law they’d been born to: nothing more and nothing less.

Tristan uncorked the green bottle. The transparent fluid inside was sticky yet surprisingly liquid, so he was careful not to spill any as he wet his right hand. He carefully put the bottle back and closed the cabinet, walking over to where the crowd had gathered for the last of the earlier squabbling. There Ishaan had angrily thrown the knife the infanzones lied about and there it still was. Tristan ripped it clear of the ground with his left hand, careful to slather the leather grip with the liquid. He then strode right into the midst the infanzones’ crew, blade in hand. Song loosely aimed her musket his way and Tredegar put her hand on her saber, but he went straight for Augusto Cerdan and smiled.

He flipped the knife, offering the handle to the scowling infanzon.

“You gifted it to your valet, didn’t you say?” Tristan said. “Have it back. Perhaps back in your hands it won’t earn so poor a reputation.”

With all those eyes on him, with Ruesta’s eyes on him, Augusto could not back down from the implied challenge. He took the knife, fingers closing around the extract-drenched handle. It would have felt humid, but not wet. Not enough to draw suspicion.

“That mouth of yours will cost you some day, boy,” the infanzon coldly said. “More than it already has.”

“We all pay the price at the end, Cerdan,” Tristan easily replied. “It’s the single fair thing in all the world.”

And with that he walked away from the infanzon, from the lot of them, and back up the hill as they began to leave. The moment they were out of sight, Tristan rushed to his medicine cabinet. He carefully opened it using only his left hand, unlatching the clasps and reaching for the glass bottle at the bottom. Shoving it under his armpit as he reached for a rag, he pulled the cork and wet the rag with grain alcohol. Methodically, ignoring all the eyes on him, the thief wiped his hand and the edge of his clothes with the wet rag. He was particularly careful with his skin, knowing that lodestar extract would sink in unless dissolved by alcohol.

“So what was that about?” Yong bluntly asked.

Tristan finished up with the rag and tossed it away, careful not step anywhere near it. He then cast a look at the seven people he’d be taking the Trial of Lines with, the band of leftovers than no one else had wanted. Yong and Sarai, the drunk and the woman wearing a mask. The exhausted and bickering married pair of Aines and Felis – the gambler and the dust addict. Grief-stricken Lan who had put him in her debt, her once-polished smile replaced by poorly hidden rage. And then the greyhairs, bespectacled Vanesa and ever-coughing Franchowith his toothless smile. It was not the crew he’d wanted, but it was the one he had. He must make the most of it. An introduction was in order, a proper one.

“Are any of you familiar with lodestone extract?” Tristan asked.

He got mostly blank looks, though Lan frowned as if trying to recall something. Most importantly, Francho’s eyes lit up.

“You coated the knife in it?” the old man asked.

“The handle,” the thief agreed.

The greyhair hummed in understanding.

“And for those of us unfamiliar with the substance?” Sarai asked.

“The lodestone bush is a plant that grows berries,” Francho explained, tone gone professorial. “It is common across the west and south of the Trebian Sea. The berries, while comestible, have an unpleasant side effect.”

“Their juice doesn’t smell like anything to us,” Tristan revealed, “but to lemures, they reek of fresh blood.”

A moment of silence. Lemures like lupines, the beasts with the noses of hunting hounds crawling around these parts.

“The extract,” Yong slowly said, “it will be more concentrated than the raw berry juice, won’t it?”

“At least a hundred times, if it is anything like what is sold in Sacromonte markets,” Old Francho said, grinning a toothless grin. “Clever boy. Every lupine for a dozen miles will be after them like they’re the only meat at the feast.”

The thief only smiled a pleasant, friendly smile.

“They meant to use us to clear their path,” he shrugged. “I am only returning the favour in kind.”

Tristan liked to think of himself as a practical man, even when moved by revenge. It did not matter if the deed was not of his own hand, so long as Cozme and the Cerdans died.

# Chapter 9

They’d not left the campsite for half an hour before it got worse.

“We agreed to pool our men together, Ferranda,” Augusto Cerdan shouted. “You would go back on your word?”

“I gave no word,” Lady Ferranda Villazur evenly replied, “and go back on nothing. If you assumed, Cerdan, that is on your head alone.”

The eldest of the Cerdan brothers was the one barking the loudest but he was not the one Angharad was wary of. Twice now Remund had tried to catch Cozme Aflor’s eye, to give him a silent order, and only the retainer’s obstinate pretence he had not noticed was preventing that disaster in the making. Isabel had retreated behind her maids, wisely so, but the rest of the infanzones were at each other’s throats: Lady Ferranda and her hired huntsman Sanale standing on one side, the Cerdans and their retainers on the other.

The Cerdan valet, Gascon, had pulled a pistol out of his blue-and-red livery and his impressive moustache bristled with his masters’ anger. Lord Augusto had not drawn his sword, for all the red flush of his face, but his younger brother’s left hand was kept under his cloak and to Angharad’s eye the stance spoke of his holding either a pistol or a knife. Master Cozme, the real fighter of the lot, had pointedly refrained from reaching for a weapon but Lady Ferranda still kept a hand on the grip of the slender sword at her hip. She must be feeling the weight of the numbers arrayed against her.

“Turn on us now and we will remember it, Villazur,” Remund sneered. “It is all of your house that will feel the displeasure of the Cerdan.”

Angharad’s teeth clenched. That, she thought, was a step too far. By the open disgust on Song’s face and the blankness on Brun’s, she was not the only one to think as much. Lady Ferranda’s eyes went cold.

“Watch your tongue, you viperous brat,” she said. “If you threaten my kin again, I swear by the Manes there will be blood.”

Remund smiled, triumph in his eyes.

“See, I told you she was against us,” the Cerdan announced to all. “For all we know she was the one who killed that Tianxi peasant. What if she comes back to attack us in the night? We can’t afford to let her loose.”

Angharad had been reluctant to step in, for the affairs of the infanzones were theirs to settle, but when Remund’s claim was answered by the sound of Ferranda Villazur unsheathing her rapier she knew the time for such courtesy was past. She cleared her throat, shoulders tensing.

“You have made a grave accusation, Lord Remund,” Angharad stated. “Kindly either prove or withdraw it.”

The infanzon’s dark eyes swept the crowd, but as he did his face reddened. The Cerdan had made few friends and none now cared to back the youngest’s wild accusation. Remund tugged at his blue doublet’s high collar, nervousness seeping into his eyes as it sunk in he might be short of defenders.

“You are here at our sufferance, Tredegar,” he began. “You-”

Brun took a measured step closer to Angharad’s side, hand on his hatchet. The sight of it had Remund trailing off.

“I would like to hear your proof as well, Lord Remund,” Brun said.

The weight of Song’s silver eyes burned against the side of Angharad’s face for a long moment, before the Tianxi idly took a step closer to them both. She did not reach for her musket but the implication was clear.

“My brother spoke in anger and shamed himself,” Augusto Cerdan suddenly cut in. “He never meant to impugn Lady Ferranda’s reputation.”

Remund’s face twisted in fury, as much turned on his now-smiling brother as Angharad herself. She met his gaze, unimpressed. Though it was true that the company assembled at the beginning of the trial had ended, and so the oath not to do violence on one another as well, Lady Ferranda had given them no reason to bare steel.

“Do you withdraw your accusation, Remund?” the fair-haired Villazur bit out.

Movement to the side as Isabel strode past her maids, shaking her head.

“Of course he does, Ferranda, do not be silly,” Isabel said. “You know how men’s tempers are, he was only angered you would leave us so. I’m sure he is most sorry.”

A pause.

“Naturally,” Remund said, after a beat. “It is as Isabel says.”

And so, Angharad noted, he was spared from having to recant and apologize with his own words. Cleverly done, if Isabel’s intent was to spare him further humiliation, but the Pereduri’s lips thinned. One’s honour should not be left in another’s hands. The ploy reminded her all too much of the tales Mother had told her of the High Queen’s court, of courtiers confessing to the misdeeds of their izinduna patrons so that those hallowed personages’ honour would not be stained. It was a base sort of cleverness, one she had not expected of Isabel. She is only trying to keep the peace, Angharad decided. That is a laudable thing.

“Then we have nothing else to say to each other,” Lady Ferranda stiffly replied, sheathing her blade. “It is best we part ways swiftly.”

“If you prefer,” Augusto Cerdan shrugged. “A shame Remund’s manners were so poor as to drive you away.”

Angharad’s jaw clenched. Was there anything in all of Vesper that would have the brothers cease pricking one another? Ferranda bad curt goodbyes to her fellow infanzones, even to Isabel, and ignored their attendants entirely. She grew warmer only when coming over towards the others, kindly bidding farewell to Song and Brun before turning to Angharad herself.

“Your help was most appreciated, my lady,” Ferranda said, laying hand on her heart and bowing slightly.

Angharad was not familiar with the gesture but mimicked it easily enough.

“It was nothing,” she replied.

“It was not,” Ferranda firmly said, “and I will not forget it. I hope we may meet again come the Trial of Ruins and share a road for a time.”

“I look forward to it,” Angharad said, meaning every word, but cocked her heat to the side. “I mean no slight, but are you quite certain you two should set out alone?”

“I have long prepared for these trials, my lady,” the other woman said. “Believe me when I say I am certain indeed.”

“Then I will not wish you luck you ill need,” Angharad smiled, “but may the God’s blessing go with you.”

Ferranda looked startled.

“You are a Universalist?”

“As are most Pereduri,” Angharad agreed. “The Redeemers never made many converts among us.”

The faiths might have the same source and believe in the same Sleeping God, but the hardline beliefs of the Redeemers had always made her uncomfortable. Their insistence that Vesper was the test of the God and he gave neither blessing nor succour, that devils and hollows were inherent instruments of evil, struck her as wretched. The Universalist creed, that the Sleeping God had divided himself into all save devils and all would return to him when he woke to be judged for their deeds, felt like a kinder and deeper truth.

Not that a Sacromontan would know much of either creed. Their city was in the old heartlands of the Second Empire, the cradle of the Orthodoxy. The Lierganen had spread their faith far and wide, converting most of the known world, but since Malan had been only a distant province of the empire it had been spared the imposition of the imperial creed. Not that the Orthodoxy was so orthodox, these days. Tianxia and the Someshwar both claimed to be the seat of the faith since the fall of Tarteso, occasionally going to war over it.

“I should have guessed from the lack of haughty sermons,” Ferranda snorted, but her amusement soon faded.

It was replaced by a flicker of hesitation before the blonde’s expression firmed.

“A word of warning,” she spoke in a whisper. “Isabel has already lost what she came to this island for, and will now look to other prizes.”

“I do not understand,” Angharad frowned.

“You are not a choice she ever intends to make,” Lady Ferranda said, not unkindly.

Without further ceremony, the other woman offered her a nod and decisively broke away. Angharad was left trying not to gape, as much from her flirtation with Isabel having been caught on to as by how out of the black the warning was. And unnecessary. She hardly expected marriage out of a liaison that had yet to even begin and had not even found it in her to daydream of being joined in the Watch by the lovely infanzona. Isabel did not seem well-suited to such a life. No, their affair – should it bloom – would end with the trials and remain only a fond memory. It was kind of Lady Ferranda to try to protect her feelings, but she had no undue expectations to be wounded by. Angharad was still wrestling with the suddenness of it all when Song and Brun joined her.

“A very polite woman,” Brun said, glancing at the departing pair.

He sounded approving. Lady Ferranda and her hired man were heading east, Angharad saw, towards the road that supposedly led all the way to the mountains and the second trial awaiting within them. The Trial of Ruins, it was called. The Cerdans had several times implied it was some sort of maze.

“And clever,” Song mused. “She waited until everyone else was gone to part ways with us.”

Angharad glanced at her.

“You believe she wants others to think she is still with our group,” she slowly said.

“A lone pair would be vulnerable,” Song said. “But less so if no one knows they went off on their own.”

Vulnerable to who, Angharad could have asked, but she knew the answer. She simply did not want to consider it.

“Then you suspect, as she must, that the murderer did not act alone,” she murmured. “That there are those among us who would hunt other trial-takers.”

“I suspect the same,” Brun frankly said. “And while I have no proof, it occurs to me that Tupoc Xical was pleased our great company parted ways on such poor terms.”

“He also went hard after that man Tristan,” Song noted. “Not without grounds, but it did feed the fires just when they were beginning to cool.”

Angharad grimaced. She was not unaware she had acted poorly there, also casting the blame on the apprentice physician. It was only sensible that when an oath-breaking killing was had one should look at where honour had proved loosest, but she could admit to herself that was not the sole reason she’d spoken. It had been so deeply embarrassing, to find the man she’d thought a kind soul standing over a beaten woman with a debt collector’s weapon in hand. It’d felt like he had taken advantage of her, back on the ship, and wounded pride had moved her lips. Her father had always admonished her over lessons of law, saying that justice could spring only from clear mind and cold heart.

Would that she had listened to him, instead of laughing that she would find a wife to run Llanw Hall’s estate for her just as Mother had found a husband. She could not quite shake the Sacromontan’s sharp retort. You are attempting to do me violence right now, he had said, and had he been wrong? Angharad had not bared a blade but an accusation before the others was almost as dangerous. It gnawed at her, that while respecting the letter of her oath she might well have violated the spirit. And for wounded pride, of all things. She had felt guilty enough to accept when Isabel brought up the notion of keeping the physician in the fold.

“I added to the flames myself,” Angharad admitted. “It was ill-done, and I do not know if I owe him apology but there should be some redress.”

Another debt to mark, one of the many she seemed to be accruing these days. Like a drunken vagrant, she racked up accounts wherever she drifted to. What she would not give to be home again, where it had all made sense and her life had been a well-lit road ahead of her instead of the darkened trail she was now stumbling down.

“I would not say he’s earned so much,” Song said, “but that is your decision to make.”

Angharad sighed, forcing herself to set aside the pointless thoughts.

“Tupoc is dangerous,” she finally agreed. “He recruited fighters for a reason, and though I do not know whether he would hunt others outright I do not believe he would balk at violence should he meet us.”

“They went east, towards the woods,” Brun said. “Of all the groups we should be the least likely to run into his.”

True enough, as they were headed northwest towards the long aqueduct known as the High Road. For what Angharad did not yet know, as the infanzones had been tight-lipped about their plans, but she would soon learn. She had been told they were not far from the structure, a mere half hour of walk. Lady Ferranda’s departure and the tenor of it having left a pall on them all, at first the mood was grim when they set out on their journey again. Angharad took the vanguard with Cozme Aflor once more, leaving the back to Song and Gascon. Brun, she saw with a thread of amusement, was chatting with Isabel’s redheaded maid again. They seemed quite charmed by one another.

Isabel herself stood between the Cerdans, a pleasant smile on her face as the three conversed. Angharad could only wonder whether at how genuine it might be, given how much more sharply the brothers had begun sniping at each other since the beginning of the trial. She kept her eyes ahead, however, looking for threats as the light of the great lantern Cozme carried swept the grounds before them. Her companion at the front was not one for silences, so it was not long before he spoke up.

“Shame how it turned out in camp,” Cozme idly said. “We could have used them.”

“It does feel like our company’s ranks have grown thin,” she said. “I regret my hand in that.”

Cozme snorted.

“Don’t think it’s a reproach, Lady Tredegar,” the older man said. “I’m not sure that Tristan boy cut the other rat’s throat, but he was a little too slick for my tastes. Always up to something. I won’t mourn leaving him behind.”

The greying retainer sighed.

“Yong, now? That was a loss,” he said. “Wish I knew what made him leave.”

“He was a skilled marksman,” Angharad slowly agreed, “but why such esteem? You are a fair shot yourself.”

“You know that knot he had on top of his head?” Cozme said, gesturing towards the back of his own.

Angharad nodded.

“It’s the way men from Caishen do their hair when they go soldiering,” he said. “I’ve worked with some of them before and they’re hard men. some of the finest in Vesper.”

Angharad’s lessons on Tianxia had involved learning the Ten Republics by rote, but it took her a moment to place which one Caishen was.

“The city is near the borders with Izcalli and the Someshwar,” she said. “I was taught there is hardly a season there without skirmishing.”

“More than skirmishes, sometimes,” Cozme told her. “About twenty years ago the raj of Kurin decided he wanted to claim a slice of the lowlands, so Caishen mustered militia and mercenaries to turn him back. Only it turned into a rough stalemate, so a pack of Sunflower Lords led warbands over the border to attack both under banner of flower war.”

“That sounds…” Angharad began, looking for the right word. “Messy.”

“It was that,” Cozme grunted. “Bloody as all Hell too, and it took most a decade before the bleeding stopped.”

“Caishen won?” she asked.

“The Kurin troops shelled an old temple trying to push out the Izcalli, only they broke something they shouldn’t have and a horde of old gods came howling out,” he said. “They started killing everything so the Watch stepped in and told everyone to go home until they cleaned up the mess.”

It was for good reason that the blackcloaks were given the authority to force temporary truces under the Iscariot Accords, Angharad thought. Not even the most bloodthirsty of the Sunflower Lords wanted the devastation of the Succession Wars to come again, those ruinous days when entire kingdoms were swallowed up by the Gloam as the great powers fought tooth and nail to succeed Liergan’s hegemony.

“You believe this Yong fought in the conflict, then,” Angharad guessed.

“He has a veteran’s way about him and he’s in his forties,” Cozme replied. “I can’t be sure but I’d bet coin on it.”

Angharad saw no need to doubt her companion, their regular conversations having revealed that his fifty some years in Sacromonte left him learned in many matters. Not in the way a noble would be, a proper education, but in the manner of a skilled retainer. Useful knowledge, gathered on the ground.

“Sacromonte does seem to attract all sorts,” Angharad said. “You met these Caishen soldiers in the service of House Cerdan, I take it?”

“I used to work under Lord Lorient, the boys’ uncle,” Cozme said, tone wistful.

He shook his head.

“Not Lord Cerdan himself, one of his younger brothers,” he elaborated. “He ran the house’s affairs in Feria District for a few years and we used hired hands there. The war in Caishen was just over, so the port was flush with penniless mercenaries come to the City for work.”

Angharad found herself approving of the Cerdan generosity in employing such luckless men, a reminder that the brothers were not the sum whole of House Cerdan. The eastern ports of the Isles often found themselves flush with destitute souls from Izcalli when one its constant wars went badly for a Sunflower Lord, but Malan did not treat the exiles as kindly. Most of them ended up press-ganged into the High Queen’s navy or used as labour for the great shipyards.

The two of them kept up lively talk throughout the walk, the noblewoman finding Master Cozme to be as pleasant company as ever. It was obvious the older man missed his days spent serving Lord Lorient and was hoping to return to the man’s service after the trials. Why he was no longer under Lorient Cerdan was something Cozme remained vague about, though Angharad suspected he had made a blunder of some kind. Joining the trials to protect the Cerdan brothers must have been his way of expiating the mistake, a worthy redress.

Honour was not the sole province of nobles, Angharad reminded herself.

Finding the High Road proved easy enough, near the end, for the structure loomed tall above the plains. At least thirty feet tall, the aqueduct was a long stretch of arches going into the distance – first through plains, and likely even through the distant woods beyond them. Perhaps, Angharad thought, all the way to the mountains. The stone was weather-worn and smooth, she saw as she approached, and though there was no trace of where it once would have carried water to rain must still gather atop it: at the foot of where the arches began, the ground was a mess of stinking mud. The noblewoman stopped at the edge, wrinkling her nose.

“First Empire work, do you think?” Brun asked, coming to stand by her side.

She’d not heard him approach. How lightly the Sacromontan stepped, sometimes.

“It looks old enough,” Angharad agreed.

Not all remains of the First Empire were wondrous machinery. The Antediluvians had left great works of stone as well, fortresses and cities and stranger things – towers hidden beneath lakes, palaces balancing atop cliffs and even bridges that crossed half a sea. Many had aged poorly, shattered by war or the ravages of time as eras passed. First the Old Night, reigning for devils only knew how long, then Morn’s Arrival announcing their fall when the last of the Old World took refuge in the depths of Vesper. It had been centuries from then to the Second Empire and longer still to this day. Their curiosity was ended by Isabel sweetly calling for all to gather, the infanzones finally ready to reveal their plan.

Only between the Cerdan brothers and Isabel she found that Song was standing, unveiling a scroll under the light of a lantern held up by Gascon. All gathered close and Angharad sucked in a breath at the sight of what the Tianxi revealed: a map. Spirits, no wonder the infanzones had been unanimous in their desire for her to join. Angharad had wondered at such unusual unity. Hungry for a better grasp of their situation, the Pereduri leaned close. Though it was rough work, nothing at all like Malani sea charts, the outline of the Dominion of Lost Things was clear. They had landed at the southern end of the island, at a place named Lodoso Dock, and followed the road north.

Passing through nameless woods they were now on a plain that reached the shore on the western side but led into further forest to the north and east. The forest to the north was cut by a great river across which there were two bridges, and further beyond stood the mountains and a fort marked as the Trial of Ruins.

“Some of you might be wondering why it is that we have led you to the High Road,” Lord Augusto addressed everyone. “Now is the time to have your answers.”

He gestured at Song’s map, finger tracing the air above the thin grey line that was the aqueduct on the map. It went straight north, parallel to the road, and crossed woods and river to end against a mountainside.

“Its name is most apt, you see,” the eldest Cerdan told them smilingly. “We will climb the aqueduct and use it a high road across half the island, bringing us mere hours away from the Trial of Ruins without ever being at risk.”

“The aqueduct is intact all the way across?” Brun asked, skeptical.

A doubt earned, Angharad thought, if the two of them had been right in guessing the High Road to be a work of the First Empire. Her gaze left the map, instead turning to the tall arches. Not only was it of towering height but the weather-worn smoothness of the stone left no real grip for someone trying to climb. How were they to even reach up there?

“There are sections that fell apart,” Lord Augusto acknowledged, “but we have means to cross them.”

“I imagine,” Angharad slowly said, “that you also have equipment to climb our way up? It will take more than ropes and audacity to achieve this.”

She had not seen cliff-climbing gear among the bags of the infanzones, but then she had not looked for it. Augusto Cerdan smirked, the stern lines of his face softening.

“We have something altogether better,” he said.

His brother stepped forth, Remund preening under the weight of the gazes turned on him. With an arrogant smiled he brushed back his black curls, tucking them under that ridiculous plumed hat he insisted on wearing. Why Sacromonte fashion dictated a side of the brim should be pinned to the hat’s crown was beyond her – unlike a tricorn, it would not even properly keep the rain out of your face. Satisfied he had everyone’s attention, Remund Cerdan breathed out and began tracing thin air with his finger. For a startled moment Angharad thought he might be using a Sign, but the infanzon instead left a trail of thick light.

Contract, she thought. The youngest Cerdan finished with a flourish of the wrist, having traced a small circle of light whose hole faced the sky. Before anyone could think to ask as to the usefulness of such a thing, Remund dramatically took off his hat and hung it on the light as if it were a hook. Both hat and light remaining hanging in midair, to the amazement of several gathered around.

“I will be making us stairs all the way to the summit,” Lord Remund announced. “My power can support weight enough for a grown man and bags when properly focused.”

“That is impressive,” Angharad freely admitted.

“It is not a power without flaws,” Lord Augusto was quick to reveal. “Never let your flesh touch it, else it will be burned.”

The younger brother turned a hard gaze on him, visibly furious.

“Do not be miffed, Remund,” Isabel said, patting his arm. “We agreed to tell our companions as much, yes? No one wants an accident.”

“It was mine to reveal,” the youngest Cerdan insisted, but the edge to his anger was gone.

He sighed, snatching his hat back a heartbeat before the solid light snuffed itself out. Angharad studied him carefully, looking for a price but finding none visible. Was his pact like hers then, bound to a single great oathsworn act? She had not studied the lore of spirits in depth as a girl, but she remembered only old and powerful ones were capable of such things. The Fisher was one such, ancient as stony shores of Peredur and powerful enough a spirit to have formed a body, but that was not so rare a thing. Sacromonte, for all its waning splendour, was host to some great spirits of the Second Empire – the Manes, she thought them to be called.

“It will take us no more than four days to make it to the Trial of Ruins, keeping to a reasonable pace,” Song announced, carefully rolling up her map. “We carry rations and water enough to make it there without resupply.”

“The sanctuary in the mountains provides food and water for all,” Lord Augusto told them. “Our needs will be met.”

The infanzones knew much of the trials and it was no secret why. Isabel had candidly admitted to her during one of their walks that most noble houses kept records of the Dominion of Lost Things for their own, though the Watch forbade the tracing of maps during the trials so any drawn must be after and from memory. Song’s own map, of superior quality, must have been sold to her by a blackcloak and so stood a testament to the Tianxi’s resourcefulness. There were no arguments as to the plan the infanzones had revealed, rightfully so, and so without further ado the preparations for the climb began: Remund Cerdan, wearing thick cloves, began forging stairs with his contract.

Or so he had called them, but Angharad found them closer to a rising slope. The infanzon only ever drew circles she noticed, never another shape even if the sized varied, and seemed as wary of touching the solid light with his bare flesh as others must be. Lord Augusto went to oversee the servants while Song and Master Cozme kept watch, leaving Angharad free to spend her time in pleasant company. Isabel came to her side without being bid and they stood arm in arm as they watched Remund Cerdan put his contract to work.

Isabel had long traded her brocade dress for more practical clothes, much like her maids, but they were just as flattering to her form as the last. A long jacket over a blouse and a yellow satin bodice led into matching breeches and hose, the ensemble secured at the waist by a broad belt while below the hose disappeared into knee-high boots. Having eschewed jewels the infanzona had instead added a touch of panache through a wide-brimmed felt hat, angled roguishly.  Angharad’s eyes lingered on the delicately embroidered bodice and the slender waist it encircled so lovingly.

“Is my bodice so interesting, Lady Tredegar?” Isabel teased.

“I could be looking at your pistol, Lady Ruesta,” she easily replied, smirking back.

It was a small pearl-incrusted piece tucked into her belt, lacquered so heavily there was no telling what the wood beneath might be.

“That would be disappointing,” Isabel said. “I might have picked it thinking of you.”

It was an effort not to cough in embarrassment, but Angharad was not a girl and she had played this game before. Being smitten would only keep her on the backfoot for so long.

“You should have sent for me, then,” she lightly replied. “Should it not be my duty to help you put it on?”

Isabel’s green eyes glittered with amusement, but small fingers pinched Angharad’s side through her coat.

“Bold,” the infanzona half-heartedly chided.

“If that is your request,” Angharad drawled back, “I will endeavour to deliver.”

Isabel’s lips quirked.

“I had thought to offer you a walk with me tonight,” she said, “but I begin to think I would be courting danger.”

Angharad met her eyes, offering a roguish smile.

“Somehow I don’t think you’d mind a taste of… danger.”

Isabel’s cheeks pinkened, eyes widening, and she shyly looked away. It had been so very worth it to learn that smile after Thalente Cindi used it to get her into bed, Angharad mused and not for the first time either. Father had once caught her practicing it in the mirror, which had been mortifying, but not as much as the way he’d then given her advice about perfecting it. Surprisingly good advice, too, which had led her to suspect Mother might not have been as much the pursuer in that courtship as she’d always claimed. The sudden realization that she would never again speak with her father, that never again would she see Mother kiss his neck in affection as they talked of this and that, hit her like a shot in the belly.

She swallowed thickly, Isabel turning to shoot her a concerned glance at the sound. Angharad forced calm upon herself, setting aside the grief. She could not let the past catch up to her, lest it swallow her whole. Forward, ever forward until she took her revenge and at last she could allow herself to weep.

“Are you quite all right?” Isabel softly asked.

“I… miss my home,” Angharad finally replied, keeping to a truth exact. “It would be difficult to return.”

Isabel found her hand and squeezed it comfortingly.

“Difficulty does not last forever,” the infanzona said, then her voice became cadenced. “All things come and go, all that was will be: a closed circle is without end.”

Orthodoxy words, but kind ones. She took what little comfort there was to find within them, gaze returning to Remund Cerdan as he finished the last of his work. He’d climbed up, needing to draw the circles of light with his fingers, and was now a single one away from reaching the top of the aqueduct. His valet Gascon was holding up a lantern from below, its lights revealing a sight that had Angharad going utterly still. Remund’s skin was pale as milk, and for a disgusted heartbeat she thought the man had hollowed, turned into a darkling, but it was not so. His movements were oddly stiff and she realized that his skin was no longer skin at all: it was as if it’d turned into ivory. Even his eyes had gone pale. The noblewoman shivered in discomfort at the sight.

“It is not pretty,” Isabel quietly agreed. “The Tiller-of-Rectitude has twisted tastes, for all that his boons are powerful.”

“Is he a Mane?” Angharad asked in a whisper.

Isabel chuckled.

“No, nothing so impressive,” the dark-haired beauty replied. “He is a temple god, though, revered enough to have his built in the Old Alcazar. It was a coup for Remund to attract his attention.”

The work now finished, said Cerdan climbed atop the High Road and disappeared into the dark, perhaps hoping he had not been seen. His older brother directed the servants to begin bringing up the bags, Gascon and the Ruesta handmaids taking turns to bring up clothes. They covered their hands with washcloths to avoid being burned, the clumsiness it entailed slowing down the work even further. Angharad and Isabel reluctantly parted ways when her time came, the infanzona pulling on fitted leather gloves to help her on her way up. Up there she began to chat with Remund, one of her maids at her side to take up the bags the other one brought up.

With about half the work done, Brun was sent up with his own affairs and Song pulled from guard duty for the same at Isabel’s own suggestion. A courtesy, Angharad decided, meant, meant to soothe away the resentment the high-handed manners of the Cerdan had brought. Angharad went to keep Master Cozme company, less than interested in watching Augusto Cerdan pettily ensure that his own bags were brought up by the servants before his brother’s, and found him sitting on a stone as he kept an eye on the plains around them.

The lantern’s cast only went so far, but out here the lights of firmament lent an eye in a way they had not out in the woods. The cold light of cycling stars, those great Antediluvian wonders, shone like handfuls of diamonds sown in a sea of dark. Yet for all their beauty it was the crescent bite of the southern moons, slices of Glare bled out by faults in the machineries of firmament, that navigators set their courses by. Unlike the stars, they did not move with the passing of years – though unseen ebb and flows dictated the strength of their light.

“Almost done?” Cozme idly asked.

She glanced back.

“Still more than a third of the bags left,” Angharad said. “Mostly supplies. Lady Isabel’s bags were brought up first.”

Unsurprisingly, given that Lord Augusto had been deciding the order. He was still down there with the dark-haired maid and his valet, enjoying the exercise of authority.

“Of course they were,” Cozme Aflor sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “At least with Mistress Song up there we have-”

A shout interrupted him, both their gazes immediately drawn by the sound. Song was gesturing wildly, pointing to their left. Cozme was on his feet in a heartbeat, pistol drawn, and Angharad reached for her saber – yet there was nothing there. Was had the Tianxi seen?

“What in the Manes is she shouting about?” Cozme muttered, picking up his lantern.

Fiddling with the shutter to open it wider, he let out a curse when it jammed and began pulling at it. Song shouted again.

“-RUN!”

The shutter suddenly jerked open, light leaping forward and revealing a dazed lupine three feet away where there’d been thin air a heartbeat earlier. Angharad’s arm moved even as her mind froze, slicing through the lemure’s eyes. The creature whimpered, just before Cozme fired behind her and she turned just long enough to see another lupine’s brains splatter the grass. It was then she finally caught sight of them: strands of shadow on the green, slithering unseen towards them. She barely began to count before ceasing in blind dread: there were dozens, maybe even a hundred, converging from all sides. The Pereduri seized her panic before it could seize her, ripping the lantern out of Cozme’s hands.

He cursed, but she was already throwing it behind them. As the light whirled it ripped away the veil hiding the lupines behind them, dazing them for a moment as it had the others.

“Run,” she hissed, and they did.

She broke into a sprint, hacking blindly when something snapped at her heels, and saw Cozme’s wide-brimmed hat fly off when he turned to cut at burning yellow eyes. They were soon at the lantern she’d thrown, howls erupting behind them as the pack emerged from nothingness and ahead she saw one of Isabel’s maids going up the rings of solid light, the valet right behind her, screaming as she burned her hands in her hurry. The distraction cost her, Angharad’s foot slipping on the grass, but Cozme caught her arm and kept her standing. A shot sounded from the top of the aqueduct, the lantern behind them exploding in a ball of pale fire whose blooming light had the lemures yelping in pain.

They did not waste Song’s gift, running the last of the way hard enough their legs burned. Angharad almost slipped into the mud when she reached the ground by the last of the bags, supplies she knew they would have to abandon. Already Lord Augusto was climbing up his brother’s rings, shouting for his valet to hurry, and there was just enough room for another to begin going after him. Angharad and Cozme traded a look for a heartbeat, then she gestured for him to go. She would have slipped out there, if not for his help. That debt at least she could repay. She turned to face the onslaught, blade in hand, and breathed out slowly.

The light of abandoned lanterns laid out a ghostly ring for her, the darkness beyond just thin enough that when whatever greater power had veiled the lupines released its hold she saw the horde entire. A dozen slowly circling around her, eyeing the black ichor still staining her blade, and twice as many spreading around. She saw it then, the monster behind it all. She would have thought it a hill on the horizon, if it had not moved. Large as a carriage, the wolf-like lemure leaned heavily on its too-large front legs, the great maw seton its eyeless face filled with teeth like razor blades. The horror, though, did not lay there: it was covered in bulbous cysts and open wounds, trailing from all of them a foul black pus that the lupines came close to lick as if it were to them mother’s milk.

Shadow shivered down their fur when they did, melding them with the dark, and Angharad retched at the sight. Her disgust was forced aside when fear stole its place, her wandering gaze enough to incite the lemures to attack. The yellow-eyed monsters charged a dozen all at once, bone stingers rattling up a storm as they ran. Shots rang from above, downing two while the other balls missed, but Angharad kept her eyes on the enemy. Going still, she glimpsed ahead.

(It leapt up, tearing out her throat as another hamstrung her and the rest barrelled into her corpse)

Crouching down without missing a beat, she let the lupine fall into the mud as she carved through the muzzle of the one to her left. Pivoting on herself to rise back to her full height, she stole another glimpse.

(Claws into her back, snapping at her heels from behind, a mass like a tide tipping her over.)

Precision in all things, she told herself. So the wasp kills the lion. Measured movement, using her pivot to stumble back so the lupine clawing at her back instead stumbled into the one crawling out of the mud to bite at her heels. Hands high, shifting the weight so she could steal her footing back in time to slash at the muzzle of the first lupine in the tide. It was chaos after that, too fast and brutal for glimpsing. Claws tore at her side, through coat and shirt, and she smashed a skull with her saber’s pommel and hacked into another enemy’s flank. Another few shots from above, and another from closer: Cozme had reloaded while climbing.

And just as suddenly as it had come the tide withdrew, lupine corpses strewn all over the ring of light as the survivors fled back to the safety of the dark. Angharad, panting, felt the foul mixture of blood, sweat and ichor slide down her skin. Already another pack was gathering, and larger.

“Climb,” Isabel called out. “Before it is too late.”

Not eager for another melee she was unlikely to survive, the Pereduri moved towards the rings. She could tell immediately, though, that it wouldn’t be enough. Gascon was near the summit, but the valet had dropped the cloth that covered his hands and his fingers were covered with black burns, his eyes red with tears. Lord Augusto had half-climbed with him but couldn’t go ahead, not when the rings could not support the weight of two men, and though Angharad could squeeze close to Cozme it would leave her a mere handful of feet above the ground. The lupines would drag her down in moments. Song shot her musket again, blowing up a lantern in a burst of pale flame to scatter the gathering pack.

Only two left.

“A rope,” Angharad shouted. “Thrown down a rope, we’ll climb up the side.”

“Then they’ll stop shooting to cover us, you fool,” Augusto shouted.

But Brun, the God bless him, listened to her instead of the Cerdan. Within moments he was dangling a rope off the edge, and though it would need a leap to catch it Angharad would not miss. She glimpsed, saw herself falling short, and adjusted the angle. She had as many chances as she would need.

Song shot again, another lantern buying them precious time.

“Shit,” Cozme swore, looking back. “The large one is coming. Can the rope handle both of us?”

If that creature came, Cozme wouldn’t be high enough for safety either.

“Isabel,” Angharad screamed. “You and your maids, help Brun.”

Four people on the rope, would it be enough? They would have to risk it.

“It should,” Angharad said with certainty she did not feel. “I’ll go first, try to catch you.”

Another shot, the last lantern went and she breathed out. The light faded and the pack thundered against the ground, racing forward. Time to- there was a scream, above, and Angharad’s breath caught as she watched Augusto Cerdan twist the knife he had rammed into his valet’s back, throwing the weeping older man down. With a shout of triumph the infanzon climbed up to safety, Cozme close behind. Angharad looked back for a heartbeat, seeing a lupine’s jaw close around Gascon’s face, and felt something well up in her. She followed behind Cozme, the ring of lights winking out behind her, and though one of the lemures leapt up just in time to almost catch her boot she got away in time.

Few even tried to reach her, the pack falling on Gascon like ravenous hounds and tearing him apart.

Taking Song’s hand and letting herself be pulled up atop the aqueduct, Angharad let out a shaky breath. But she was not done, not yet. She wiped her blade clean on the side of her trousers and sheathed it, then turned her eyes on the knot of worried-looking infanzones. Even as the pack howled below them, prowling at the feet of the arches like hungry dogs, Angharad strode forward. Cozme caught the look on her face and moved in her way, but she sidestepped him and struck as hard as she could: her palm caught Augusto Cerdan on the cheek, hard enough he fell to the ground. She heard the cock of a pistol being pointed at her back but ignored him as everyone began to shout, unsheathing her saber.

As fury and fear warred over the eldest Cerdan’s face, she tossed the empty scabbard at his feet.

“Have you gone mad?” he began. “I’ll-”

“Augusto Cerdan,” she cut through with icy calm, “I name you a disgrace in the eyes of all who see, a coward without honour. Pick up this sheath and duel me once peril passes, or let your heart serve in its stead.”

The challenge was delivered in clean, crisp Antigua and laid out the two choices that lay before the craven traitor. He could either let her execute him for his deeds, here and now, or pick up the scabbard and accept a duel when they reached safety. Cozme still had a pistol pointed at her back, but Angharad did not flinch as she met the traitor infanzon’s dark eyes. She could not see behind her, where the honour of the others might have fallen, but the demands of her own were beyond dispute. A long moment passed, all their lives resting on the Sleeping God’s breath as the lupines howled all around, until finally Augusto Cerdan moved.

He picked up the sheath and the slower of his two deaths with it.

It was an old road, nibbled at by the elements the way crabs would nibble at a corpse, but it had held up well.

Enough so their pace across the plain was swift even though two of their crew were old. Vanesa was in better shape than Francho, whose cough resurfaced with often, but Tristan would still bet on the toothless old man in a fight: she’d candidly admitted that without her spectacles she might as well be blind. In truth, the thief thought, it was all going a little too well. According to Vanesa’s pocketwatch it was now slightly past midday and they’d seen neither hide nor hair of a lemure. Where Tristan was growing restless, though, most the others were growing lax. The idle talk was proof as much.

“Mad to think there’s a road here in the middle of nowhere,” Aines said, shaking her head. “Who even built it?”

Yong had taken the front and Lan the back – the grieving twin was in no mood for company – but the rest of them were haphazardly arranged somewhere in between. It felt more like they were on an evening stroll than the dangerous journey they truly were, but there was no point in trying discipline this lot. Twice now Yong and Tristan had tried to prod people into a proper column only for the effort to collapse within a quarter hour as people drifted wherever they wanted. They might be the fittest of the band, along with Sarai, but their authority ran thin.

“Some emperor,” her husband shrugged, scratching his arm. “I expect the infanzones would know which, what with Sacromonte being the old capital.”

Francho snorted, earning himself an unfriendly look.

“Something funny, old man?” Felis asked.

“Sacromonte was a regional port, never the Second Empire’s capital,” Francho informed him. “That honour belonged to Liergan first, then to Tamaria after the Vituperian Crisis and-”

Felis loudly gathered up saliva and spat to the side, straight into the tall grass. It would have been hard to miss given that it reached up to his shoulders.

“You’re full of shit,” Felis said. “Everyone knows Sacromonte was the jewel of the old empire.”

“One always blinks first when staring down the blind,” Francho sighed, then rasped out a cough.

Though he had no horse in this race, the thief stepped in. Best not let this turn into too much of a squabble.

“That’s from Chabier, isn’t it?” Tristan asked, cocking his head to the side. “One of his Historical Reflections.”

The old man nodded, beaming his way.

“Not the most dutiful of historians, but he had a way with words,” Francho said. “Did you study his work?”

Lan let out a harsh bark of laughter from the back.

“Does he look like a student to you, old man?” the blue-lipped woman mocked.

“I did read the two of the volumes,” Tristan evenly replied, “but never could get my hands on the rest.”

Gifts from his teacher, who had curated most of his readings by dint of being the one providing him the books. It’d been his mother who taught him to read and write, his father never having the time, but past that his education had largely been born of Abuela’s largesse. It was accordingly full of holes, as she only appeared infrequently and was uninterested in most of what would be considered common scholarship, but he’d found the eclectic nature of what he’d learned had its uses. Knowing both a little less and a little more than you should had a way of making you difficult to predict.

“The last three of the ten are only in print in the Kingdom of Izcalli,” Francho told him. “Even when I taught at Reve I could not obtain copies.”

Tristan started in surprise and he was hardly the only one.

“You were a Master at the University of Reve?” Sarai slowly asked, as if disbelieving.

Much like him, she must be wondering what such a learned man would be doing on the Dominion of Lost Things. Even if Reve’s other Masters decided to throw him out, half the infanzones in the city would be squabbling to bring him into their household as a tutor. The university might be adjoined to Sacromonte but it was not within its bounds, so the scholars were not beholden to the infanzones: they could not simply be ordered to teach feckless noble youths.

“Of moral philosophy,” Francho confirmed, “though I’ll confess I always preferred history. I parted ways with the university after I had some disagreements with our rectoress over a matter of scholarship.”

“I’m sure it had nothing at all to do with those books you paid the blackcloaks with,” Lan said, thinly smiling. “From the Reve library, were they?”

The old man reared up in offence.

“I am not a thief,” Francho hissed back, “I-”

He broke down into a wet hacking cough, which was when Yong found Tristan’s eye. Without saying a word the former soldier made himself clear: this was getting too loud. The thief inclined his head towards Lan, volunteering to handle her and getting a nod back. He let himself lag, casually joining the lone sister at the back. The Meng-Xiaofan twins had been impeccably groomed when they first came onto the Bluebell, their blue robes freshly cleaned and their City trousers without so much as a crease, but that was long gone. The clothes were rumpled, Lan’s blue-tinted lips cracked from weeping and the side of her head, once shaved to contrast with the ponytail, was now thick with stubble. She kept a veneer of sneering calm but the look in her eyes reminded Tristan of broken glass.

“Come to chide me, Tristan?” Lan smiled. “I must have been a bad girl indeed.”

“You’re stirring the pot,” Tristan said. “I’ll not gainsay grief-”

“How kind of you,” Lan harshly cut in.

“- but that ends now,” he quietly finished. “We can’t afford to be bickering.”

They had been lucky enough to avoid lemures so far, his trick with the lodestone extract having worked better than he’d dreamed it might, but with every step they got further away from the source of that luck. It was only a matter of time until monsters or cultists found them but he would not hurry that inevitability by making a racket in the middle of an open road. He was not sure how well tall grass would swallow sound and unwilling to bet on such steep odds.

“Big strong man you are,” she smiled. “Are you going to point your pistol at me now?”

“No,” the thief calmly replied, meeting her eyes.  “I am going to beat you unconscious, then cut up your leg so you can’t catch up and the blood draws lemures off our trail.”

She began to laugh in his face, but as she studied it the sound trailed off and she swallowed. She’d found the truth he had let onto there: he meant every word. He owed her a debt for her aid back in camp, when the crowd had been close to turning on him, but that had its limits.

“The others-”

“Have nowhere else to go, even if they disapprove.”

Lan licked her cracked lips.

“You owe me,” she said.

“I am not a student, it is true,” Tristan affably replied, “but I am not Malani either. How much do you think debt is worthto me, Lan? Enough to risk my life?”

They both knew the answer to that so the woman straightened in alarm, her anger swallowed up by much more immediate fear. Good. Now time to see what he could squeeze out of her while she was on the backfoot.

“I’m still useful to you,” Lan said.

“It’d been days and Felis hasn’t gone into withdrawal,” Tristan acknowledged, “so you must have dust hidden away. That makes it useful, not you. Try again.”

She flinched at the unspoken reminder that Angharad Tredegar was a long way from here and none of this crew would care to play the hero for her sake. Lan’s possessions were only her own so long as no one cared to take them from her. The former Meng-Xiaofan frontwoman grit her teeth.

“I know things,” she finally said. “Ju and me, we looked into other people.”

Tristan cocked an eyebrow, expectant.

“That Song girl that went with the infanzones, her surname Ren and she’s from Jigong,” Lan revealed.

She stopped there, as if it were supposed to mean something to him.

“At that means?” he invited.

She sighed.

“That she’s cursed,” Lan said. “Her family clan is responsible for the Dimming.”

It took a moment for him to place what that was.

“The Luminary that got broken a few decades back?” he asked.

Lan rolled her eyes, nodding in confirmation.

“Rats,” she complained. “Always going around like Sacromonte’s the heart of the world.”

Tianxia was one of the wealthiest lands of Vesper not only because of trade but also because of its great grain fields, which were bathed in light even hundreds of miles away from the cities. The machinery behind that miracle was called the Luminaries, great mirror-conduits set in firmament that connected the Glare to towers at the heart of the founding republics of Tianxia. Only there were nine Luminaries and ten republics, so every five year a lottery was held to determine which republic would go lightless. The Dimming had been disaster enough to warrant discussion around other shores of the Trebian Sea because somehow the Republic of Jigong had damaged one of the mirror-conduits up in firmament, bringing the number of functioning Luminaries down to eight.

Jigong had been refused the right to win the lottery ever since, consigned to the dark.

“It would have happened before she was born,” Tristan pointed out.

He was not clear on the year of the Dimming, but it was at least three decades past and Song Ren looked hardly older than he.

“Half the functionaries in Jigong cursed the Ren after the Dimming happened,” Lan snorted. “That means hundreds of gods and the kind of hate that’ll flow down a bloodline.”

It was the thief’s turn to roll his eyes. Cathayan Orthodoxy was famously superstitious, the inevitable consequence of letting gods take the examinations that elevated one into the ruling bureaucracy of the republics. Lock a Tianxi’s door and they’ll blame nine gods, the old saying went.

“Song Ren is bad luck,” he shrugged. “Fine. That’s all you have?”

Lan scowled, her pride obviously pricked by his indifference.

“That Asphodel noble, Acanthe, her contract has something to do with corpses,” she said.

That got his attention and he didn’t bother to pretend otherwise. He’d chatted with Acanthe Phos for some time without ever getting a hint of what she might be keeping up her sleeve.

“What did you find?”

“We looked inside her bag on the Bluebell,” Lan said. “She has small box with bones in it, broken shards and some thin needles.”

It couldn’t be only that, he thought, else Lan would have said the contract had to do with bones and not corpses. Thinking back on Acanthe’s actions since she’d left the ship, only one stood out to him as unusual.

“She was gathering corpse-ash from the pyres, wasn’t she?” he asked. “When she nosed around them with the rest of Tupoc’s crew.”

The former Meng dealer narrowed her eyes at him.

“Scooping it up with her bare hands,” Lan said. “You were looking into her too?”

“Tupoc, but it drew my eye,” Tristan admitted.

She nodded in agreement, then shot him a sideways look.

“That’s enough to prove I’m worth the trouble, I’d say,” she stated.

“You have more,” Tristan guessed, and by the closed look on her face he was right.

“And I’ll be keeping it, in case we must have another of these pleasant chats,” Lan evenly replied.

He might be able to get a little more if he twisted her arm over it, Tristan decided, but it was not worth burning down the bridge for good. This would have to be enough.

“You’re worth the trouble,” the thief conceded.

Her triumphant look never quite got to bloom.

“So long as you lay off making it,” he finished.

He left her to mull on that, putting a spring to his step so he might catch up to the others. Tristan was of a mind to head to the front and speak with Yong, as they’d been on the walk for half a day now and a better plan than fleeing forward was due, but alas that was not to be.

“I’m bored,” Fortuna announced.

She was staying at his side without bothering to pretend she was walking, a sight highly uncomfortable to his eyes. It felt wrong, as if the world itself were an illusion he was glimpsing through. It was something the goddess was well aware of and frequently used to screw with him whenever she felt like things were getting too dull. She wasn’t walking the wrong way for the one she was advancing yet, at least, which was a relief. That gave him a headache every bloody time.

“I’m a little low on choices for entertainment here,” Tristan murmured, pretending to scratch his hair. “What do you want?”

“Go bother Sarai,” Fortuna immediately suggested. “She’s amusing.”

At least it wasn’t one wedded pair she’d taken to, thank the gods for that. Other gods only, because he refused to give Fortuna any form of gratitude for a lesser shade of being a pain in his ass. Giving the goddess a measuring look, Tristan decided she was in one of those moods best left untested. Sarai it was. The false Raseni was near the head of the pack, chatting with Vanesa, but the old woman glanced his way with a smirk when he approached and made a show of leaving them to talk alone. She was misreading this quite deeply, but he saw no need to correct her when the misunderstanding was to his advantage. It was hard to tell if Sarai had noticed, under the veil and mask, but he suspected not.

According to the dark sweat spots around the armpits and back of her thick grey dress, she should be a mite distracted.

“How many layers do you have under there?” he snorted. “It’s not that warm out.”

Trebian weather, as it was called, cool enough for a coat in the wind but punishing the heavier fashions outside of it.

“This entire forsaken sea is a boiling pot,” Sarai growled back, that faint accent touching her voice again. “It is a miracle the Raseni aren’t all dried up husks, wearing as much as they do.”

“The weather’s cooler around their island, I hear,” he said. “Regretting the disguise?”

“It doesn’t get in my way when I move, it is only the heat that’s trouble,” Sarai sighed. “It will keep.”

“Or you could take it off,” Tristan said. “I’ve no idea what you are trying to hide, but is there truly anyone here worth hiding things from?”

He gestured around them, valiant alliance of leftovers that they were.

“You’re right,” Sarai said.

“I am?” he replied, somewhat surprised.

“You do have no idea what I’m trying to hide,” she pointedly replied.

Fortuna cackled loudly in his ear, sadly getting her bargain’s worth after having been a pest. Still, it would not do to let himself be trampled too thoroughly.

“A smidge above none, I’d argue,” he shrugged. “You’ve just admitted you were not born to a shore of the Trebian Sea.”

She shot him a steady look through the mask. Ah, hadn’t noticed that had she?

“You don’t sound Malani,” he continued, “so my guess would be the Imperial Someshwar. Somewhere inland, or maybe one of the peoples on the Tower Coast?”

The end was pure fishing and that veil gave nothing away. The eyes, though, betrayed not a whit of concern. He’d missed the mark.

“You dig so eagerly for others’ secrets,” Sarai chided, “but you ought to look better after your own.”

“Secrets? There are none, I am as an open book,” Tristan brazenly lied. “Ask me anything.”

She studied him for a moment, then shrugged.

“If you insist,” Sarai said, then leaned closer. “Who paid you to kill the Cerdan brothers? I figure it’s some infanzon trying to get at Ruesta.”

Fortuna oohed gleefully as his blood went cold, that horribly uncomfortable feeling of having been seen through seizing him by the throat again, so the rat smiled wide and bright to hide it.

“You misunderstand me, my friend,” Tristan replied.

“Do I?” Sarai teased.

How much did she know? Had she only noticed a coincidence and gone fishing, as he had? Yong wouldn’t care about his killing Recardo, he’d been open enough to the idea, but the former soldier might not be as eager to have the infanzones as outright foes. And if Tristan lost the veteran, he lost this crew: standing alone he would have no authority to assert. Sarai must know this but she was not threatening him or trying to leverage it. Either she didn’t know as much as she was implying or she simply did not care. Not from the shores of the Trebian Sea, he reminded himself. Did she simply care nothing for petty squabbles so far from her home? His silence was beginning to stretch on for too long, but indecision stilled his tongue.

“Take the bet,” Fortuna whispered against his ear. “She’s got even hands, Tristan. She gave you measure for measure every time.”

His goddess could be a fool in many ways, he knew, but sometimes her eyes saw true. Sarai had been scrupulously even-handed in their every bargain, giving as good as she received. If he gave trust… It went against his every instinct, the lessons of the years he had spent alone with only fickle fortune as his companion. When someone has a knife at your throat, Abuela had taught him, you must either destroy or befriend them. And if he’d learned anything from Fortuna, it was that sometimes the long odds took the prize. Swallowing thickly as he came to a decision, mouth gone dry, Tristan put on a winning smile.

“You do,” he firmly said. “Me, an assassin? Perish the thought.”

Sarai snorted, but the mirth caught in her throat as he continued speaking.

“No one paid me, so more accurately speaking I would be a murderer.”

She choked on that, though the surprise did not silence her for long.

“Are you telling me,” Sarai got out, “that you are not even gainfully employed?”

“I’m afraid not.”

“You are a deep disappointment, Tristan,” she solemnly informed him. “I thought you a man of means.”

“Alas, I have but methods,” he confessed.

She let out a quiet, delighted laugh at that. Something like a smile tugged at his own lips, the thrill and relief of the long odds having borne true tingling against his scalp. And maybe more than that. How long had it been since he’d found it so easy to talk to someone?

“Are you going to tell me why?” Sarai idly asked.

“Are you going to tell me your real name?” he idly replied.

“I thought Sacromontan men were titans of gallantry,” she complained.

He could hear the pout.

“That’s the Malani,” he informed her.

“Of daring, then.”

“The Izcalli.”

“… charm?”

“Tianxi,” Tristan drawled, “and if you think I do not have a ready triteness for every corner of Vesper then you’ve obviously spent little time in the company of sailors.”

“See?” she enthused. “Such a wealth of worthlessness, you are not entirely destitute after all!”

He swallowed a grin, somehow certain she was doing the same under the veil. And as he had given trust, he was given trust in return.

“There will be a need for a plan soon, if we are to keep this band together,” Sarai said. “I have something that might be of use for that purpose.”

He cocked an eyebrow at her.

“Song Ren has a map of the island in her possession,” the false Raseni said. “I traded for a good look at it.”

Tristan breathed in sharply.

“How good is your memory?” he asked.

“Good,” Sarai said, “not that it matters.”

She met his gaze squarely.

“There is a Sign that allows one to seize a sight and keep it nestled inside your mind.”

Measure for measure, Fortuna had said, and the golden eyes saw true. That was the secret Sarai had been keeping up her sleeve, the reason she carried for weapon only a knife. Like Leander Galatas she had knowledge of the strange arts of the Gloam, only unlike the sailor she’d kept that talent carefully hidden. He nodded slowly, acknowledging the worth of the secret she had revealed. The sudden seriousness of that after their easy repartee left him strangely embarrassed, as if he’d spoken too loudly near a grave, so he left on the pretext of speaking with Yong about arranging a break. Sarai inclined her head as he left, almost solemnly, and he returned the gesture.

It felt like a promise, though of what he did not yet know.

What he’d meant as an excuse ended up being true, as Yong pointed out both Felis and the greyhairs were beginning to slow down. A halt to eat and rest while a proper plan was put together would be good for everyone. Half an hour later they found a decent resting place, a smattering of ruins by the wayside of the road. It was short walk into tall grass to reach them, the stalks parting to reveal half-buried stone. What Tristan thought might be a curved roof rose from the earth in a gentle slope, a set of statues now little more than worn stumps circling around it. The roof made for a comfortable seat, and from the highest edge he could see the tall grass spread around them.

He got to hear the married pair argue as well, Aines and Felis unaware that their decision to head behind the roof to argue left him a dozen feet above them and just out of sight.

“- on our own,” Felis was insisting. “I just need to do Lan a few favours, she’ll fork out supplies for us and-”

“You mean she’ll give you dust,” Aines bit out. “Don’t think I haven’t noticed, Felis.”

“You’re one to talk,” her husband harshly replied. “How long was it on the boat before you were gambling?”

“If I’d won-”

“You never win,” he hissed. “How do you think we ended up here?”

“How?” she hissed back. “I’ll tell you how: your uncle threw you out after you pawned his tools so you could pay for another packet to lick up.”

“I’m not the one who played dice with the kids’ bed as collateral, Aines,” he growled. “Just the one who had to tell them why they slept with their blankets on the fucking floor.”

“I’m not leaving the others,” Aines abruptly said. “Talk all you want, that’s how it is.”

“We’d have a better chance on our own,” Felis cursed. “You know it. It’s some boy and the Tianxi calling the shots, they’re bound to fuck it up. You and I, though-”

“Why do you want me to go so much, Felis?” Aines quietly asked. “What did they tell you in that room, when they split us up?”

A silence.

“What did they tell you, that you won’t trust me anymore?”

Bought seats both of them, Tristan recalled. Whoever it was that owed their debt was playing what Yong had called a red game, one of those vicious wagers the twins had also warned him about. Whatever that wager might be, it was making an ugly situation even uglier. They can’t be relied on for anything, he decided. A way to shore up their numbers at best, but most likely a long fuse lit before they ever set foot on the Bluebell. He might have eavesdropped more if they’d kept talking, but Yong called for everyone gather at the foot of the roof. Tristan scarfed down his rations then hurried down, bringing his waterskin with him.

Before he’d gone up to eat he’d quietly conferred with Yong and Sarai. The two were now before the others as had been discussed, the former soldier standing while Tristan’s other ally crouched to draw in the earth with a twig. It was a rough sketch, but with the lantern set besides it the thief could easily make out the shape of the island and where they were: a straight line from the docks where they’d landed, a quarter of the way to the second trial up in the mountains. Ahead of them lay woods and a river, across which there were two bridges: one was fed into directly by the road, the other stood further east. The only other line through was the High Road, the aqueduct going straight across half the island, but its arches would make poor anchors for a rope bridge.

Tristan joined the other two in front, waiting until Francho finished lowering himself to the edge of the maybe-roof gingerly. He looked to be in some pain, enough that the thief considered offering him something for it before they began marching again. Belladonna extract, perhaps, properly diluted with water.

“As you can see,” Yong addressed the others, “we have made good time but it will be days before we get anywhere near the Trial of Ruins.”

“How do we know the drawing is accurate?” Lan asked.

“It’s a copy of the map the infanzones will be using,” Sarai replied. “They would not settle for anything less.”

Mutters of agreement. Some looked liked they wanted to ask how she might have gotten that, but none quite dared with the two of them flanking her. Which had been the very point.

“So we just need to rush in a straight line until we get there,” Felis shrugged. “Seems easy enough.”

“That won’t work,” Tristan said, ignoring the man’s scowl. “The blackcloaks told us that the cultists of the Red Eye will be out in force, they’re bound to be keeping watch on the main bridge. We’d be walking straight into an ambush.”

“That scarred Malani led her band towards the road north,” Francho noted. “She seems to believe it might work.”

“We don’t know if they stayed on that path,” Sarai pointed out.

“Even if they do, they’ve got powder and blades enough to fight through,” Lan said. “They’re all armed and trained, greyhair. We wouldn’t do anywhere as well in a fight.”

She paused.

“Besides, we’ve got more than the hollows to worry about,” she continued. “Tupoc Xical’s going to be on the hunt.”

Tristan’s eyes narrowed and Yong’s face turned grave.

“And how do you know that, exactly?” the former soldier asked.

“Because my sister and I offered him dirt on half of you in exchange for getting us safely to the second trial,” she admitted without a hint of shame. “He turned us down without a moment’s hesitation. Why do you think that is?”

Half a dozen answers bloomed on half a dozen faces, but the truest one passed lips first.

“Because he doesn’t think we’ll live long enough to be worth knowing anything about,” Vanesa quietly said, taking off her spectacles to clean them with her chemise.

She spoke with a tired certainty, like someone the world had already let down so many times she could no longer even muster anger over it. Aines laughed nervously, the sound shrill.

“You’re mad,” she said. “What would be the point? It’s not like there are limits to how many people can get to the second trial. It doesn’t help him to kill us, it’ll just slow him down.”

“Unless,” Tristan quietly said, “it’s not really about us. It’s about what he can buy with us.”

He found the lone twin’s eyes and matched her gaze.

“That’s what you think, isn’t it Lan? That he wants to sell us to the Red Eye cult in exchange for the right to get to the second trial unhindered.”

“It’s what fits,” the Meng frontwoman replied. “Why he gathered only a small crew, why he doesn’t think anyone is worth bargaining with: he already has another deal in mind, one that doesn’t involve fighting the Red Eye.”

“That’s nonsense,” Felis snorted. “You’re all fretting like hens over nothing. The boy won’t pull any of this shit: the blackcloaks would toss him out of the trials if he made a bargain with savages.”

“No rules, Felis,” Sarai reminded him. “Only survival.”

“The Watch has a long history of striking deals with darklings against other darklings,” Francho stated, worrying his lip. “A necessity, when their duties take them so far from the light of the Glare. They might even approve.”

And Tristan’s teeth clenched because, when it got down to it, how hard could it really be for the Watch to drive the Red Eye off the island? The Dominion was wild, unsettled land but it was not so large an island that a two thousand men could not thoroughly clear it out over a few months. So why hadn’t they? Because these are testing grounds, the thief thought. Because they want to see if we can make bargains with darklings without getting burned, because the cruelty isn’t an accident it’s why they still use this island at all. Those who joined the Watch through the trials of were not sent to training camps, he’d heard, not drilled and lectured and pampered.

They were inducted straight into the ranks, a black cloak set on their shoulders, and Tristan was beginning to understand why.

“There’s only one thing for it,” Yong spoke up, cutting through the silence. “From now on we must keep off the road and take a route they won’t expect. Anything else means death.”

Too many enemies and in too many places, the thief thought. His instinct was to sneak through, to find the quiet way in, but this wasn’t Araturo District. He was not the rat here, knowing all the streets like the back of his hand, they were. They’d get caught before getting anywhere, and unlike back home it wasn’t like they could try to hide behind a brawl between the Hoja and – or could they?

“We head straight for the second bridge,” Tristan said. “Cutting through the tall grass and the woods.”

Eyes went to him.

“They may well expect us to avoid the main path,” Yong warned him.

“They’ll guard all the bridges anyway,” the thief said, shaking his head. “They have the numbers for it, Sarai and I figured it out.”

Their conversation by the docks was not so soon forgot.

“It is true,” she agreed, rising to her full height. “They should have a few hundreds warriors at least.”

“Gods be good,” Felis exclaimed, huffing. “Spare me the posturing. We haven’t so much as seen a hollow, how would you even-”

“Then what is the point of going for the eastern bridge?” Lan bluntly asked, cutting through.

The middle-aged man did not quite dare to glare at the woman holding his leash.

“The Watch captain called them the cult of the Red Eye, but are they really?” Tristan asked. “One entity, I mean. They are warbands, not an army. Like those taking the trials.”

“You believe they are divided as well,” Yong slowly said.

“They’re thiefcatchers from different inns, all after the same prize money,” the thief said. “They won’t share word or help each other. They are a cult, certainly, but why would it mean they’re all on the same side? Gods won’t bless them twice for the same sacrifice.”

“An interesting theory, to be sure,” Francho delicately said, “but only that.”

“No,” Sarai said, shaking her head. “He’s right. Think back to the outpost, the number of watchmen you saw. Captain Crestina said she lost half her command, so double it. How many does that make?”

“Fifty, maybe sixty men,” Aines said.

She got surprised looks for it and shrugged.

“I got curious before the captain arrived, wanted to see if there was anything to do to pass the time.”

Looking for soldiers to dice with, Tristan translated, she happened to suss out how many there were around.

“That’s not anywhere enough to defend their storehouses if two hundred hollows try an assault, no matter how poorly armed,” Yong noted. “Not with the treeline so close. That says the Watch garrison doesn’t expect them to come in great numbers.”

“So we rush to the eastern bridge,” Tristan repeated, “and then we hide.”

Lan let out a sharp little laugh, catching on quick as was her wont.

“Then when the warband guarding that bridge sees no one coming,” she said, “they’ll think we went to the other one. That their rivals got all the sacrifices.”

“So when they thin their numbers to go have a look, or leave outright,” Tristan leadingly began.

“We cross,” Sarai finished. “And run as fast as we can to the Trial of Ruins.”

That, he thought with a sliver of satisfaction, sounded like plan. Perhaps not the cleverest or the most intricate, but one that might just work. And though he could see that not all were convinced, that some thought it would get them all killed, no one spoke up against it. Not for love of what had been said, he thought, but for lack of anything better to offer. No one really believed that they could get to the other bridge quickly enough to avoid a fight.

And a fight they would lose, there was no doubt about that.

The crew broke up after, everyone splitting up to rest for the remainder of their break and see to their belongings. He went back up the roof to grab his bag, settling on the edge just the way Francho had earlier. Stretching out lazily, Tristan let out a groan. He was not used to such long walks. Thieving required endurance more mental than physical. He took one last drink from his waterskin and set about putting himself back together, pulling at the loosened strings of his woolen shirt. He shrugged on his jacket after, the long sleeves and knee-length reach betraying it was rat’s clothing even if the wool was dyed grey. Infanzones and the wealthy aping them preferred shorter sleeveless jerkins, deigning to wear long coats only when travelling. Some of the seams in the back were growing thin, Tristan noted as he tugged at the jacket. He’d had this one for two years and though he had been careful frequent use was wearing it down.

Grabbing his tricorn, still pleased at the find – he’d always liked the look of them on Malani seamen – the thief noticed Vanesa approaching him from the side. The old woman’s plain linen chemise and trousers were City staples from the Murk to the ports, but her red frock told him she had been someone of more than passing means. As did her glasses and pocketwatch, both worth several months of wages for a common labourer. That raised questions, as did the way that Vanesa sometimes seemed almost half-hearted in her attempts to get through the trials. What had forced her to the Dominion, if not desperation? There was a story there, should he care to dig for it.

“Extend your arm,” the old woman said, gesturing at his left.

Hiding his wariness, he did. She bent slightly forward and began patting down the back of his sleeve thoroughly.

“Dust and soot,” Vanesa told him after she finished. “Boys never think to look behind, my son is just the same.”

Not having been mothered in many years – Abuela might be old enough to be his grandmother, but her blood was colder than a crocodiles’ – Tristan was taken aback enough he struggled to find an answer. Coughing into his fist, he changed the subject.

“You have children?” he tried.

“Only the one,” Vanesa wistfully said. “You must be around sixteen, yes? He is twice your age now.”

“Eighteen,” Tristan drily replied. “I simply can’t grow a beard for the life of me.”

“My husband never could either,” she smiled at him. “Not for lack of trying.”

Dead husband but her son still lives, he filed away. Had she been abandoned to a debt from beyond the grave? Sacromonte’s debts laws were some of the harshest around the Trebian Sea – wife or husband shared in what the other owed, children in what their parents did and if property was shared even siblings could be dragged into the pit. Tristan was considering how best to ask what her trade had been without being too obvious about it when he was interrupted by a startled shout. Baring his knife, the thief turned to find it had been Francho making everyone jump. The old scholar was leaning against the side of the half-buried roof, a bare hand on the stone and his worn body trembling.

Finding no immediate danger, Tristan put away the knife. That scream, though… Chewing at the inside of his cheek, the thief grabbed his pistol and powder horn. No ball in it yet, but perhaps soon. There was no telling what the noise might have called down on them.

“What’s with the racket?” Felis called out.

Francho’s eyes rolled up in his head even as Tristan approached him, though he did not seem to be in pain. Before the thief could speak the old man snatched back his hand, neck glistening with sweat as he kept on shivering.

“We need to leave,” the old man said, then began wetly coughing into his hand. “Now.”

“Why?” Yong evenly said. “What did you do?”

“Contract,” Sarai said. “He used a contract.”

It was not a question.

“The stone,” Francho rasped out. “It speaks to me. Old voices. The stronger the memory, the louder.”

“And what did they say?” Tristan asked, dread welling up.

“There is an altar below,” the scholar said, voice shaken. “Sacrificial. And hollows live there.”

Aines screamed, and if she had not Tristan would have died. He turned to her, saw the men coming out of the tall grass but also the glint of steel in lantern light. An arrow, halfway to his throat, and all he could do was borrow luck. He drank swift and deep, the ticking loud as a scream, and saw the fletching on the arrow tear. It missed but only narrowly, splitting open his jacket as death spared him. Immediately he threw himself down as another arrow whistled above his head, gritting his teeth as he released the luck. He heard the click a moment too late, not quite quick enough to roll over when the pistol he’d loaded with powder blew up against his side.

Letting out a hoarse shout as he threw it away, patting away the burns that’d blown through his shirt, the thief swallowed a moan of pain and rose to his feet. Around him all Hell had broken loose.

Yong blew through a tall, pale man – pale as milk, beard and hair wild – with a shot before tossing way the musket, drawing his sword as a large man in chainmail hoisting an axe walked up to face him, but the others were not doing so well. An arrow had taken Francho in the side and while Vanesa had run to help him two hollows were coming for them bearing spear and mace. Another was in the tall grass, pulling back the string on her crossbow, though her eye was on… Lan, who was running out into the dark. There must be another, wielding the second crossbow, but Tristan saw no trace of them.

Should he run? No, it would just be a slower death. He would never make it across the bridges alone. Tristan drew his knife, still light-headed from the burns.

“Felis, Aines,” Yong shouted, eyes peeling away from his fight for a second, “silence the crossbow. Don’t let her fire again!”

No waiting to see if they would obey, Tristan rushed in. Not there but towards the greyhairs, just in time to see Vanesa being kicked down by a skinny man covered in a thick padded tunic. Tristan ducked under the swing of the other hollow, some leering bastard with big eyes, and the mace’s haft bounced off his side. Grimacing – that would bruise – he still slid his knife between the skinny hollow’s ribs. Or tried to, slipping against a metal plate under the tunic and slicing down closer to the kidney. He drew back as quick as he could, face growing grim. His chance had lain in getting rid of one from the start, now it was going to turn on him.

“Go,” Tristan shouted at the old pair, “I-”

He ducked out of the mace’s way again, the swing gone wide, but the other hollow struck true. The spear’s haft batted down on his shoulder, forcing him to his knees as he yelped. The thief palmed his knife, readying a throw, but the mace was swinging again and then there was a sound like a pop. Coolness brushed past his face as the cultist’s eyes went blank. His face, scarred with red ellipses – Red Eye, he thought – slacked and his swing dulled. Tristan backed away, rising to his feet as he aimed, while the spear cultist broke the other from his trance with a shove. Not quickly enough: the thief snapped his wrist, burying the knife to the hilt in the mace-wielder’s throat.

The other shouted in dismay, rushing with his spear, but even as Tristan drew the knife he’d claimed at the docks there was another soft pop. From the corner of his eye, the thief saw Sarai’s fingers clawing at the air in another Sign. He saw a flicker, too, and shouted out a warning just in time. She threw herself aside before the crossbow bolt could in impale her from the back and he felt a sliver of relief just in time for the no-longer-stunned cultist to ram into him shoulder first. Down Tristan went, flipped on his back, and only realized why he’d not just been run through when the hollow kept going towards Sarai. The Signs were more of a threat than a rat with a knife.

Teeth clenched, he scrabbled to his feet and leapt at the cultists’ back. They tumbled down together atop a shouting Sarai, who stabbed wildly at the hollow with her knife but sliced through only padding. Tristan tried to block the man’s arms, the three of them grinding like worms. The hollow was stronger than him, damn the bastard, and through the thief’s failing grip pinned Sarai’s hand. The cultist kept the knife down and gripped her throat as she struggled to trace a Sign on his face, Tristan abandoning the failed hold to gouge at the hollow’s eyes with his thumbs. The man screamed, loudly enough the thief did not hear the bolt whistling at him. Sheer luck saved his life when the cultist bucked him off before the shot could go through his chest.

The hollow threw himself away from them with a howl of pain, one hand on his now smoking face and the other clawing at Sarai’s face.

The darkling ripped off the veils and mask, revealing a face as pale as his own, and Tristan’s heart skipped a beat. He scrabbled to his feet again, pained and exhausted, just in time to see the hollow draw a long knife and – and die, Yong’s blade hacking halfway through his neck. The former soldier wrenched it out, pushing down the corpse with a kick, and swept their surroundings with a steady gaze. Yong looked completely unfazed, not a trace of dirt or sweat on him: only a few strands of his topknot had come undone. Tristan swallowed, rising to his feet as he looked around them. The married pair had killed the crossbow wielder they went after, at some cost. Aines had a growing black eye and Felis a broken bolt in his arm.

Yong’s own opponent, the big man wearing armour, was lying in a pool of his own blood.

“Darkling,” the Tianxi evenly said, watching Sarai.

“I am not,” she replied, warily rising to her feet.

Her hair was dark and long, Tristan saw, her eyes a paler shade of blue than he’d believed. It was an angular face she had revealed, its chin pointed and cheekbones high.

“What else could you be?” Aines nervously said. “Were you working with them this whole time, Sarai, is that why we’ve been ambushed?”

Tristan thought, then, of the conversation they’d had by the shore as the sailors took the crates out of the Bluebell. A sentence he’d thought innocent but might not have been at all. The Malani love to use trinkets up north, she’d said. Almost like she had been there, seen it with her own eyes. And she might not be Malani, but there were another people living in the far north.

“I don’t think she is,” Tristan said.

He looked around for his pistol, found it lying on the ground but a few feet away.

“She fought with us, almost died,” Vanesa agreed, clutching her ribs. “She could not have been working with them.”

“I mean I don’t think she’s a darkling,” the thief said, shaking his head.

He picked up his relic pistol, opening the secret compartment and revealing the piece of rhadamantine quartz. Its pale glow caught everyone’s eyes, including Sarai’s, and Tristan made a show of palming it. Meeting her gaze, he lightly tossed it her way. She caught it without batting an eye, then took off one of her gloves and set the stone against her naked palm.

The pale skin did not burn at the direct touch of the Glare.

“You are from the Malani colonies,” Francho spoke into the silence, sounding fascinated. “The lands under the Broken Gate.”

“I am,” Sarai conceded, “a very long way from home.”

“So you’re a slave,” Felis snorted. “What in the Manes are you doing trying to get into the Watch?”

By the look on Sarai’s face that talk might have gotten ugly, but Yong cut in before it could begin.

“She is no darkling, that’s all that matters,” the Tianxi said. “We’ve wasted enough time on this, we need to bind our wounds and go.”

“Gods, we need to rest,” Aines replied, appalled. “After all that? We beat them, we have the time.”

“No,” Tristan quietly said. “We don’t. Two crossbows fired and only one was silenced. Someone escaped.”

Which meant the cult of the Red Eye had found them, and if they did not run quickly enough they were all dead.

# Chapter 11

The sharp crack echoes against the stone, smoke billowing past the open door.

There is a grunt of pain but men still rush past the threshold: tall, becloaked, bearing blades. Mother bares her own, undaunted by the numbers, but a shot sounds from the back and she staggers. Red blooms on her chemise, deep in the belly, and she lets out a wet gasp before she is struck across the mouth. Angharad can do nothing but watch: her screams die in her throat, her limbs are made of lead. Mother falls against the wall, against the rich wood panelling she so loves, and when another shot takes her shoulder blood is splattered all over it. She falls to her knees, breath a rattle, and then the last man walks in. Tall, fat and with eyes cold as ice. He owns the others, they only watch as he raises his pistol. It was the wrong choice, Lady Maraire, he says. Mother rasps out an answer, but the words are drowned out by the roar of the flames. Smoke swallows everything.

Angharad woke with wet eyes, the way she always did after dreaming of her mother.

She could only be grateful that it had ended early this time, before her father’s whisper in her ear and the last of the horror. Her neck was beaded with sweat but she stayed there, lying in her cot, and tried to blot out from her mind the bloody, broken figure the nightmare had fixed in her mind. She hated it, that this was how she should remember Mother. Rhiannon Tredegar had been long and lean, like the crack of a whip made into a woman, with only green eyes softening a faced shaped stern by the Sleeping God’s own hands. There had been a presence to her, a severity demanding respect. That was the way Angharad would remember her, but her dreams did not bend to her wants. She could still see hear the thump of knees hitting the floor, the blood spraying on wood.

Angharad had thought the nightmares finally gone, having had none since Sacromonte, but she had counted her blessings too soon.

The noblewoman rose in her covers, unsurprised to find most were yet asleep. Only Song, perched at the edge of the aqueduct with a veiled lantern besides her, had woken for her turn on the watch. The Tianxi did not turn at the sound of someone waking, and in the privacy that afforded her Angharad wiped her eyes. Letting her breath even out, she passed a hand through her hair. The slant braids would keep for a week or two more, she thought, but soon they would need redoing. She almost missed when she had kept her hair shorter, in Malani knots, instead of braids going halfway down her back. Almost. She had let it grow out to celebrate the earning of her last mirror-mark and that much she would not let herself regret even out here.

Mother had been so proud, she remembered. Lady Rhiannon had been skilled with a blade but not a mirror-dancer, and the joy had been plain on her face that day. Angharad had basked in that pride, feeling that at last she added to her mother’s legacy in some small way. Rhiannon Tredegar had made a name sailing the dark seas, crossing waters which no Glare touched with only the trembling lights she had brought with her keeping darkness at bay. She had faced storms of Gloam and sea, the hatred of merciless spirits from the depths and even the fleets of pirates to emerge one of the great explorers of the age. It had been Captain Tredegar who first found the hidden isle of Lunkulu, who sailed through the perilous Western Canals and reached the lands beyond.

And now it was all smoke, Angharad bitterly thought. The Tredegar name passed into nothing while she scuttled like a rat in a maze for the pleasure of the Watch, debasing herself earn seven years under their protection. If she could even do that, the noblewoman grimly thought. Her eyes turned to the manner their company had lain down to sleep for the night and in the meagre light of Song’s lantern showed their divisions laid bare.

The Cerdan brothers lay furthest away from her, Cozme Aflor guarding them. Both now openly counted her an enemy. It was only the disgust of everyone else at the murder of their own valet that had kept Augusto from trying to order her killed. On the opposite side Angharad’s own cot lay with two others close, Brun of Sacromonte sleeping in one while Song’s lay empty. In between the two camps Isabel and her maids lay, bridge and moat. When Brun and Song had grown closer to her as the Cerdans revealed themselves honourless curs, Isabel had been forced to step in as peacemaker. She had prevailed on the brothers to respect Angharad’s truce, reinforcing that there would be no fighting until their company had left the throes of peril.  Yet, despite the infanzona’s efforts, the dark-skinned noblewoman knew this company to be a barrel of powder with a lit fuse.

And sooner rather than later it would blow up in her face.

Her mother’s lessons would avail her of nothing here. It had taken boldness for Rhiannon Tredegar to raise their house’s name and Mother displayed it in all things, so it had troubled Angharad all the more when Mother confessed to fearing the High Queen’s court. There is nothing to fear, she had insisted, childishly offended by her idol’s sudden weakness. The royal court had duels the way dogs had fleas, but Mother was a skilled blade and who but the finest of swordmasters could threaten her? Even if she offended some lofty izinduna, a grudge could not be pursued beyond the reasonable. The High Queen was the keeper of Malan’s honour and she did not allow any slight upon it. Sweetling, Mother had gently replied, stroking her hair, I would be dead long before my sword left the scabbard.

She had explained, then, how the duels that could lead to embarrassment never happened at all. Knives and poison and curses would settle it long before that, any difficulty on the way to earning the High Queen’s esteem ruthlessly snuffed out. Mother’s way to survive had been to remain a mere curiosity, a famed explorer kept in the court’s eye only by the High Queen’s favour and wielding no real power or influence. She had avoided the hangman’s noose that would be rising in station and remained at sea instead of playing courtier, too far to be counted as an enemy by the powerful of Malan. That had been a rude awakening for many a reason, among them that Angharad had known even then that she would not follow her mother out at sea.

Was she to let the name of Tredegar – Maraire, to the Malani, but blood ran true no matter the letters – fall back into obscurity when her mother passed? Mother had had no answer, and in the end it had been Father who soothed her.

“Your mother has mastered her fear of an unknown,” he told her. “That which lies beyond the Glare, the seas that devour ships and hopes. But pride blinds her to realizing she surrenders to all the other unknowns of Vesper, believing that courage against one is courage against all.”

He smiled then and though Gwydion Tredegar was never the tallest or most handsome of men, when he smiled Angharad had always thought her father outshone all rivals.

“You need not share her unknowns,” Father said. “Come, I will teach you so that you may learn and so knowledge may end fear.”

She had not loved his lessons but she had learned them, well enough that when standing among the sons and daughters of izinduna when tournaments took her to Malan she’d sailed those waters without falling afoul of the hidden reefs. And it was her father’s lessons she must call on again, now that honour had led her to make enemies of half the company she must fight alongside with to survive. Like a swordmistress at the High Queen’s court, she must ensure she’d live long enough to bare her blade. And the first step to that did not begin with her closest companions, not with Isabel or even Master Cozme.  Instead when they raised camp, not even an hour later, she made a quiet request of Isabel Ruesta.

The dark-haired beauty considered her for a moment, eyes intrigued.

“In a spirit of peace, I would hope,” Isabel asked.

Above them the stars burned cold, as they had for her forebears in distant Peredur. In the wind Angharad Tredegar thought she had caught the echo of their old shore-songs, story and lesson and question all in one. She almost began to hum the first few notes of The Fair Wife.

“Not to make enmity,” Angharad swore.

Love is sweet, a heady brew,

but my hand must be won fair

Sweet love, what will you swear 

as troth if your love is true?

When the trek north began anew she found herself walking at the back of their company, Lord Remund Cerdan besides her. To prove they were all still allies, Isabel had suggested. A gesture of goodwill. The youngest Cerdan moved warily, as if with every step he feared she might jump out and cut his throat. For all that, Angharad feared not getting from him what she desired. She knew what Augusto Cerdan wanted most of all, so she owned half his name.

“It is regrettable we are at odds, my lord,” she said, forcing a mourning sigh.

She did not lie: in all of Vesper, there must be a soul capable of such regret. The infanzon frowned at her, as if puzzled by her civility. The moment she had become his enemy, she divined, what little esteem he’d granted her before had disappeared. Now she might as well be some savage from Triglau, raiding colonists by the sea.

“You lay grave insult at the feet of House Cerdan,” Remund stiffly replied.

“An insult demands redress,” she said. “Yet is should be given where it is deserved, not carelessly offered to the unworthy.”

“And what would a Malani know of what is deserved?” the infanzon mocked, rolling his eyes.

“We may well have all died yesterday, if not for your contract,” Angharad said. “That is deserving.”

Of many things, let Remund Cerdan decide which without her help. The younger brother puffed up and for a moment Angharad felt sick. It might be that the man was so vain any praise at all went to his head, she thought, but she’d known other boys like him. Born to great families and stalking about with their knives ever bared, offended and offending, but so often beneath that there had been a wound. How starved of esteem must you be, that an enemy’s words are all it takes to straighten your back?

“It is good you recognize as much,” Remund drawled. “I thought you an ingrate, I don’t mind admitting it. It is said to be common flaw of your people that you take a mile whenever you are given an inch.”

“Malani are not without flaws,” she said. “I like to think ingratitude is not one of them.”

“Oh?” the young man smiled, eyeing her up and down. “Then how am I to be rewarded?”

She kept her face calm at the implied insult. He had no interest in her, not really. He was simply waving around his knife, hoping to score red on flesh.

“Honour is to be earned with one’s own hands,” Angharad said. “And it occurs to me than any lost by Cerdan hands could be regained by the same.”

Remund breathed in sharply, eyeing her with surprise and a different kind of wariness than before. He’d looked at her the way one might a wild beast, when this began, but now there was a different tint to it.

“You surprise me, Tredegar,” the infanzon murmured. “Perhaps you are not so dim after all. Such a thing could solve many problems at once, yes.”

She held her tongue, letting him stare at the pond until he found the reflection he was looking for.

“A duel to first blood to avenge my house’s honour,” he mused. “It is true a victory against a swordmistress would be the talk of the season, enough to avoid the ire of my lord father over Augusto’s unfortunate end.”

“One hopes,” Angharad said with measured precision.

Dark eyes narrowed at her.

“Getting Cozme out of the way so you have an opening would not be impossible,” Remund conceded. “But how can I be sure you’ll hold up your end of the bargain?”

“My word is my bond,” she flatly replied. “I will swear oath to it, should you prefer.”

The nobleman smiled, laying his palms against the back of his head as he strolled forward with a touch of unearned swagger.

“No,” Remund Cerdan finally said, smile widening.

Angharad hid her surprise, slowly inclining her head. She must have made a mistake, or perhaps underestimated the bonds of brotherhood.

“You gain much with this and me too little,” Remund idly added. “I require more of you.”

The sliver of respect she had been feeling died young.

“I am listening.”

He leaned close, too close, smiling still for all that his eyes were without mirth.

“This little dance of yours with Isabel, it is to stop,” Remund said.

Silence again, for no words were more persuasive than one’s own.

“She encourages you, no doubt,” the younger Cerdan shrugged. “It is her way. She enjoys the attention, and in truth I do not begrudge her that. Why marry at all, if your wife is not to be the envy of all your peers?”

The lie lay in the tight cast of his jaw as he forced the first not through his lips.

“But it irritates me, your flirtation,” Remund smiled. “I find tasteless the presumption that, even in jest, you could be the rival of an infanzon. So you will cease. Keep your distance from her.”

“You want an oath,” Angharad surmised.

“I do,” the dark-haired main jovially replied. “And one for our other bargain too. There will be no slipping out at the last moment, my friend.”

The words came easy to her, as if they had always lain on the tip of her tongue.

“On my oath, I will no longer seek the company of Isabel Ruesta,” Angharad said.

He sighed.

“I suppose no longer speaking to her at all is too much to ask,” Remund conceded. “And?”

He cocked an eyebrow, gesturing for her to get on with it. She chose the phrasing carefully, pruned away the right words and left them in the grass for him to find.

“On my oath, I will cede victory to you in an honour duel over Augusto Cerdan’s death in the same.”

Remund cocked an eyebrow at her, a hint of smugness to his mien.

“Speak it again,” he said, “only specifying my name instead of simply you. Let us not be careless with our words, yes?”

She did as asked.

Victory is poison to reason, my darling, Father had taught her. Once men have caught you out, they think themselves your better in all things. Remund Cerdan, for all that he despised his brother, thought him Angharad’s match with a sword even though he manifestly was not. It had not occurred to him that an honour duel could be to surrender as well as death, that she could simply wound the elder Cerdan to death’s very edge before allowing him surrender. And if Augusto Cerdan died after the honour duel, not during, then she owed his brother nothing at all. Lord Remund Cerdan smiled condescendingly at her, deigning to engage her in small talk now that she had become his tool, and under her breath she hummed the old tune.

I promise the stars in a cup

and the sea in your hand.

a hall reaching the clouds;

a hearth where hundreds sup

She had not turned the brothers against each other, that hatred had taken root long before she came into their lives, but now she had ensured they would not make common front against her. That would ensure Master Cozme was not easily made to act against her: he was beholden to both brothers and now one wanted her to live. At least long enough to be of use to him, not that Angharad believed he truly intended to hold up his end of their bargain. More likely than not he would try to use the vagueness she had purposely left in the phrasing – in an honour duel, not specifying one to first blood – to try and kill her by surprise during their bout. Victory at first blood would win him praise from his peers, but avenging his brother? Oh, it might well make him famous.

It did not matter. Snake or not, she knew half his name. He would not bite until he had obtained his heart’s desire.

Now she must prune away the other dangers, to ensure she made it to the hour where she would get her bargain’s worth. That began with seeing to her own back, ensuring that the companions she’d made would have no reason to turn on her. When their company halted for rest, she volunteered to join Brun at the front until the next halt. The Sacromontan seemed to appreciate the gesture, especially when she took it upon herself to carry the lantern. Their advance was smooth and almost pleasant, the High Road living up to its name: it was largely even ground, broken up only by where enterprising weeds had taken root in the stone. Most of their attention was not reserved for the path ahead, anyhow.

It was below that their eyes strayed, down into the plains they were soon to reach the end of. The lupines that had hunted them for the better part of yesterday were left behind when they crossed a deep gully unmarked on Song’s map, unable to cross, but there was no telling if the creatures had gone around to continue their pursuit. The spirits had not been able to do anything from below, but the incessant howling had frayed everyone’s nerves – and risked drawing in some greater spirit that would not be kept away by something as simple as the height of the aqueduct. So far they had glimpsed a few silhouettes creeping across the flatlands, but none ever came close enough to be lit up.

The infanzones, Angharad would admit, had hatched a very clever plan. If not for the misfortune of being set upon by the lupines the march all the way to the second trial might have gone without a single drop of blood spilled. She was not alone in that opinion.

“I am glad not to be walking the plains,” Brun told her. “I would find it difficult to lower my guard long enough to sleep down there, after that mess with the lemures.”

“Perhaps our misfortune will have helped the others,” Angharad said, though she did not truly believe it. “It would be some small solace.”

“I suppose there is need for all of that we can find, these days,” Brun drily said.

She grimaced.

“I regret that our company has become at odds,” Angharad said. “And know I played a part in it.”

The fair-haired man dismissed her words with a wave of the hand.

“I’ll not quibble with ruthlessness, not on the Dominion of Lost Things,” he said, “but you were right to strike the man. It would have been a fool’s act to let the Cerdans murder one of us without consequence.”

His face darkened.

“Infanzones already dispose of lives too easily for my tastes,” Brun said. “I would not encourage the habit.”

It was uncomfortable hearing him speak of his rightful rulers in such a way, but she must admit that the disrespect might not be unwarranted. Not for all infanzones, for while Sacromonte’s nobles were shadows of what they had once been they were still of noble blood, but she would not deny the Cerdan brothers were not living up to the duties of their privilege. It was a failure that reflected badly on their kin, who should have properly educated them to the responsibilities of rank.

“You do not sound fond of them,” Angharad tried.

“I am the son of miners,” he said. “Theirs was not a pleasant life, Lady Angharad, and it was spent enriching the same kind of men as these Cerdan.”

“I’m sorry to hear of their passing,” she gently said.

“It has been years,” Brun shrugged.

The calm on his face she could hardly understand, for the grief she felt over her parents would surely be a wound in her side until she died. She could not think of anything but vengeance that would lessen it even slightly.

“Some are better than others,” he continued. “Lady Isabel seems decent enough.”

He shot her a knowing look at that.

“She has been very kind,” Angharad stiffly replied.

“Briceida tells me she’s decided not to withdraw after the first trial,” Brun told her.

She did not hide her surprise, at both the words and the implication that one of Isabel’s handmaids would gossip about her mistress’ affairs in such a way.

“Was this ever in doubt?” she asked.

If so, it was news to her. Isabel had never hinted as much, though it was true she had spoken little of her plans.

“She hesitated after learning her cousin had died,” he said. “Did she not speak of it with you?”

Angharad shook her head.

“Perhaps she worries of your safety,” Brun idly said. “Without her mediation, our troubles with the Cerdan would only grow worse.”

It would be foolish, she chided herself, to think Isabel would risk her life for her when what lay between them was but a flirtation. The thought still brought a pleasurable flush to her cheeks.

“Or she recovered from the shock and stuck to her course,” Angharad said.

Brun did not look convinced. He must be quite the romantic, she decided with a swell of fondness. How long before the lingering glances between him and the redheaded handmaid – Briceida – turned into something more? How scandalous. Still, it gladdened her that some happiness was being born out of these trials no matter how passing it might be.

“Whatever the truth of it, she is a good friend to have in our corner,” he said. “I hope that your avoidance of her company during our halt was not a cooling in relations.”

Angharad’s lips thinned. Brun studied her, then slowly nodded.

“Not so, I see,” he said. “Does perhaps your talk with Remund Cerdan have something to do with this?”

Speaking of an oath sworn in secret without the permission of he it was sworn to came too close to dishonour for comfort. Angharad kept silent, but denied nothing.

“He does seem like the more jealous of the two,” Brun grunted. “Maybe enough to get an oath.”

The blond Sacromontan shot her a piercing look.

“I wonder,” he said, “how someone might describe the way you acted during our halt.”

Angharad beamed down at him. What a clever man.

“I did not seek the company of Isabel Ruesta,” she very precisely replied.

Describing something that had been done in public could not be taken as revealing a secret, after all. Brun snorted, scratching the blond stubble on his chin.

“Were that an oath, it’d be one with a hole wide enough to sail a ship through,” he said. “All it’d take was someone figuring it out and passing on the wording to the object of the terms.”

“It would be a clever and convivial soul who did such a thing,” Angharad replied, lowering her head in gratitude.

Brun smiled.

“Might be I’ll help Lady Isabel’s girls carry her bags this afternoon,” he said. “I imagine it’s the kind of thing she might thank me for in person, sweet as she is.”

Her head lowered even further. Were they not journeying through a dark isle that was the roost of darklings and evil spirits, Angharad might have found the entire affair all strangely romantic: a binding oath to a rival, clever servants passing messages between star-crossed lovers and a duel with another rival on the horizon? She must have read half a hundred plays that had all of these. As it was, little about this made her heart flutter. It felt much like walking a tightrope instead.

“If could have a reassurance, first,” Brun quietly said. “Should this turn ugly, should the brothers and their minder come for us, will your… talent be enough to tip the scales?”

The pause made it plain what it was he was asking of: her contract. Though it was most tactless of him to inquire, as one did not simply ask about these things, she did owe the man. Or would soon enough.

“I have killed more than three men in a day,” Angharad simply replied, then chose her words carefully. “My hand moves faster than it ought to.”

Not a lie, though the implication was. It sat ill with her to deceive Brun even by implication when he had been such a loyal companion, but that decision she had made before ever leaving Malan. It could not get out that the Fisher had given her the gift of foresight, else returning home would forever be barred to her. The blond man nodded at her in understanding. To her surprise, he then offered a revelation of his own.

“I can sense the living,” he told her. “People best, hollows and beasts with more difficulty.”

Her brow rose.

“A great gift,” she said.

There would be more to it, and neither had even obliquely referred to a price, but she was still moved by the display of trust. It spoke well of the man’s character that he would acknowledge and mend his indiscretion immediately. It made her even more of a wretch to be fooling him, a truth she found hard to swallow. She was not used to answering kindness with such faithlessness.

Wed me, be my fair wife

And these will all be yours

I swear this on my life

And the life that will be ours

The next step came slightly past midday, after they stopped to eat and once more changed the arraignment of the column. Angharad would have sought out Song, finished securing her back, but when Cozme Aflor instead offered for the two of them should take the rearguard she agreed without hesitation. He, too, was a danger that must be settled. Master Cozme was a skilled and loyal retainer charged with keeping both Cerdan brothers alive: so long as Angharad was a threat to their lives, the risk remained that he would attempt to kill her. It might not be honourable, but some might argue that a servant’s true honour lay in choosing the fulfillment of duty over their own virtue. As the older man had been the one to approach her, she chose to let him lead the conversation.

“I’ll not defend what was done to Gascon,” Master Cozme briskly said. “It was ill-done and ill-advised. The boy was scared, but that’s no excuse.”

He looked uncomfortable. Without the large hat pairing with the long hair and grey-flecked beard, he was not quite as roguish – despite his obvious care for his appearance, he was looking a little haggard.

“And no excuse was given,” Angharad said.

Lord Augusto Cerdan had not so much as shed a tear over the killing, as far as she could see.

“He can’t do that, not after you struck him,” Cozme replied. “It’d be an admission of weakness now, that he is beneath you. A ruthless man won’t be loved, but he can be respected.”

He thumbed his moustache.

“A weak man will have neither love nor respect.”

Angharad cocked an eyebrow at him.

“What is this if not a defence, Master Cozme?” she asked.

He spat over the edge of the aqueduct. His hand was hooked into his belt, as if he were on a casual stroll, but that seeming carelessness left it never too far from his pistol.

“Acknowledgement that we are in a pickle, you and I,” Cozme said. “I’ve been charged with bringing the both of them back alive and you’re aiming to cut down on half that charge.”

“It is unfortunate that the demands of our honour are at odds,” Angharad replied, meaning it.

She liked the older man. He was skilled at arms and friendly, a pleasant conversationalist and reliable in a fight. She could not even hold his loyalty to Augusto Cerdan against him, as it was the mark of fine retainer to remain at their master’s side no matter the turn of the tide – or whether such loyalty was truly deserved.

“I don’t want to fight you, Lady Angharad,” he bluntly said. “But I’ll have to, if it’s the only way to keep the boy alive.”

The Pereduri acknowledged as much with a nod. They had both known this without need for a conversation, so soon Master Cozme should reveal why it was he had approached her.

“I wouldn’t ask you to set aside your honour,” Cozme Aflor slowly said, “but-”

Her brow rose, a clear warning for him to tread lightly.

“- it seems to me there is some room for maneuver in the terms of your challenge,” he continued. “We’re under truce until ‘peril passes’, are we not?”

“The sanctuary before the second trial is the natural end to that oath,” Angharad said. “We will be beyond peril’s reach there.”

“But only temporarily,” Cozme argued. “In a greater sense, the entire Dominion of Lost Things can be said to be a place of peril.”

Angharad frowned at him.

“You want me to duel him in Sacromonte instead,” she said. “After the trials have passed.”

Her tone made clear what she thought of the wisdom of the proposal.

“You’re aiming to be a blackcloak, aren’t you?” Cozme said. “You’ll be under the protection of the Watch when you come, it won’t be something that can be swept under the rug with knife or powder.”

As good as an admission that otherwise the House of Cerdan might have resorted to these, which in truth did not surprise her.

“There is no guarantee the Watch will let me duel him, even if the challenge was made before my joining,” Angharad pointed out.

The bearded man looked frustrated, and though the thought was unkind Angharad could not help but wonder: even should she accept this, would she ever find Augusto Cerdan no matter how many times she came knocking at the gates of his home? Or would he coincidentally be out travelling every time she arrived, set out on some business or other?

“A compromise then,” Master Cozme pressed. “I would have time of you, since there is an interpretation where giving it does not mar your honour.”

“I am not so generous a woman as to give mine without purpose,” Angharad replied.

“There would be,” Cozme assured her. “How much do you know of the Trial of Ruins?”

Only what she had been told, which was not much. The Cerdan brother knew that their foreknowledge was part of what kept people with them so they had remained tight-lipped. Isabel, disappointingly, had followed their lead in this.

“It is a maze of some kind, which we must march through to cross the mountains,” she said.

“It’s more than that,” Cozme said, shaking his head. “It is all made of broken shrines, a labyrinth-city dedicated to dead gods. And whatever it is broke them, Lady Angharad, it sowed a hatred deep in the stone. Now those who would pass the shrines must first survive cruel games led by their shadows, beating them to open paths.”

“It sounds a fearsome place,” she admitted.

“It is where most people die, during these trials,” Cozme meaningfully said. “Even infanzones succumb to traps and tests. And it is my charge to keep the brothers alive, one I will see through, but I am only a man. The Manes might decide I am to fail despite all efforts.”

He shrugged, looking at her expectantly. The offer lay unspoken but not less clear for that: Master Cozme wanted her to wait until the end of the second trial to see if circumstance would make an honour duel entirely unnecessary. If Augusto Cerdan was taken by the Trial of Ruins, Angharad could hardly demand a duel of a corpse. Master Cozme was making it plain he would still do his best to keep Augusto alive, as his honour demanded, but was asking to delay the duel so they might find out if the Sleeping God had other ideas. Should he not, then they could still duel before the Cerdan withdrew from the trials. It was a neat solution, she would admit, toeing the line of honour for all involved.

It was also near certain to get her killed.

Beyond the second trial lay another sanctuary, where it was the intention of the infanzones to desist from their candidature to the Watch and place themselves under its protection so they might be taken back to Sacromonte. Should Augusto Cerdan succeed at claiming that protection, he would be beyond her reach. That meant she must either plumb the depths of the labyrinth with the infanzones to ensure he could not, risking having a knife slid into her back during these ‘games’, or that she must find her own way through and wager she would cross before he did so she might intercept him on the other side. Even the better of these wagers was bad: the infanzones knew much of these trials and she little, something certain to be an edge when struggling against a maze.

Yet Angharad did not voice the refusal that her heart whispered.

“It is a compromise,” she said instead.

When she had been thirteen – only five years ago, though it felt like a lifetime away – she had journeyed with servants to Iswayo, one of the great cities of southern Malan, for a tournament. She had not been a favourite to win, still young to the circuit, but already her skill was known from some lesser victories. One the day of the tournament, she learned that it was to be the debut of the daughter of a great izinduna. And coincidence had decided that, by the branches of the fighting-tree, she was to face that very girl on her second fight. Should they both win their first, of course. Angharad had duly expected victory there. An hour before the tournament began, as she was limbering up, a nameless servant had approached her and smilingly begun to talk.

Without ever naming names of saying anything outright, he had implied that should the daughter of a great house find unexpected success there might be boons for those involved. Why, the Sleeping God might find it fit for Angharad to be invited to a much more prestigious tournament in the capital and even be blessed with an auspicious start to competition there. The man bore no weapon, made no threat and never ceased smiling. Angharad was excruciatingly polite in her refusal, offended but unwilling to make a powerful enemy, and the nameless man had neither blustered nor gotten angry. Instead he had thanked her for her time and taken his leave.

A few minutes before the tournament began, Angharad had found that the name of her opponent in her first branch had been changed for one of the favourites to win.  She lost to the other girl after a respectable bout, who then in turn went on to lose by an excitingly small margin to the izinduna’s daughter in the following match. It was an exciting bout, all agreed, and a fine debut even if the girl did not make it too far after that. There had been a lesson in that day, one she had well learned.

And as Angharad walked side by side with Cozme Aflor, this genial and pleasant man who had taken great pains to avoid enmity between them, she knew sure as the coming of the tide that if she refused him now he would try to kill her. Not right now, perhaps not even today or tomorrow, but a time would come and then without bluster or warning Master Cozme would shoot her in the back or stab her in the heart. That clear-headed patience was a hundred times more dangerous than anything Augusto and Remund Cerdan had it in them to muster, for it was nothing more than a loyal retainer doing what his duty demanded of him.

“I would require assurances,” Angharad finally said, “that the challenge will not be fled.”

“That could be arranged with the Watch when we get to the sanctuary,” Cozme said, sounding pleased. “You’d be willing to wait until the end of the second trial?”

“Should this be true, then I will delay my challenge until the end of the Trial of Ruins,” Angharad precisely said. “If you would have an oath of me, I-”

“You word is enough,” the older man firmly said, shaking his head. “You are Malani.”

He meant it as a compliment, she thought, so she would not take offence. Even the merchants of Malan were known as honest to all the peoples of Vesper, since outing them as liars could ruin their trade. Honour was important, on the Isles, and taint had a way of passing by association: it was not only nobles who were careful of the company they kept. Reputation must be carefully curated, but then work was not rewards. Malani, it was said, did not lie. Their word was taken as bond when given, and the same trust was given to the peoples of the High Isle and the Low.

I give you then my hand,

Promised in salt and air

And by your side will stand

The wife that you won fair

Master Cozme was in a fine mood when they parted ways that evening, certain he had gotten from her what he wanted. He had not. Angharad had agreed to delay a challenge, never promising not to issue another. It would be most satisfying to strike Augusto Cerdan a second time. Angharad let that prospect bring a smile to her face as they all ate, arrayed in the same unspoken camps they had this morning. Song and Brun on her side, the brothers and their protector on the other, Isabel and her maids in between. Only, she saw, now the lay of the land had changed. Remund smiled often at Augusto, almost smirking, and Cozme no longer kept a hand near his pistol. Isabel sometimes shot the younger Cerdan dark looks and seemed to be encouraging Briceida to speak with Brun.

Angharad Tredegar watched them all and saw in them her father’s lessons learned. Eating her dried fruits, she hummed under her breath of old tricks.

Here! Stars reflected in wine,

a seashell held to your ear,

the mountain I claim as mine,

and a hearth rats do not fear

The Tianxi at her side leaned close.

“You’ve been toying with that tune all day,” Song quietly said. “ I am now official intrigued: may I know what it is called?”

She flushed, embarrassed at having been caught out.

“The Fair Wife,” Angharad replied.

“A love ballad?” the Tianxia chuckled, eyes teasing. “I had not thought you in such a mood.”

The Pereduri shook her head.

“It is a can lan, a shore-song,” she explained. “They are ballads that teach lessons through a story.”

Most were old as Morn’s Arrival, the story went, and first sung to teach her ancestors when their ships found the stony shores of Peredur. The Fair Wife was said to be about a man seeking a beautiful spirit’s hand in marriage, of the tricks played to get one’s way. Song’s silver eyes stayed on her, full of a steady confidence that was a firmer cousin to calm.

“And what lesson does it teach?”

Father had said that the lesson was that you received what you gave, a tale of reciprocity. Mother had often said it was simply about how spirits, like many men, simply could not be trusted. She had never entirely believed either, finding her own answer as a can lan encouraged.

“That cleverness is a sword with two edges,” Angharad Tredegar replied. “And every so often, we get everything that we deserve.”

After all, the last couplet was sung by the spirit and not the man.

Sweet love, I find no fault

and leave now in your care

this hand of air and salt:

the wife that you won fair.

# Chapter 12

It was an unusual experience, Tristan mused, to be treating others using a poisoner’s kit in ways he had largely learned through study of interrogation. Not that anyone could tell the difference.

“I don’t need a stick to bite down on,” Felis insisted. “It’s just a little pain, I can take it.”

In most circumstances, the man might even have been right: regular use of dust could dull one’s sense of pain. Not so here, however. Aines fretted at her husband’s side but he kept pushing her away.

“I once saw a man bite through his own tongue,” Tristan conversationally said. “It didn’t kill him – it is not usually a lethal wound, you see – but it did seem to be an excruciatingly painful experience.”

The dust addict paled, fiddling with his choppy brown hair.

“Are you much of a singer, Felis?” the thief asked.

The man glared, but he took the stick and placed his teeth against it. Tristan immediately ripped out the bolt, ignoring the half-swallowed scream that followed. It was a nasty little piece of work, the thief thought as he eyed the arrowpoint the hollows had used. Serrated so that it would cut flesh again on the way out. Felis went through spasms of pain, shivering, as Tristan set down the bolt and got to work cleaning the wound. A rag drenched in alcohol, then makeshift bandages made of ripped clothing. The man should be in no danger of bleeding out, but Tristan could not say if the flesh would take sick. Clothes made for poor bandages and they had too few to spare for the thief to be able to change them often.

“It is much as I can do,” he told Felis. “I will give you something for the pain before you go to sleep.”

That made all of them. Vanesa and Aines had gotten away with little more than bruises, Francho’s rib was sprained but not broken and Yong had taken no wound at all. After Felis the worst off was Sarai: pins and needles had ripped at the side of her face when her veils and mask were torn off. Those he had not taken care of: after borrowing alcohol to clean the wounds, she had seen to them herself. Of Lan there was still no sign, not that they would take her in should she return. What worth was there in keeping around someone who would run when the knives came out? Choices must be paid for. Felis spat out the stick and rose to his feet, striding away without another a word. His wife stayed behind.

“Thank you, Tristan,” Aines tiredly told him. “He appreciates it as well, he just-”

Under the weariness and the wear, he could still see the shape of the woman she must have been when she was young. Dark hair and kind brown eyes, a heart-shaped face and slender frame. The kind of looks men of the Murk considered beautiful.

“This place, it doesn’t bring out the best in us,” she finished. “It will be better when we get out.”

No it won’t, Tristan thought. The thief hesitated. He had decided not to involve himself too closely with the pair, wary of getting caught in the inevitable explosion, but now their company’s numbers had thinned and wounds had been taken. If he could nudge their situation into coming to a head a little later, perhaps the second trial, it would be a boon.

“Lan ran off with the dust,” he said. “How long before it gets bad?”

Aines’ smile did not quite hide the shame in her eyes.

“Noticed that, did you?” she said. “I thought you might, you’ve got Murk all over you.”

And they both knew that dust and the other drugs peddled there killed people just as sure as the plague, only slower and uglier. The dark-haired woman worried her lip.

“Two days,” she finally said. “Maybe longer if your extract for the pain scratches the itch some.”

“That could be a problem,” Tristan admitted.

One he did not have much to mend, save if one counted poison a solution. The sound Aines answered by was too bleak to truly be called a laugh.

“Yeah,” she exhaled. “I know. Gods, I know.”

“It seems ill-advised,” he delicately said, “to be taking these trials given his… condition.”

His more than hers. Aines seemed as needful of gambling as her husband was of dust but her body would not rebel at the lack of it: it was an affliction of the mind more than the flesh. He already knew they had not come here by choice, that they had been paid for by others, but tired and grateful as she was a small invitation like this should be enough to get her talking.

“You think we had a choice?” Aines bitterly replied. “We both racked up debts with the Cordero Sonriente, only we didn’t know about each other’s. One of their collectors put it together and came knocking at our door.”

Tristan winced. The Cordero Soriente has begun as a charitable house the infanzones had meant to clothe and feed the poor souls of the Murk, but infamously within a year it’d begun selling goods on the side and running whores in its chapterhouses. The Guardia never raided them, after all, lest the noble patrons be offended. By the time the thief was born the Cordero had branched into loans as well and earned a hard reputation among that crowded trade. They were respectable enough they could afford to pay the redcloaks to come and collect for them and the Guardia did not play nice when it came to the Murk.

“Yeah, that bad,” Aines sighed. “The debt was big enough we would have been bound for the mines until we died, only we have five kids and no one who could take care of them. So when they offered to wipe the debt if we took the trials, it wasn’t much of a choice at all.”

“They would not have made the offer without getting something out of it,” Tristan said.

Aines convulsed, and with some surprise the thief realized that she was crying. It was not the tears that surprised him – he’d choked on bitter sobs in his time – but that she would allow herself to shed them before a man half a stranger. Tristan gently put a hand on her shoulder but did not take her into his arms as an impulse demanded. He knew better than to get attached.

“It’s a sport to them,” she croaked out. “They pay the blackcloaks for the reports, after. So they know what happened in the trials.”

“What did they tell you, Aines?” he pressed.

“They’ll drown my children,” she whispered, “if Felis kills me before the end of the trials.”

Sympathy welled up, but only a shallow stream. Most of his mind was on the talk he had overheard between the two, the way Felis had pushed for them to leave the group. To go off alone. And just as Aines must have come to, he grew sure the Cordero must have promised him something if he killed her before the end of the trials. Red games, Yong had called these. What a pretty turn of phrase for such an ugly thing. He kept Aines company until the tears ran out and she muttered some excuses, returning to her cot like someone who did not know where else to go. Felis began a whispered argument with her within moments and Tristan decided to wait before he went over with the painkiller.

Instead it was to Yong’s side he went, sitting by the man as he oiled and cleaned his sword. The Tianxi glanced his way with an inquisitive look.

“I don’t think they’re salvageable,” Tristan frankly said, careful not the glance the pair’s way as he did. “They were pointed at each other by their creditor.”

“They’re useful in a fight,” Yong just as frankly replied. “I’d be more inclined to get rid of the greyhairs than these two if we must cut weight loose.”

“I’m not saying we cut them,” he replied, “but they can’t be trusted for anything delicate. It’s only a matter of time until one knifes the other.”

Either Felis for what he had been promised or Aines to avoid the same.

“Come the second trial, they are no longer our trouble,” Yong pragmatically said. “Will they last until then?”

Tristan grimaced.

“Probably,” he conceded, then passed a hand through his hair. “Marriage, huh. What a fool’s game.”

Yong shot him a highly amused look.

“You are speaking,” the Tianxi said, “to a married man.”

“Ah,” the thief coughed. “I mean no offence. I am sure your wife-”

“Husband,” Yong drily corrected.

“- husband is a fine man,” Tristan hastily assured him.

“He is,” the other man replied, but a hint of something lay under the even tone. “But I’ll grant you it can sometimes make for a crowded bed, each other and our pasts all squeezed tight.”

Much as the thief was itching to poke at that, to see what might come out, a look at Yong’s face was enough for him to decide otherwise. It was a closed shutter, and the Tianxi was shifting restless in that way Tristan had come to recognize as meaning he wanted to drink. The earlier violence seemed to have invigorated Yong, enough that he’d not drunk liquor all afternoon, but now the clouds were returning. Best head that off as hard as he could: if the day’s fighting had proved anything, it was that without Yong they were all halfway to the grave.

“I am glad you are now calm,” Tristan said, “for you seemed angry when you first saw Sarai’s looks under the mask.”

“Hollows can’t be trusted,” the Tianxi bluntly said. “If she had been one, either she or I would have left this company.”

“I have not found them any worse than men,” the thief said. “Is this a matter of faith?”

No one, not even cultish Redeemers, denied the truth of the Circle Perpetual – the endless cycle of reincarnation that bound all souls not marred by the Gloam. To be a darkling, hollow, was to be evicted from the Circle and see your immortal soul tarnished into mortality. There were faiths of Vesper who thought this a great sin, something disgusting or wicked, and so thought hollows disgusting and wicked as well. The Orthodoxy should not be one of them, but then in practice Tristan knew precious little of the Cathayan Orthodoxy.

“It is a matter of fact,” Yong replied. “All men go mad when law runs thin, Tristan. When there are no more punishments, the savagery we pretend we’ve never learned comes creeping out.”

His dark eyes looked at something beyond the cast of the lantern’s light, the kind of haunting that could be a world away and still closer than your own skin.

“I have seen men I thought decent rape and steal and kill for no better reason than they could,” he said. “But in the end, for all our cruelties, we are still men.”

The former soldier’s jaw clenched.

“I have found half-eaten children by the road,” Yong said with desolate calm, “where hollows went raiding. I’ve tread over the broken bones of hundreds fed to mad gods, seen the aftermath of ritual so horrifying even the worst of Izcalli candlemen would balk at their use.”

His tone had not grown heated but it’d risen loud enough they were drawing looks.

“We still curse by the Old Night for a reason,” he said, lowering the pitch of his voice after he noticed the attention. “And that is the world hollows would bring back: darkness for all, forever. No trust can or should survive that truth.”

Tristan slowly nodded, keeping his thoughts off his face. He would not argue with Yong, not when the subject drew such fervour from the other man, but he was not convinced. There were entire kingdoms of hollows out there, great empires risen and fallen beyond the cast of the Glare. Scholars were certain that most of Vesper belonged to the hollows, and if Yong were right then the Old Night would long ago have been brought back. No, Tristan suspected that most hollows were no better or worse than men. Shaped differently by circumstance, perhaps, but not made of such different clay.

It was the cults that were things of horror, and a cult was not a kingdom – much less a hundred of them.

“I’ll not argue with killing those Red Eye bastards,” the thief said. “Though I hope you’ll forgive me if I’d rather sneak past them if we can.”

Yong waved his words away.

“So would I,” he said. “And I can only wince at how Sarai must have suffered for her people’s resemblance to hollows. I expect half the people she’s ever met have tried to clap her in chains.”

“Not Tianxi, no?” Tristan asked. “I thought the Republics didn’t hold with slavery.”

“All are free under Heaven,” Yong dutifully quoted. “It’s against all the laws on all the books, it’s true, but it doesn’t stop some of the traders from shipping slaves.”

Ah, Tristan thought. Transporting the ‘merchandise’ was not buying or selling it, he deduced, which allowed the unscrupulous to follow the letter of the law. He was no longer a boy of ten, blindly admiring that the Tianxi had sent all their nobles to the chopping block and dreaming their land a veritable paradise. The Heavenly Republics were just as flawed a beast as the other great powers of Vesper, he knew that. But he was still disappointed, somehow, that men who’d made themselves free would force the opposite on others.

“The slave trade has made Malan rich,” he sighed. “And the man who hates gold has yet to be born.”

The Second Empire had used slaves by the millions and most peoples of Vesper still did – the infanzones might not call them such, but the hollows mining rubies and gold for them were slaves in deed – yet it was only ever hollows that Liergan had kept in chains. That time, that practice, had come at an end. The Kingdom of Malan had grown terribly wealth by stealing men in the north and shipping them to their western colonies, where they toiled raising rich crops under the Glare for their masters. And the tribes below the Broken Gates were very much men, for though they were pale of skin they were not severed from the Circle Perpetual. The Glare did not burn them.

Yong snorted.

“When I was a boy,” he said, “my grandmother told me it was Lucifer himself that made gold, for he knew that even sealed in Pandemonium gold would be enough for men to destroy themselves.”

Tristan could not help but smile. It seemed that no matter where you were born, family tried to scare you with stories of the King of Hell.

“My father used to tell how he invented sleep,” the thief said, “by botching a spell to kill all the world.”

“That’s a clever one,” Yong appreciated, then wiped his sword down one last time. “And a timely reminder of what I ought to do. Francho still has first watch?”

Tristan nodded.

“Good, the greyhairs need to earn their keep,” the former soldier said. “Will you speak with Sarai before turning in for the night?”

The thief cocked an eyebrow.

“Should I?” he asked, surprised.

“Who, if not you?” Yong shrugged. “The two of you have been fingers from the same hand since we left the yiwu.”

He frowned, recognizing the Cathayan word but not the meaning.

“Relics?”

“Nobles,” Yong explained, smiling.

There was a calm certainty behind that smile, the look of a man who knew the way the world was headed and that its road would inevitably be paved with the graves of his enemies. And who was the Tristan to argue that? The Tianxi still chopped kings into four pieces, whenever they got their hands on them, and no crown in Vesper had been able to make them stop. Parting ways with the still-smiling man, Tristan flicked a glance Sarai’s way. She was sitting alone, Aines and Felis giving her wide berth, and while Vanesa had not been driven off by the pale skin the bespectacled old woman was sound asleep.

He’d barely exchanged twenty words with her since her face was revealed, Tristan realized. They’d had to run half a day and he’d spent all his time since camp was made seeing to wounds. Perhaps a conversation truly was due, even if exhaustion was catching up to him. Sitting across from Sarai’s pack, the thief popped his neck and let out a little sigh of satisfaction at the ensuing crack. He got an unimpressed look from the dark-haired woman for it.

“You could have done that before coming over,” she said.

“And let you miss out?” Tristan charmingly smiled. “You wound me.”

“Do it again and I just might,” Sarai threatened, but her lips twitched. “I can’t stand the sound.”

“I will take that in due consideration,” the thief assured her.

There was a pause, and as he met her eyes he reached for his thumb with deliberate obviousness and the most obnoxious grin in his repertoire.

“Don’t you dare,” she warned.

“How’s the face?” Tristan idly asked.

“Fine,” she warily said, eye still on his thumb, “the cuts aren’t deep and-”

The thief pulled at his thumb before she could finish the sentence, the small crack of the joint popping getting an indignant cry out of her. He was forced to shield his face with his arms when she began enthusiastically beating him with her veil. By the time she’d finished retaliating, the two of them were grinning. Sarai shook her head, reluctantly pleased.

“The cuts won’t even scar,” she told him. “I’ve had worse shaving my legs. How are your burns?”

“Better than they’ve any right to be,” he honestly replied. “They’re clean and the flesh is red instead of black, which is a good sign.”

That he felt pain around it was a good sign, for great burns bit deep enough you could no longer feel pain there at all.

“The bruise on my side is more of a pain,” Tristan said. “It’s a good thing I already slept on my back.”

“I’ll be doing the same for a few weeks, I’d think,” Sarai grunted. “Shallow they may be, but I can’t rest on them without hissing.”

He nodded in sympathy, the two of them sitting in comfortable silence for a while. It was him that broke it, almost to his regret.

“Are we going to talk about it?” he idly asked.

The secret that’d come out, all the petty little things tied to it.

“No,” Sarai replied.

He cocked his head to the side.

“If we survive the trials?”

“Then I’ll give you my name,” Sarai agreed. “My real one. If you want more, you’ll have to trade in kind.”

A fair bargain, as tended to be her way.

“Past is past,” Tristan shrugged. “I am more interested in what is to come.”

A request for information less dear but more immediately pressing. How far did Sarai intend to go, on this Dominion of Lost Things? Blue eyes considered him.

“By the end of these trials,” Sarai said, “I will be wearing a black cloak.”

“That is my aim as well,” Tristan replied, pleased and not hiding it.

It meant their alliance could continue until the end. With Yong intending to join the Watch as well, he would have two reliable companions to go into the coming trials with. Sarai passed a hand through her dark tresses, face closing, then let out a sigh.

“This year’s trials,” she said, lowering her voice, “are not like the others.”

He stared at her unblinking.

“Some of us were marked for more than simply joining the Watch,” Sarai said.

He could not muster much surprise. He had known something was off since first setting foot on the Bluebell. Some things were not adding up: Abuela had given him a shot at Cozme Aflor and a pair of Cerdan by sending him here, but there had been other ways. His mentor did not simply want him in the Watch, she had wanted him on that particular ship. Why?

“You are one of those chosen few, I take it?” Tristan asked.

“I am,” she said, smiling faintly. “But so are you.”

Despite their best effort, that knowledge did more to keep him awake than the bruises.

—

The tall grass felt sinister, now that they knew what might be waiting for them hiding behind the stalks.

Their company had taken wounds, enough to smell of blood, and that meant they had to worry about more than the cultists of the Red Eye now that they’d broken camp and resume their march. Lupines would prefer the open plains to the tall grass they were cutting through, but there were many kinds of lemures out there. The first creatures they found, though, were not lemures at all. Early in the morning Aines let out a small scream that had them all going for weapons, but what she had almost stumbled over did not end up warranting such dread: on the ground were a pair of wobbly carapace globes, from which tails with maces at the end protruded. The tails were being waved menacingly, though Tristan would have felt rather more menaced if the creature it belonged to was not cowering blindly inside its carapace.

“Those are glyptonts,” Vanesa pointed out amusedly. “No threat to you, my dear, unless your feet are made of weeds.”

“They’re harmless, then?” Aines carefully asked.

“Usually herbivores,” Francho confirmed.

He was met with an uncomprehending and somewhat worried look.

“A creature that eats only plants,” the old professor clarified.

The silent reproach on Aines’ face at not having simply said that from the start had the thief smothering a smile.

“I recall reading that they favour mud,” Tristan said. “We might be near a pond we’ll need to go around.”

Francho shook his head.

“They prefer flowing water,” the toothless old man corrected. “For cleaning their scales. A river, more like. And if one of you gentlemen would do me the favour of tipping one over?”

“That seems unnecessarily cruel,” Yong objected half-heartedly.

Sarai, not so burdened, borrowed the Tianxi’s musket and carefully rolled one of the glyptonts upside down while avoiding the mace-tail. The other let out a strangely mouse-like squeak, tail disappearing inside like it’d been sucked in, and promptly began a strategic retreat. It had abandoned its fellow quite ruthlessly, the thief noted.

“No honour among glyptonts either, huh,” he muttered.

Meanwhile, Francho was coughing into his hand as he leaned over the belly-up glyptont that Sarai was holding down with the butt of the musket while it tried to flee. Aside from the four stumpy legs Tristan had expected there, though, was what looked like a round mouth in the middle of the belly surrounded by wiggling brown tentacles and a set of horn-like mandibles. Ergh. Francho, however, looked quite pleased.

“This is a reed glyptont,” he informed happily, “a particular species that subsists not only of weeds but also small fish and frogs.”

Aines shot him a betrayed look. Her foot at been at risk after all.

“And why should we care?” Felis said, putting a comforting hand on his shoulder.

“Because it means the river ahead shouldn’t have predators large enough to bother our little friend,” Sarai replied, allowing the glyptont to flip back on the ground.

It scuttled away into the grass, tail waving at them in what might have been meant to be warning but ended up looking like a child enthusiastically waving goodbye. Felis still looked mulish – he’d been in a foul mood all day and there was no mystery as to why – so Yong elaborated further.

“There should not be anything large enough to attack us as we cross it,” the Tianxi said.

All agreed it was best to go through instead of around, time being the greatest of luxuries, and with a little luck running water behind them might even put off lemures on their tail. It was not long before they could hear the flowing water and within a quarter hour they’d reached muddy banks. The water did not go deeper than the waist of the shortest among them – a toss-up between Aines and Vanesa, now that Lan was gone – and the current was strong but not impossible to manage. A glyptont was hiding in reeds further downriver, thoughtfully chewing at stalk that poked right out and wobbled with every chew, while frogs croaked a quiet welcome.

They took a short pause to fill their waterskins and wash their faces before beginning the crossing. Tristan volunteered to go first, as someone must, and found the footing treacherous but hardly dangerous if you took your time. He called back to be careful with the stones at the bottom, which were slippery, and waited for Sarai to throw him the end of the rope. He found a fallen, rotting tree to tie it to while she secured it to a stone on the other end, their company then going about getting their affairs across. His medicine cabinet, in particular, required much careful handling not to take water. It had already proved its worth, so there was only minimum grumbling about the work.

Yong was to be the last across and Vanesa was halfway through, the lot of them nearly in the clear, so naturally Tristan was already tense as a string when it all went wrong.

They should have seen it coming, tall as it was, or even heard it. But it was a hunter, and so there was no trace at all until it was out of the tall grass. The beak first, a cruelly curved thing black as tar that rose as the creature stretched into its full height: at least ten feet, a cascade of deep purple feathers flecked with wriggling pale blue eyes. Its legs were bone, ending in great curved claws, and from under folded wings skeletal arms peeked out. The eyeless head should have felt like a bird’s, all creased leather, but instead Tristan was somehow certain a man was looking at him. He did not need to be told what he was looking at: night-terror, eye-taker. A gravebird.

“Do not-” Tristan began, tone forcefully even.

Then Aines screamed and it all went to Hell.

The gravebird wailed and the thief flinched, the sound echoing between his ears until he had to scream to let it out. His tongue tasted of blood. Eyes wild, he fumbled for his knife even as Sarai swallowed a sob behind him. It was on Yong in an instant, cruel beak tearing into the Tianxi’s shoulder as he tried to draw his sword. He fell with a scream and Tristan rushed to the water as the gravebird gobbled down the flesh it’d ripped, the blues eyes on its feathers slowly beginning to spin. They were beautiful, he thought, but then Fortuna let out a shout of alarm and he tore his gaze away.

“Don’t look at the eyes,” he yelled.

“Jebati,” Sarai cursed, then he heard someone getting slapped across the face.

Felis let out a bellow of anger, but Tristan had no time for this: he reached for Vanesa. The old woman was panicking, had fallen halfway to her knee slipping on stone, and the hand not clutching the rope felt slick as a fish when she caught his own. They struggled to drag her out of the river. Yong… he was on the wrong side, and sometimes luck was not kind.

Most of the time, really.

Only when Tristan glanced up, the creature was not finishing off the former soldier. It was looking at them instead, slinking forward and through the water like it didn’t feel the current at all. The gravebird moved unhurriedly, so sure they were all meat on the plate it was taking the time to toy with them. It let out another wail and Tristan shouted back to ward it off, Fortuna shouting with him, their voices threading as one. But Vanesa, Vanesa clapped her hands over her ears. The moment she no longer held the rope the current took her, would have swallowed her downstream if not for the orb of Gloam that formed in her way. The old woman hit it like she’d been thrown, crying out in pain, but clutched it so she would not be swept away.

“Quick,” Sarai yelled, “I can’t-”

Skeletal fingers gently cradled Vanesa’s cheek, the gravebird pulling her close, and Tristan watched with horror as the other hand bone hand went for her right eye. He threw his knife, but the gravebird dismissively flicked its feathers and it barely sliced into one of them. The blade went with the current and now he was out. The other knife was with his pack, all he had was a broken relic pistol and gods – Vanesa screamed, the gravebird ripping out the eye and placing it in a featherless hollow under its throat. One more feather in the making, Vanesa’s eyes gone blue painted over it. They were all going to die, Tristan realized. He needed to run, to…

The shot took the gravebird in the side of the head. It let out a cry of fury, but though Yong flinched at the sound like the rest of them the former soldier tossed down his musket and pulled his pistol. Another shot in the side of the head, magnificently placed – feathers went flying and Tristan glimpsed black flesh like a sea of worms. There was a hole there, staying made though the ball was already falling out. It would change nothing: a gravebird had as many lives as it had eyes. They had been worshipped as gods, once. Yong was out of triggers to pull, so the wounded man drew his blade and Tristan watched numbly as the gravebird’s skeletal hand reached for Vanesa’s second eye.

“It seeds fear in you,” Fortuna whispered into his ear. “That is what the wails are really for. You are not helpless.”

He let out a laugh that was half a sob, desperately fighting the current to stay standing. What was he to do, hit the monster with his broken pistol? Absurd as the thought was it was still better than nothing, so he reached for the pistol and as the wet wood slid against his palm his gaze found the engravings on the side.

“Please,” Vanesa begged. “Please.”

And Tristan, fool that he was, palmed his priceless treasure. A piece of rhadamantine quartz, burning with the Glare’s light, and then as he met Fortuna’s smiling golden eyes he borrowed luck. The ticking began but he paid it no mind. All he needed was a moment. The thief threw the stone, and just as he did the gravebird turned: with perfect, impossible timing the rhadamantine quartz tumbled right into the hole in the side of creature’s head. And it got stuck.

The gravebird’s scream of complete and utter fury was so loud he couldn’t hear the ticking when he released the luck.

He snatched Vanesa by the back of her chemise, half-tearing it, and got her out of the way just as the gravebird began blindly flailing. It was in pain, shaking and screaming, but the quartz was well and stuck. May you burn from the inside, he thought with vicious satisfaction. No lemure enjoyed the touch of the Glare. Vanesa had grown deadened from pain and shock, her eyes empty, but she moved when he pushed and the two of them fell to their knees in the mud of the riverbank. On the other side of the river the gravebird was slashing at the ground in fury, Yong having wisely fled into the water while it was distracted.

“Go help him across,” Tristan ordered a gaping Felis, pulling Vanesa to her feet.

Francho was unconscious, he saw, so he told Aines to get him awake and passed the bespectacled – only half, now, the gravebird had ripped through the glasses to get to her eye – old woman to a sickly Sarai. They needed to take their bags and run before the gravebird rid itself of the quartz or drew something even worse. Going for his own affairs, only then did Tristan realized the prize he’d paid for his throw: down the banks his medicine cabinet lay against a jutting rock, broken and half-submerged. It’d tumbled down the slope while no one paid attention, half its contents spilling into the water or being ruined by it.

He’d have to salvage what he could.

Carelessly throwing all the stuff inside, mourning as he already saw there would be no more painkillers, he flicked a glance upriver and found Yong was being helped out of the water by Felis. On the other side, the gravebird had gone into the tall grass but its screams betrayed it had not yet gone far. Shoving the broken cabinet onto his back, the thief joined the others. Francho was back on his feet, looking half asleep and half dead. The wail had hit him much harder than everyone else, his eyes were still white with dread.

“We have to get moving right now,” Tristan said. “Anyone who can’t keep up is left behind.”

No one argued, for all knew that if the gravebird’s scream had not drawn the cult of the Red Eye yet then Yong’s two shots most certainly had.

—

The tall grass was the only reason they lived.

At least three warbands were scouring the land looking for them and in the open they would have been dead within the hour. Instead, by hook and crook, they hid and muddled on. Twice they had to lay down in mud at the bottom of crevasses as hollows passed above them, shadows lingering as they spoke amongst each other in a tongue older and harsher than Antigua. Their path was circuitous, Yong keeping them on grounds that would leave no easy tracks to find as they stumbled on wounded and tired. Tristan had taken just long enough to see to it that his and Vanesa’s wounds would not kill them before pressing on, but while he still had alcohol he no longer had numbing agents.

They would all be feeling their wounds.

Squirming through filth and bushes, they made their way forward. After some hours exhaustion became too much, forcing breaks, but no one slept well of for long. They could not afford to stay in place for too long with the cultists combing through the grass. Their company kept moving through the night, stealing away the odd hour of sleep when it could.

The start of the third day since they had split from the rest was not auspicious, everyone’s exhaustion sharpening tempers and slowing down the greyhairs even further. Felis was prickly as porcupine, constantly scratching at his arms and picking fights with the others. Yong had to threaten to cut out his tongue to get him to lay off Vanesa, who he accused of breathing so loudly she would draw the Red Eye onto them all. The sole relief was that, for all that their pace had slowed to a crawl, Sarai believed they were approaching the eastern bridge across the river.

Halfway through morning they found a toppled column rising out of the tall grass, enough so that when Tristan climbed atop it he was able to have a look further ahead.

“Good and bad,” the thief told them when he came down. “I believe I saw the silhouette of the statue that Sarai chose as our marker. We are at most half a day away from the bridge.”

“And the bad?” Vanesa resignedly asked.

“The tall grass ends soon,” Tristan said. “There is a span of open grounds between it and the beginning of the forest.”

And open grounds could well be the death of them all, if there were any cultists keeping an eye out for them. Their company broke out into murmurs, save for Francho who had laid a hand on the broken column and had gone into his own mind with unseeing eyes. After the others agreed that they should first head to the edge of the tall grass before deciding whether or not to risk it, Tristan shook the old man out of his reverie. Not with his hand, you never knew with contracts, but with the but of his useless pistol.

“Ah,” the toothless professor muttered. “Yes. We are going, I see.”

“You weren’t dozing off,” Tristan said. “You were listening to the stone.”

The old man nodded, quietly coughing into his hand.

“It is not from here,” Francho said.

The thief cocked a questioning eyebrow.

“It was stolen from a temple, brought here by cultists to serve as a watchtower of sorts,” the professor elaborated. “The men who carried them had strong opinions about being ordered to do this, and one broke his leg when it was dropped on it. That was… vivid.”

“You hear their voices,” Tristan slowly said, “as if hearing their old conversations?”

It was in poor form to inquire as to another’s contract, but if the old man wanted to unburden himself who was he to argue? Francho grimaced, shaking his head.

“Not so. It is more along the lines of what their hearts felt, when they touched the stone?” he tried. “I hear resonance of moments that were, nothing exact.”

It was still the kind of contract some would gladly murder over, Tristan thought, if it truly could steal secrets out of stone this way. How many bloody old lies could Francho drag out of graves, should he care to go looking into the past of Sacromonte? Or any city in the world, for that matter.

“Useful regardless,” Tristan simply said, then gestured for him to move. “Come on.”

Their company resumed the march, creeping towards the end of the tall grass with an obsessive care for quiet. Tristan kept an eye on Francho as they moved, looking for the trace of a price for the contract, but found none. Disappointing, but not surprising: gods did not always like their dues easily found. It was because he was watching that he saw the old man suddenly stiffen, looking around for something none of them saw. Mere feet away from the end of the tall grass a stone block was buried, nestled between weeds with only a corner peeking out. The old man discreetly ran his fingers against it while the others halted at the edge of the grass, eyes growing shadowed.

You heard that stone’s voice without pulling on your contract, Tristan thought. Was that his price, then? Francho could hear the secrets of stone, but he could never cease hearing them? A blessing and a curse all at once. Fortuna hummed, having taken an interest when she noticed his. The goddess began idly turning around the toothless old man, looking at him like a haggler inspecting a horse.

“He doesn’t seem like he’s becoming harmonious,” Fortuna wondered, “but he’d have to if he was always listening at everything. His god would be in his head all the time.”

Harmonious, Tristan thought with a grimace. That was how the goddess called turning into a Saint, which she insisted was a beautiful thing.

“There’s probably some tricky clause,” the Lady of Long Odds decided. “Like he can only hear on odd hours or when some other condition is met. Hearing the stuff won’t be his price, either, it’s just how his boon manifests.”

The thief made sure no one was looking at him before subtly nodding in acknowledgement.

“Someone decided to get fancy with him,” Fortuna sneered, tossing back her golden hair as she stalked away. “It’s all very crass, some parvenu god chortling at their own cleverness.”

Tristan could only fervently hope that the other god was not listening and taking offence, though he was distracted from that fresh worry by Yong’s sudden intake of breath. Brushing past Felis, the thief knelt at the Tianxi’s side and peeked out of the grass. There was no need to ask what had made the other man react: the cultists were in plain sight. Running across the flat grounds, a dozen armed hollows were rushing forward as they shouted. No, not forward. Away. They were fleeing the woods, Tristan realized.

“That,” Sarai whispered from behind him, “is not a good sign.”

The second sign they received that trouble had come was the mist. Clouds of it billowed out from the forest floor, almost like a wave of pale chasing the hollows. And from the dark of the trees, crushing trunks and stones in eerie silence, a massive silhouette came striding out. Legs thick as pillars swallowed the distance, chalk white and taller than men. In the cold light of the stars, Tristan glimpsed an enormity of pale flesh with large wriggling heads full of perfectly oval eyes, each mass ending in a great tentacle. The clouds billowed past the fleeing hollows, their screams suddenly going silent for all that their mouths were still open, and the great monster began snatching them up. Under the heads opened a gaping maw full of jutting bone tusks, and there the hollows were carelessly impaled and left to bleed out within the creature.

“A heliodoran beast,” Yong whispered. “Fuck. The captain said it would be asleep.”

“She said it might be asleep,” Tristan darkly replied. “It appears we’re not that lucky.”

They watched, shivering in fear, as the behemoth ate alive half the hollows and crushed a few more to death before wandering away in seeming boredom. The three cultists that survived ran into the tall grass well to the east of their company, heading away as fast as they could. It was only minutes after the great lemure was gone that the last of the mist dispersed and the oppressive silence with it. Tristan ran a tired hand through his hair, worrying his lip.

“We can’t head for the bridge while that thing is prowling around here,” Felis said.

For once, no one argued with the man.

“We need to wait it out,” Yong said. “Hide until it gets bored, then cross before the hollows return.”

“And if they come back before we do?” Aines asked. “We’d be walking right into an ambush.”

Neither was wrong.

“We cannot stay here,” Tristan said. “There’s still warbands looking for us, we need a hiding place.”

And to rest. They were all exhausted and getting worse. If there was a fight, half of them would fold in the first thirty seconds of it.

“The grass is full of cultists,” Sarai bluntly said, “and creatures altogether worse. There is nowhere for us to hide.”

“That,” Francho said, “is not entirely true.”

All eyes went to him. The old man let out a wet cough, then wiped his lips with the back of his hand.

“Several of the stones we’ve come across spoke of water,” he said. “They were taken from an old temple that has been swallowed by a swamp. I believe it was built on a tributary of the river we encountered yesterday, somewhere to our southeast.”

“Are you trying to kill us, you old bastard?” Felis growled. “It’ll be full of hollows just like the first one.”

“No,” Tristan frowned. “Not if they’ve been stripping it for parts. It’s not a sacred place to them.”

“You don’t know that,” Felis bit out. “You’re just guessing.”

“I am,” the thief admitted. “But it seems likely to me. Do you have a better idea?”

He did not, which settled the matter. Tristan ignored the whispered argument at the back of their company, Felis once more trying to convince his wife to leave and strike out on their own. Aines was much curter in her response than she had been last time.

—

It took them an hour and a half to find Francho’s temple, the last half hour spent mostly on finding a way through swampy grounds that did not involve wading waist-high in mud.

There was not a trace of hollows around when lantern light found the first curved gate jutting out of mud and filth, and Tristan could hazard a guess as to why. He’d seen great snakes slithering through the mud and larger shapes still in the water: crocodiles, or some creature that had the look of them. This was not a place friendly to either men or hollows. The old professor, however, guided them from stone to stone without once erring. They took an ancient pilgrim’s path of raised stone across the water, then passed through a dozen more curved gates to reach the temple itself: a squat square of a building topped by a dome that looked like a tulip’s bud. It was, improbably enough, still standing.

The swamp was nestled between overgrown hills, every inch of it infested with flies and croaking creatures. They were all eager to get out of the humid air and into the temple, which looked as if a storm had swept through. It had obviously been emptied of anything not nailed down by hollows, columns ripped out and mosaics stripped of colours. What few streaks of ancient white paint had not been melted away by the elements were covered with filth and grime, the place dripping of it and stinking worse than Pandemonium.

“This is disgusting,” Aines said, sounding like she was about to retch.

“There is a better place,” Francho told them, hopping up to a stone altar split in half with a younger man’s enthusiasm.

Behind it, the professor revealed narrow spiral stairs going down.

“There is a ritual pool down there,” he said, “that is older than the rest of this temple. At its back should be a hidden passage leading to a shrine this was all built over.”

Tristan could only ponder how formidably useful the old man’s contract was proving to be while glancing down at the slick, narrow stairs.

“These are too small for all of us to squeeze through,” he said. “We should send only a pair first.”

“As my old captain used to say: my thanks for volunteering,” Yong drawled.

The thief rolled his eyes. He had planned to go anyhow. He caught Sarai’s eye, silently asking, and she nodded in agreement. The stairs felt like they were sweating, moss growing in every corner, and Tristan almost slipped thrice. There was no grip as the walls were just as slippery as the floor. The chamber at the bottom looked more like a bath than the ritual pool Francho had described, a square hole full of scum water prefaced by cracked tiles while insects scuttled in corners, fleeing the lantern’s light. There were a few columns on a ledge at the back, most of them broken. Sarai caught up to him, steps careful as she avoided slipping. She took a skeptical look around.

“At least the smell is better than above,” she finally said.

“It’s a start,” Tristan conceded.

The reflection of the stone in the water made it look like there was a full wall, but as Francho had promised they found a passage tucked away behind a broken column. It was broad but low, enough that Tristan had to crawl on his hand and knees after handing off the lantern. Sarai followed closely behind. The thief reached the end of the tunnel, dropping quietly onto the floor of what looked like a natural cavern. The ceiling was full of dripping stalactites, a slightly sloped floor leading up to what appeared to a shrine carved into the stone. The cavern wall had been sculpted so it would look like the wall of the shrine, intricate silhouettes grasping each other’s hands and feet in an endless chain.

It cleverly made the shrine entrance look more than the vaguely oval hole in the stone that it was.

He helped Sarai down, the two of them moving up the slope in careful silence. The ground was wet, the stalactites dripping down likes knives dipped in blood, and there were insects scuttling just out of sight. Hand on his last knife, Tristan suddenly gestured for Sarai to stop. He sniffed at the air, smelling smoke, and saw the same conclusion bloom in her eyes as his jaw tightened: they were not alone in here.

“Close the lantern,” he murmured. “We can’t afford to be seen.”

Sarai grimaced, no more eager to be in the dark than he, but still worked the shutter until it closed. The two of them resumed their way upwards, moving with care not to make a sound. As soon as they got a better angle on the shrine door, they saw that there was trembling light inside. Pale, he thought. A lantern fed with Glare oil or powder, which meant this could not be hollows. He knew better than to think it meant they were safe. Pressing onward, they pressed themselves against the sides of the threshold to peek inside.

There Tristan found a camp had been made inside the cramped shrine, bedrolls laid down and packs piled up. There was even a small fire over which a pot was being made to boil, smelling of herbs. Two were tending to the food, and in the fire’s light Tristan recognized them immediately: Ferranda Villazur and her hired hand, the Malani huntsman Sanale.

Utterly surprised, he did not realize there was a third until she moved. The infanzona had not been foolish enough to leave her back unguarded. There was an alcove tucked away to the side of the entrance, just inside, and there someone who had been sitting was hastily getting up. They let out a noise of alarm and the other two immediately turned. Sarai let out a curse and Tristan brushed past her, knife up, pushing the guard against the wall. Holding his blade to their throat even as Sarai yelled for the other two to stay back, Tristan Abrascal froze when a curl of firelight revealed the face of who he’d just taken hostage.

“Well,” Lan mused, blue lips quirking as she swallowed the last of the bread she’d been chewing, “this is awkward.” 



# Chapter 13

Lady Ferranda Villazur, wide awake and miffed at rats invading her camp, pointed her pistol at him.

Though she must be a decent shot, Tristan was more worried by Sanale carefully aiming his long-barrelled musket. Malani had a reputation for being good shots and the same was true of huntsmen: a man who was both was not to be trifled with. Pressing his knife tighter against Lan’s throat, he forced her to stand between him and the threats.

“Muzzles down,” Tristan ordered, “or I slit her throat.”

Ferranda, seemingly more at ease in hunting leathers than she had ever been on the Bluebell, laughed in his face.

“Go ahead,” the infanzon said. “She’s not one of ours.”

“That’s unfortunate,” Tristan admitted.

“Right?” Lan complained. “And here I’d thought we were getting along.”

The surviving twin had yet to even struggle against his grasp, not seeming terribly concerned with being his hostage.

“This doesn’t need to turn violent,” Sarai called out. “We didn’t come here to fight.”

He noted with approval that she still moved to get part of Lan in between her and the potential shots.

“Walk away,” Sanale replied, “and there will be no fight.”

The tall Malani had not moved an inch since shouldering his musket, barely even blinking, but Tristan could not afford to keep his eyes on him: Ferranda was beginning to slowly inch left, towards a better angle of fire.

“We can’t do that,” Tristan said.

He took a half step back, moving to keep Lan in the way of both Ferranda and Sanale, and the infanzona stopped trying to flank him. For now.

“As a neutral and unconcerned party,” Lan opined, “I believe we should come to a peaceful resolution.”

She was unanimously ignored.

“We found this place first,” Ferranda told him. “By right it is ours to use.”

“The temple upstairs isn’t fit for sleeping,” Tristan replied. “The stink is unbearable and there’s no door to keep creatures out – if the choice is between you and crocodiles in my bedroll, I’ll take my chances here.”

He meant it too. It might be best to feign backing down first so they could come back in a while with more muscle, but the thief would not risk sleeping upstairs. Ferranda hesitated, which was unflattering to her stout face: she looked like she was biting down on a twig. She then shared a long look with her hired hand, who eventually nodded.

“We still have first claim,” Ferranda said. “If you want to use this place, your group will have to pay in supplies.”

Group, she had said, which meant she knew it was not only he and Sarai. Tristan spared a moment to glare at a cheerfully unrepentant Lan. She had wasted no time in selling information on them all.

“I even gave them my best guess about your contract for free,” she smilingly whispered. “Because fuck you, Tristan. Did you think I’d let you threaten me without paying for it?”

“That’s fair,” the thief conceded.

He was not offended by the sale on moral grounds, only irritated by the inconvenience of it.

“Do we have a bargain, Tristan?” Ferranda Villazur pressed.

He was still hesitating when Sarai brushed past him, coming fully into the fire’s light and exaggeratedly putting away her knife.

“In principle we agree,” she said. “Now let us talk specifics.”

Ferranda’s face tightened at the sight of the pale skin and Sanale moved his muzzle to aim at her without even realizing it, but when Tristan released a still-smiling Lan the tension released.

“You heard her,” Tristan said. “Let’s haggle.”

—

A day’s worth of rations each, cut in half for all those who would keep watch – which was, in practice, all of them. That was how much they’d pay. Sarai also got the pair to agree that their company could earn back more of the fee through chores: tending the fire, cooking, mending and washing clothes. There was some discontent among their group at the prospect of playing servants to the pair when they outnumbered them so, but sheer exhaustion saw to it no one refused the terms. Some among them might have accepting cutting off a finger for a good night’s sleep in a safe place.

The shrine itself was much too small to accommodate everyone – counting Ferranda and the huntsman, they now numbered ten – so most of them ended up spreading their bedroll right outside it. A round of introductions began then was aborted halfway through when it came out Lan was also here, few taking the revelation of her presence well. By the time tempers had cooled no one was in a mood for talk, so instead they went to sleep.

It was much refreshed that Tristan woke up that afternoon, most the other still sleeping. Yong was seated by the fire with Sanale, the two men talking in low voices as they gestured, and not far from them Vanesa was slowly and carefully plucking feathers off a freshly killed bird. Two more were waiting. The thief watched the careful way she moved, realizing she was trying to learn how to compensate for her missing eye. With everyone else asleep – save for Lan and Ferranda, who were missing – he decided he might as well help her. The discussion between the other seemed too involved to welcome a third.

Wordlessly he picked up another of the bird, some grey-feathered thing about the size of a duck, and got to plucking. Even missing an eye Vanesa was going faster than him, which had her smiling.

“Practice,” she excused him.

She adjusted her glasses on her face, after. Se was forever fiddling with them since the gravebird had ripped through glass and wire to get at her eye. The frame was bent and dug into the side of her head, but it was either that or not seeing much of anything.

“I don’t eat a lot of bird,” Tristan conceded.

Pork was cheaper. You could feed a pig damn near anything and they were much harder to steal than chickens – there was a reason they were the staple meat of the Murk.

“They are one of the only things I can cook,” Vanesa smiled. “My mother despaired I avoided the kitchen, but at least I learned her almond sauce recipe before she passed.”

“You worked, then,” the thief said.

“I am a clockmaker,” the old woman said, then grimaced and reached for the cloth covering her missing eye. “Or I was, at least. I am not sure I could do detail work anymore.”

Ah, Tristan thought. And there was the mystery of how she had afforded her pocketwatch and her glasses solved. Not only was clockmaking a lucrative trade, she worked with watches and lenses. A cobbler never went barefoot. It did not explain what a woman of her age and means was doing on the Dominion, but that mystery was being chipped away at slowly but surely. The thief decided to let the matter lie for now, as obtaining the story there was more a matter of curiosity than need, but Vanesa surprised.

“You must be wondering how I ended up here,” the old woman knowingly said.

“The question has crossed my mind,” Tristan admitted.

“You’re such a polite boy,” Vanesa chuckled, shaking her head. “It is no great secret, I don’t mind telling you.”

She plucked out another feather, dropping it to flutter.

“My son is in debt to the Menor Mano,” Vanesa said. “Enough he was never going to dig himself out, so they decided to send him here as payment. Only his leg was crippled, Tristan, so he was sure to die.”

The thief grimaced. This was an ugly story and he could already tell how it would end.

“I offered to go in his place,” the old woman said. “My husband is gone and tinkering no longer brings me the joy it used to. Better to spare my only son than spend my last years withering on the vine.”

He offered her a sad smile, at a loss of what to say. Was such a sacrifice to be praised? Tristan was not so sure. It was an act of love, but the man saved did not sound deserving of it. How long would it take before he frittered away his mother’s sacrifice?

“You are kind, listening to me ramble like this,” Vanesa said, patting his arm. “Doing so much to keep us alive when some of us are so little help.”

She sighed tiredly, leaning back.

“Do not let the trials burn it out of you,” she sleepily said.

And Tristan felt a sliver of shame, because he was not kind at all. Even as she had talked, part of him had been more concerned with the puzzle than the woman. The same part that’d noted the Menor Mano had sent in two souls this year – Ocotlan, that large Aztlan, had been a legbreaker for them – and wondered if there was anything there he could use.

They plucked the rest of the birds in silence, and when he left afterwards it felt a little like fleeing.

—

By afternoon’s end everyone was awake and the cave had turned bustling.

Lanterns were fully unveiled as everyone busied themselves: clothes were washed and mended, wounds seen to and there was haggling over the fresh meat and use of the fire for cooking. Their refuge had turned into a smallest of villages, a happy one now that everyone was rested and fed, but Tristan knew it would not last. Already Felis was growing prickly, though never when Yong and Sanale were looking, and Lan had somehow charmed Vanesa into speaking with her again. Tristan washed and mended his clothes, leaving them to dry as he sat in little more than a shirt and underclothes.

The currents were plain to see. Aines was furious at her husband for the glances he kept throwing at Lan, who would no doubt fork over some dust by day’s end to get a leash on the man again. Vanesa was too bloodied and exhausted to do much of anything, and whenever Francho wasn’t coughing in a corner he was peering at the carvings to the left shrine entrance – which was irritating Felis, whose bedroll was near there. Ferranda had begun speaking with a surprised Sarai, who warmed to her before long. Much as Tristan would have liked to eavesdrop on that conversation, he had thinking to do.

They needed to cross the forest and bridge to get to the Trial of Ruins, and the obstacles in the way were greater than anticipated. His bet with the Red Eye warbands, that they would be split between the bridges and could be tricked through this, seemed to have paid off. It was the heliodoran beast he’d not counted on, and it made everything harder to predict. Men he could guess at, but beasts? He could not be sure when the monster would decide to wander off, what was keeping it here in the first place and how the cultists would react to its presence.

They were still around, Sanale had seen their warbands searching the tall grass when he went out hunting, but the Malani could only speak to the surroundings of the temple. He had, wisely, not gone further than that. Meanwhile the bridge was in the woods, further north. Were there cultists there as well, or had the heliodoran beast driven them all off? Would the warbands in the grass immediately head for the bridge when the lemure left, were they already clearing out west towards the other bridge? Too many questions he did not have answers to.

Instead of giving in to frustration, he followed Abuela’s lessons and instead attended to unknowns he could find the answer to. There was not mending his medicine cabinet, not with the tools on hand, but the thief set about taking inventory of what remained usable and fixing it up enough it wouldn’t spill everything out. Tristan had already taken a first look when seeing to wounds earlier, but a closer look gave grim answers. Most of what he had left were poisons, which had been kept deepest in: white arsenic, antimony, mandrake and volcian yew. The lodestone extract remained, as did the bearded cat extracts. Neither were mortal, the bearded cat being a mushroom whose extract caused violent bursts of madness in those who partook of it.

Aside from these, he only had the distilled alcohol and the medical turpentine he’d been using to treat his burns.

There was only so much he might accomplish with these. Putting his entire supply of volcian yew in a corpse might possibly inconvenience a beast the size of the airavatan if it ate it – the substance was a poison meant for lemures and lares – but it would not kill it. None of his other poisons would affect it all that much. He was unsure if the lodestone extract would have any effect, since he could not recall seeing a nose on the lemure, and the creature was already blood-mad so there was hardly a point to the bearded cat extract. He could spare neither the alcohol nor the turpentine.

“You’re pouting,” Fortuna teased.

So much activity in such close quarters had mercifully seen to it she did not need further entertainment. Being overly nosy tended to make up swaths of her day no matter where they were.

“I am low on tools,” Tristan murmured back.

And thinking about this wrong, he realized as his eyes moved to the others in the cavern. He did not need to attract the heliodoran beast directly when he could rely on someone else doing so. Dosing Ferranda Villazur with lodestone extract just before they parted ways was likely his best bet: killing the other lemures the scent would attract had a decent choice of attracting the greater monster. Meanwhile their own group could make a run for the bridge and gamble on the cultists not having returned to hold it yet. The issue, he figured, was that Lan might have revealed he had pulled this very trick on the infanzones already. If the pair were watching for it and caught him, the potential blowback could get him killed.

He needed to have a talk with Lan.

“And not paying enough attention,” Fortuna told him. “Sarai’s been whispering with that noble in a corner for half an hour now.”

And that, Tristan thought, might be a problem. When he turned to have a look at the two of them he found that Sarai was rising to her feet. Her gaze swept the cavern, lingering on him, and his stomach dropped. He could see where this was headed already. His companion did not waste much time, sparing only an amused look for the way he was sitting on his knees in his underclothes.

“We should talk,” Sarai told him. “Yong too.”

Tristan nodded, telling her he wanted to dress first to buy himself some time. Yong had struck a quick friendship with Sanale, which was good for them but less so for Tristan. He could guess which way the Tianxi would be leaning in the conversation to come. The five of them squeezed in around the small fire, given the run of the shrine by the others – Lan’s sly offer to tend the flames for them was politely refused – for at least a little while.

“I have been speaking with Sarai,” Lady Ferranda said, “and it appears both our groups are intending to make for the eastern bridge.”

Their plans had hardly been a secret and even if they had been Lan would already have sold them. Tristan had anticipated that Ferranda Villazur would learn this, that much was no surprise. What he had not anticipated was that an infanzona would deign to talk to a pale-skinned foreigner, getting a hook in one of the three people needing convincing before their groups could ally.

“It would only be sensible to attempt the crossing together,” Sarai said. “Between the cultists and the heliodoran beast, we need all the help we can get.”

Sanale met his employer’s gaze for a moment, then turned and shrugged his agreement. A glance at Yong’s face told Tristan that the Tianxi was about to agree.

“That may not be wise,” he slid in before Yong could speak. “A large group will make noise and draw attention.”

“I hardly think,” Ferranda wryly said, “that it will be us two making that noise.”

Yes, Tristan thought, but if you come with us I cannot use you as a distraction. His was a poor argument and he knew it, so he turned the talk around instead.

“It is true, the two of you would have a better chance of sneaking through alone,” the thief said. “Which has me wondering what you gain by joining us.”

If he could not defend, best to make the enemy do so instead. The Malani huntsman fixed him with a flat stare, his bead-covered coat open at the front.

“Blades and powder,” Sanale bluntly replied.

The thief almost grimaced. He’d lost that in a single exchange. Finesse could only get you so far against pure candour.

“Sarai is right, Tristan,” Yong cut in. “We need the help: I want two more sword arms with us if we stumble into a warband.”

And with Yong finally coming down on the side of the alliance, it was finished. Tristan did not rule their company, and though he was one of its leading figures so were the other two. If they agreed, there was little he could do except leave. Continuing to struggle would only lessen him in the eyes of the others, so it was best to capitulate and move on. At least he could try to wheedle information out of this.

“Then it is settled,” the thief said, shrugging his shoulders. “We make common cause to cross the bridge.”

Sarai nodded at him, pleased, and Yong only looked bemused he’d not agreed from the start. It was true that on the face of the alliance was a net benefit: their group had numbers, but they needed fighters. Meanwhile the pair had fighters but needed numbers, enough that they could not simply be overwhelmed by the hollows if they were caught by a warband. It was all too pretty, ever a sign that the story was yet young. Tristan did not doubt for a moment that Ferranda Villazur would sacrifice them the moment it gained her an edge, but that was fine.

He just had to do it to her first.

“In the spirit of friendship,” Sarai said, “Lady Ferranda has agreed to share information about the state of the trials for us.”

Ah, Tristan thought. So that was what she had bartered for when whispering with the infanzona in a corner.

“We encountered Lady Inyoni’s company before they went to fight their way through the western bridge,” Ferranda told them. “They had taken wounds and one of their number was lost.”

That was a surprise. Inyoni had been a grizzled old killer, a veteran, and the rest of her crew well-armed. Two more Malani of wealthy birth, a pair of Ramayans that’d proved skillful and that bland Aztlan woman made for an impressive crew, perhaps the finest fighting force to emerge from those brought by the Bluebell. That this was even doubt could be explained by two words: Angharad Tredegar.

“Lemures?” Tristan asked.

“Cultists,” the infanzona solemnly replied, shaking her head, “but they did not strike alone. Tupoc Xical and his three lackeys were with them.”

A round of grimaces followed that. Lan’s prediction that Tupoc meant to hunt them proving true was grim news.

“Their group rushed straight down the road,” Yong finally said. “They must have been the easiest to find.”

The blonde noble shook her head.

“That had been my guess as well, but Lady Inyoni is no fool: they took a detour west to shake pursuers,” Ferranda said. “It was on their way back to the road that they were attacked.”

Tristan frowned.

“Then how did the cultists find them?” he asked.

It would have been open grounds Inyoni’s travelled, but though darklings could see better in the dark – and some colours were known only to their kind – their sight was not perfect. A small group taking an indirect route would not have been easy to find.

“A tracking contract,” Sanale said.

Was that a sliver of disdain in the huntsman’s voice? Professional pride from a tracker, perhaps.

“It belongs to Lady Acanthe Phos, the pockmarked girl from Asphodel,” Ferranda continued. “Lady Inyoni’s nephew learned this through his own contract, but with Lan’s help I believe we learned how her contract functions.”

Tristan had been given the same information they had and found it was not much of a leap to make.

“Ash and bone,” he said. “Perhaps all human remains? Acanthe can track them once she has touched them, or something close to that.”

Ferranda nodded.

“I imagine they intrigued to plant ash on all of the groups,” she said. “I am surprised yours was not attacked.”

As was he, since theirs was the most vulnerable by far. Tupoc would not have been able to hit them immediately, he would need to first find the Red Eye cult and strike his bargain, but once he had they would have been the natural target. Their crew had been behind Inyoni’s, which had been the first to leave, and high in numbers while low on fighters. Perfect fodder for sacrifice. So why had Tupoc not focused his efforts on them? Perhaps he had not been able to.

Almost none of them had stood anywhere near Acanthe Phos, Tristan noted as he tried to recall their early days of the trial. And almost all of them had a single bag and bedroll, it would have been harder to hide a piece of bone there than within the bags of larger groups. As for ash… 

It occurred to Tristan, then, that he had passed some time walking besides Acanthe Phos and she had even once taken his arm. There was some kind of dust on the back of my sleeve, the thief suddenly remembered. Vanesa had thought it dust and soot when she cleaned his coat, but the lighting had been poor. It might well have been ash. The older woman had rid his arm of it quite thoroughly, though, and with a shiver the thief realized that Vanesa’s small act of motherly kindness might just have saved all their lives.

“We must,” he forced out, “have gotten lucky.”

Ferranda’s brow rose.

“The Manes were with you, then.”

Not eager to linger on how close they might just have come to getting killed, Tristan cleared his throat.

“Who was it that Inyoni’s crew lost, if I may ask?” he asked.

“Her nephew’s lover, the girl called Ayanda,” the infanzona said. “He was quite distraught over the loss.”

That the two younger Malani had been lovers was not something he had known, but neither was it a surprise. She had obviously not been kin to them, and there were only so many other things she could be.

“They were lucky only one died,” Tristan said.

There Ferranda scowled.

“We do not know for certain she is dead,” the blonde said. “Lady Inyoni said that hollows were careful to take her alive.”

“The Watch warned us,” Sanale evenly said. “They want sacrifices.”

Better she had died, Tristan thought, than whatever the cult of the Red Eye had in store for her. Poor girl. Yong, though sympathetic, kept the conversation moving.

“Do you know if they crossed the bridge successfully?” he asked.

“They did,” Ferranda said. “We held back and watched. Only there was trouble: they struck the cultists guarding it by surprise, but the fighting drew the heliodoran beast.”

Tristan blinked.

“Then they are all dead,” he slowly said.

“Before it could reach them, the beast fell into confusion,” the infanzona said. “The cultists scattered in fright and Lady Inyoni’s group fled north.”

Yong let out a low whistle.

“That sounds,” he said, “like a very dangerous contract. Do you know whose?”

Sanale shook his head.

“We were far,” he said.

Tristan’s interest, however, had been caught by another detail.

“The beast,” he said, “did it seem lethargic?”

Was this the contract that had been used on him when an attempt was made to frame him for Jun’s murder? The infanzona shrugged.

“As Sanale said,” she replied, “we were far. I can only tell you that when it came out of the daze and found no one around, it fell into a great rage.”

The noblewoman leaned forward.

“And as it rampaged, it shook the earth so strongly that the bridge collapsed,” Ferranda said.

Fuck, Tristan thought. The bet he’d thought had come true had, in a way: in reverse. Instead of the absence of people trying to cross the eastern bridge driving the hollow there to head west, it would be the other way around. All the warbands that had been prowling around the western bridge would be headed this way even as they spoke. Fuck, he thought again. No wonder Villazur had been so eager to make an alliance with them even when she had evidently split from the rest of the infanzones. The infanzone knew she needed to cross as soon as possible. The longer they waited, the more cultists would arrive.

Turning on the pair was no longer feasible, he decided. He must act accordingly.

“When the beast wandered off,” he said, “did it appear to be tracking the cultists who fled?”

Ferranda Villazur narrowed her eyes at him.

“It moved in the same direction as one of their groups,” she acknowledged, then her face hardened. “Are you perhaps thinking of using lodestone extract?”

There was a flat, accusatory note at the end. So Lan had talked. Ferranda’s displeasure was understandable: she had been among those his ploy was to burn, or perhaps even had burned. Regardless, Tristan met her brown eyes without shame.

“There is nothing to fear from me this time, Villazur,” he replied. “You are no longer attempting to use us as bait.”

He had acted out of vengeance, it was true, but also out of practicality. The infanzona’s lips thinned in anger, but she did not argue the point. They had owed each other nothing and it was not her the trick had been aimed at. Yong’s back had gone straight and his own gaze at the noblewoman was unimpressed, so Tristan was not without support.

“Airavatan see odours,” Sanale brusquely said. “It could work.”

Tristan’s eyes swivelled to the hunter.

“Lodestone extract smells like blood to lemures, but it is not actually blood,” he carefully said. “Would that still fool it?”

The huntsman hesitated, then nodded. Tristan would have preferred greater certainty but sensed it was the best he would get.

“Then we might be able to distract it,” the thief said.

“It may chase us from there,” Ferranda warned.

“Better to have it somewhere we know than to be left wondering where it is,” Yong replied.

“We could try to attract it near the cultists,” Sarai said. “It would keep them both occupied while we make for the bridge.”

The thief blinked at her. That was… bold, to say the least. He passed his hand through his hair, considering it just as the others were.

“It would be playing with fire,” Tristan finally said. “If they catch us planting the extract, if we get bogged down fighting them…”

None of them had forgot the massacre of the entire first wave of trial-takers in exactly such a situation. Or that Inyoni and her crew might well have suffered the same fate if they’d not had a contract that let them escape.

“We would need to find a Red Eye encampment for that plan to be an option at all,” Yong pragmatically said. “That means going out to look.”

“We need to do that regardless,” Ferranda pointed out. “We cannot afford to rush in blindly, not with the forces arrayed against us.”

She was right, Tristan thought, and it was plain enough to see that no one argued. The talk instead turned to who would be going. Yong volunteered, brushing aside the thief’s worries about how his shoulder was healing. The wound had not torn muscle or required stitches – the gravebird had been toying with him – so the Tianxi insisted he was fine.  Ferranda conferred with Sanale away from the fire, which surprised Tristan: it implied their relation was more nuanced than that of an infanzona and her hired hand.

“I will be going,” Ferranda said when they returned. “Two of us will be enough – any more and the chances of getting caught by a warband grow too high.”

And aside from Sanale, Tristan thought, no one else among them was practiced at forestry. He was decent at sneaking around, but even tall grass such as the one around the swamp was uncomfortably different from the alleys and rooftops of Sacramonte. It was agreed on without quibbling, the dangers headed their way cooling any desire for argument, and after that all that they broke the news to the rest of their company: if Yong and Lady Ferranda came back with the right news, then they would be attempting the crossing tonight.

—

Everyone began to pack the moment the pair disappeared into the passage.

The mood was subdued, even Felis keeping his peace. Though from the suddenly loose shoulders on the man, Tristan figured that might have something to do with licking up some dust. The thief wondered what it was that Lan had demanded of him in exchange. As for the Meng-Xiaofan dealer, his idle suggestion that she be left behind had been refused. She had, it seemed, bought Lady Ferranda’s agreement to let her follow them until the second trial with information after stumbling onto the pair by pure chance. Tristan would not call a woman who’d lost a sister only days ago lucky, but the gods must have taken a shine to Lan for her to make it that far.

That, or she had been sitting quiet on a contract.

Just between them rats, he could admire how well she had played her rather lacking cards. Lan was a poor fighter, had displayed no contract and was openly unreliable in the face of danger. Yet with only wits and a penchant for digging into other people’s things, she had been able to bargain her way to safety again and again. That was something worthy of respect, even if he did not particularly like the woman. Respect and some wariness: neither were the kind of people to hold a grudge over the kind of clawing they’d done at one another, but it would not do to forget that they were far from friendly.

About a quarter hour into packing his belongings Sarai came to find him. It was idle chatter at first, but he noticed she was keeping an eye on how close other people were. As soon as she was sure no one could overhear, the talk changed.

“You meant to use the lodestone trick again,” Sarai quietly said. “On them. It’s why you were against us allying.”

It was tempting to lie, but he bit down on the instinct. He had already extended trust. He would not keep doing so blindly, but withdrawing it just as blindly would be equally foolish.

“It struck me as the most likely plan to work,” Tristan said.

“It was a wash the moment they got Lan to talk,” she replied, shaking her head.

The dark-haired woman looked uncomfortable.

“I thought your enmity was with the Cerdan,” she continued. “Not all infanzones.”

The thief hesitated again, but he could see what silence would cost him here. No one wanted an ally that was a rabid hound, which murderous hatred of all the nobles of Sacromonte might as well make him.

“It is Cozme Aflor I most want dead,” he admitted. “The brothers are ledger work, payment against an old debt.”

“And Ferranda Villazur?” Sarai pressed.

“I have little against her,” he shrugged. “I believed the pair would go their own way, which made them a sensible target.”

“You still opposed the alliance when I was bringing it forward,” she pointed out.

“And I still would, had I not learned of the other bridge’s breaking,” Tristan frankly replied. “People will die in this crossing, Sarai. If I have a choice, I would rather it be them than us.”

All the Red Eye warbands rushing their way tilted the odds against anyone being able to sneak through, enough so that additional swords were worth more than a distraction. If the pair could be used for their blades and other dupes used as a distraction, Sarai’s suggestion, then that plan was superior. But it was also only viable now that they had skilled trackers other than Yong out trying to find darkling encampments. Sending out alone a wounded Yong, who even in such a state was their best fighter, would have been rolling on bad odds. Sending a potential liability with him would have been even worse. Sarai’s blue eyes stayed on him, then she slowly nodded.

“Good,” she said.

Worth staying allied with, she meant. He would not say he was relieved, but neither would he deny it.

“Ferranda parted ways with the other nobles before your lodestone trick had effect,” Sarai said. “Their plan was to climb the High Road using a contract and then march across the island unhindered, but there is no telling if lemures attacked them first.”

Tristan almost cursed. Of course the infanzones had come in with a cushy plan that put them right out of harm’s way while everyone else died beneath them. Lodestone extract would largely stop smelling after a day, so if they had made it up on the aqueduct they would be safe by now. There would be no telling until the second trial, then. And there I will have to act, or they will be able to slip away before the third.

“One more reason to make it to the Trial of Ruins,” he simply replied.

He made sure to incline his head in thanks, acknowledging that she had most likely looked into the fate of the Cerdans for him. She smiled back, flicking his shoulder.

“Mayhaps we’ll be lucky and they’ll have eaten at least one out of three,” she said.

The thief smiled back, almost wonderingly. Not so much at the thought as how she had said it: we’ll get lucky. Not only him. The implicit promise there, without her having ever asked why he wanted any of them dead, was… Measure for measure, that was how Sarai dealt. He had told her the truth of what he wanted, so she had offered her help in achieving it. There was something so terrifyingly straightforward about that he ended up shying away from meeting her eyes. She had an ulterior purpose in these trials, he reminded himself, had admitted as much.

It would be dangerous to begin trusting her too much.

Sensing the mood had changed, Sarai took her leave. It left Tristan to finish packing his bag and rearranging the broken cabinet so that nothing would come out spilling were it dropped. Left him alone with his thoughts, also, or more accurately his thoughts and one more thing.

“She would make a good priestess, I think,” Fortuna mused. “You must ask her if she gambles.”

The goddess was sprawled theatrically across a flat stone, red dress flowing down artfully as she rested her chin against her palm. She was the very picture of imperial leisure, missing only servants to fan her and feed her grapes.

“Of course,” he lied.

Golden eyes narrowed at him.

“Are you pouting again?” the goddess asked. “You know, it is only charming if done once in a while. Otherwise is the province of toddlers.”

He rolled his eyes at her.

“It is only unease, not pouting,” Tristan said. “I feel…”

Fortuna snorted.

“I knew you’d get like this about someone actually liking you,” she smugly said. “It’s all the amusement you refuse me when you get stab wounds.”

Tristan made sure no one was looking his way before glaring at her.

“You’re inventing things,” he insisted. “This has nothing to do with Sarai.”

“I never said her name,” Fortuna smirked.

“It was implied, you pile of bad decisions,” he hissed back. “It’s this plan, Fortuna, it is all wrong.”

The goddess gracefully shifted into a sitting position, legs over the edge of the stone, and her mood turned serious so swiftly he had no idea if she had been faking the taunting before it. Gods, she had always been like this. Sometimes she made him feel like he was still a boy.

“What about it rubs you wrong?” she asked.

Having to answer her forced him to think it out, to truly look at what it was that bothered him.

“It is not the kind of method I like using,” Tristan finally said. “It is barely a plan. It relies on assumptions, even if it works perfectly it will be risky and we are making too little use of the time we have before it begins.”

The last, he thought, might be the one that most went against the grain. Thievery was about waiting for the right moment, but that moment had to be found. It was not an orange falling into your lap. Too much was being left to chance and too little done to change this.

“Then do something about it,” Fortuna shrugged, languidly rising to her feet.

The dress followed, a trail of blood slinking after the goddess. She smirked at him again, strolling away like there was nothing more than say. The part he might be most resentful about, Tristan admitted to himself, was that she had helped. There were still hours left before they moved out, if they made the attempt tonight, and he did not have spend them sitting by his broken cabinet and silently fretting.

So what could he do?

His eyes swept across the cavern, lingering on the rest of the company before dismissing them. It would not be impossible to pulls tricks to tighten or loosen alliances – Lan and Felis were easy levers – but there would be no point. All of them wanted to survive, it would keep them together and looking outwards until there was a semblance of safety. Their remaining supplies were food, water, powder and bedrolls. None of which could be put to particularly unusual use.

His gaze stopped on the carved doorway of the shrine, the great chain of silhouettes grasping the feet of those in front of them. Tristan was, at the end of the day, a thief. Why was he trying to be a general or a conspirator? Better that he use the skills he had actually learned. First, to case the place. Whoever had built this was long dead and buried, that was not the end of it. It so happened that Tristan had someone on hand who could get answers from beyond the grave.

“It might be as old as the First Empire,” Francho said, stroking his white stubble. “Not of Antediluvian make, of course – it is much too humble for that – but still build before the Old Night.”

If he let that beard grow, it would not be long before he had more hair on his chin than his head.

“So what was it for?” Tristan asked. “To honour some god?”

“Religion before the Orthodoxy was very haphazard, as far as we can tell,” the toothless old professor mused. “The Universalist creed from the Isles is probably closest to what it looked like.”

“And that means,” the grey-eyed man encouraged.

Francho blinked.

“Temples to a god were rare,” he said. “They were more along the lines of designated sacred places, grounds where mortals and gods might meet and give each other gifts if it pleased them.”

“So there might still be a gift left,” Tristan said. “If it was hidden well enough.”

“This shrine was abandoned centuries before Sacromonte was a fishing village, my boy,” Francho gently said, fighting down his cough. “If there was ever anything here of worth, it is long gone.”

But the old man was thinking as a historian, and that was not the right way here. This was the Dominion of Lost Things, not some glittering temple on the Tower Coast. The island had been full of hollows and worse ever since anyone could remember, and while the temple above had been looted this shrine was much older. It had not been so well hidden the darklings would not have looted it, but how hard had they really looked? It would have seemed a small and dingy place, compared to the great painted temple above. And this was not the kind of place treasure hunters would come to even if it had not been Watch territory, which made it even more off-limits.

“There can be no harm in looking,” Tristan said. “Is there a part that would be more sacred than the rest?”

Francho sighed.

“The ceiling,” the old man said. “What scarce records we have of the era imply that in many parts of Vesper firmament was feared and worshipped in equal measure.”

Tristan thanked him, the professor visibly forcing himself not to roll his eyes out of exasperation. Only Sanale sat within the shrine, tending to the last of the fire, and he did not spare the thief more than a glance. The insides were as plain as the outside, for all that the clever stonework tried to hide it. The arches and columns that stood out of the wall slightly were pure affectation, no more useful a support than any other carving might have been, and they led up to a high curved ceiling that was just slightly too uneven to truly count as a dome. Up there were circular stripes of stone standing out, whatever had been displayed on them worn away or covered by the black taint of smoke.

At the apex of the almost-dome was a full circle of the same motif as the threshold, silhouettes grabbing the feet of others, and a hole in the stone the size of a man’s head. It went up, like a pipe, and was the reason a fire could be lit in a place small as this shrine without choking everyone inside. On the ground there were three broken altars, or so he guessed: most the stone was gone, likely stolen by hollows. What few pieces remained were being used by Ferranda and her hired hand to dry their clothes. Lifting a shirt under Sanale’s watchful gaze revealed that their stone was covered with carvings.

Still the silhouettes.

“What are you doing?” Sanale asked.

The man was looking at him with a frown.

“Looting the shrine,” Tristan frankly replied.

The huntsman considered that, then nodded.

“Good luck.”

The thief grinned back, then let his gaze drift back up. Francho had said the ceiling would be important, but even without the old man Tristan would have begun with looking there. It would have been the most difficult part of this shrine to make, and in the builder’s place he would have been certain to add in a secret alcove or two. Climbing wasn’t difficult beyond the strain it put on his burns, which was enough for the thief to be swallowing a hiss. Anchoring his foot against the side of the ‘column’, he hoisted himself up to have a look at the first stone stripe jutting out of the ceiling. It was, he found with surprise, also adorned with the silhouette chain. Only the top of the stripe, so it could not be seen from below, but the motif seemed to be circling around the near-dome ceiling.

Ignoring Sanale’s gaze, and now the people crowding the shrine entrance looking at him, the thief dragged his left foot up on top of one of the sculpted arcs and used the leverage to pull himself further up. From there he had a better vantage of the stripes, which he saw were all carved with the chain in the same place. And there was a detail to it: the way the chain was facing, it seemed to be encircling the ceiling through the stripes. Circling upwards like a spring.

“Francho,” he called out.

The old man brushed past Lan to come into the shrine, looking as if he did not know whether to be impressed or appalled.

“You are going to break a leg for the grand prize of dust,” the professor told him.

The thief ignored that with the practiced ease of a man living bound to a goddess that could not be silenced.

“There’s a pattern to it,” he said. “I need you to look at the carvings outside, around the door. Is there are beginning and an end to the chain?”

Francho sighed but did look intrigued. More importantly he inspected the carvings as he’d been asked, returning with surprise on his face.

“There is both,” he said. “And the ‘end’ sneaks past the top of the threshold as a small line, continuing inside as a carving behind a ridge.”

“Where does it lead?” Tristan asked

His arms were beginning to cramp but he held himself tight.

“The floor, and then nowhere,” the old man said. “It is still a dead end.”

Now, maybe, but had it always been? The tiles in the temple upstairs had been ripped off the floor and walls, so it might well have been the same down here. A part of the chain was gone, but perhaps not all of it.

“The altars,” Tristan said. “They have markings too, see where they lead.”

Sanale was interested enough by the spectacle to agree to remove the drying clothes, but Francho clicked his tongue after going around looking at them. Their labour had, Tristan saw from the corner of his eye, drawn most everyone else as an audience. A few looked excited, more amused.

“Too much is gone,” the scholar said. “The altars connected to each other, I think, and perhaps headed for the back wall. I cannot be certain with what little is left.”

The back wall was something Tristan could work with. From up there he could see what the angle might have been, and there was a carved column leading into an arch facing more or less where the altars would have been. Moving in that direction across the top of the arches, he crouched down to have a closer look. No trace of the chain anywhere near the ground, but ah! Atop the curve of the arch, under dust he rubbed away with his thumb, he found the carved chain. The bottom was worn away, but it was facing upwards: towards the first of the stone strips encircling the dome.

“Found it,” Tristan triumphantly said.

It had been as he suspected: the chain began outside, passed through the altars and then slowly rose up the ‘sky’ only to lead at a final destination: the smoke hole, which might have another purpose after all.

“What is it that you are even looking for?” Francho asked.

“You said shrines like this were for trading gifts,” the thief said. “And it occurs to me: if the first silhouette is standing on the ground and all the others are holding up another body, what will the last one be holding up?”

The toothless professor was not slow.

“There might be a gift for the gods at the end,” Francho mused. “Symbolically speaking, that is not without sense.”

The difficult part was getting up there, as the old man’s warning had not been unsound: if he fell badly from this height the thief would break something. Getting a hand into the smoke hole took more acrobatics than he would prefer: feet resting on the highest stripe, his hand on a jutting stone of the ceiling to wedge himself and then all he could do was peer in the dark above. Shoving in his free hand, he groped around in search of anything at all. It seemed like a dead end, just a hole going upwards, until he pressed against the back and found there was a little give. Not much, though. Inspired, he ran his fingers near the bottom of the stone and found a carved silhouette offering up nothing.

Pressing against it, he felt a stone give and suddenly the back wall toppled.

Tristan yelped, taking back his hand as the stone fell out and down into the shrine. Francho shouted a curse when it almost fell on his head, but the thief’s attention was on the hidden compartment he had revealed. Though he could not see inside, he could feel it out. There was some kind of basin carved into the bottom, a sloping incline, but after he felt out all the sides and even the top of the compartment Tristan was forced to admit that it was empty. Either the caretakers of this place had taken away their treasure or someone had found it before he could. Enthusiasm dimming, thief carefully made his way down.

He still slipped, footing giving away against the side of the column, but by then he was close enough to the ground he was able to fall without even a bruise to show for it. Still hurt, though, almost as much as Francho’s gentle smile as the thief rose to his feet and brushed himself off.

“I told you it was unlikely,” the professor said. “Besides, it is already impressive that you found the hidden compartment.”

In sharp contrast to the old man’s attempt at comfort, Tristan saw from the corner of his eye that Fortuna’s head was popping out of the smoke hole. Long golden hair falling like a curtain, she still somehow managed to look down at them contemptuously. Like some queen granting audience to vagabonds, Tristan thought, and that was when it fell into place.

“The chain goes both ways,” the thief said, cutting through whatever Francho had been saying.

The old man frowned.

“Obsessing over this will do you no good,” he said.

Tristan turned grey eyes on him.

“You said it yourself,” he said.  “The gods gave gifts as well as received them. If there was something at the end of the chain, there should be something at the beginning too.”

He would have been willing to look for the first link in the chain himself, but despite his open doubts Francho led him to it. The small carved silhouette had its feet against the ground of the cavern, as if standing on it, and when Tristan pressed against it nothing gave. He blew at the carving, finding that there were the smallest fracture lines between that first silhouette and the stone around it. It could have been time’s work, he thought. But it might not be. Leaning closer, he ran a finger beneath the carved feet and it came back touched with grey stone dust. Greyer than the stone of the cavern wall. To someone’s loudly exclaimed disgust, he tasted it. Ha! He’d been sure he knew that grey.

“There is nothing,” Francho said. “Surely you can see-”

Tristan took out his knife, picking away at the carved silhouette until some a chunk of the left leg fell off. Beneath it lay stone of a different grey. The old man wetly coughed into his hand, his breath wheezing.

“Is that what I think it is?” Francho said, voice still faint.

“If you are thinking ‘antipodal stone’, then yes,” the thief smiled.

Vanesa was standing close, a lantern in hand, and when Tristan asked she wordlessly gave it over. He opened the shutter until the naked flame was revealed, then pressed it against the carving. Antipodal stone was believed to be one of the wonders of the Antediluvians for it was a stone that, unlike others, contracted when heated instead of expanding. Some of the great canals of Sacromonte had been built out of it, in times before it became so rare, so Tristan knew the look of the stone. It was not long before he estimated it would be warm enough, the scorched figure of the silhouette hot to the touch but not so much that with his sleeve covering his fingers he could not pull at it. The stone came free when he pulled, revealing another compartment, and Tristan grinned.

“I was wrong,” Francho murmured. “Most in error.”

The thief angled the lantern to have a look inside, triumph blooming when he saw there was an object in there. It was large enough he had to grope at the inside of the compartment for another mechanism, eventually finding out that the sides of the ‘mouth’ could be pushed further open. What he took out of the compartment looked like a musical instrument of some sort, though not one he knew. It was squatter and longer than a lyre, and its wooden body had long petrified. Strangest, though, was that though where nubs for seven strings on the crossbar there were not even the broken remains of one. Tristan pulled it up into the light, feeling something move inside the body when he did.

Lightly, and it was near weightless, but there was definitely something within.

“That,” Francho quietly said, “is a supplicant’s cithara.”

They had attracted a crowd, everyone circling in around them. The thief hid how the number of people behind him was making him uncomfortable.

“A musical instrument?” Tristan asked.

“One meant only for the hands of priests,” the professor explained. “It is played with strings of Gloam, to appeal to the gods with prayer-songs.”

“So it’s worth a lot?” Lan asked, leaning past Vanesa.

More than a few considering gazes turned on the cithara at the question.

“That depends on the nature of the relic,” Francho hedged. “But by itself not particularly, save to collectors.”

He coughed into his hand.

“But inside the cithara’s body there will be a substance,” he said. “It will have been laid there by the priests who crafted it to shape the nature of the prayers, accumulating power with use. That can be worth a great deal of coin.”

Tristan raised an eyebrow, pressing the cithara into his hand. The professor looked askance at him for a moment, as if wondering what the meaning of it might be.

“The wood is petrified,” the thief said. “Turned to stone.”

And Francho could listen to the echoes lying within stone, could he not? The old man looked startled, then his face pulled into a frown of concentration as he laid an open palm against the cithara. He shivered, arm trembling, and withdrew his hand with a long sigh.

“Feathers,” Francho told him. “It is feathers inside, meant for songs of sleep.”

And so by the time Song and Ferranda returned, bringing word they had found cultists and so their group was to try the bridge tonight, Tristan Abrascal was smiling.

He had a plan.

# Chapter 14

They began to feel the bite of the missing supplies on the third day.

Angharad had measured her portions from the start, planning for four days’ worth of meals. Formal registration with the duelling circuit had exempted her from ever having to attend isikole, the mandatory four-year schooling, but Mother had seen to it she received some of the training nonetheless. She had not enjoyed the lessons then but now she saw the use what she’d learned going out into the countryside: how to make a fire, skin an animal and ration her food. Her portions remained the same, but those who had not been as prudent paid for it. Isabel’s maids, in particular the redhead, ate little but crumbs for breakfast. That would not do.

Angharad cut her meal in half, then in half again, and wordlessly gave a quarter to each.

“Thank you,” Beatris sincerely said, bowing her head.

“It is very kind of you,” Briceida added.

The sheer gratitude on their faces made her uncomfortable. She snuck a look at Isabel, who was chatting with the Cerdan brothers as she ate her own meal. It would not have been proper for the mistress to suffer on the behalf of careless servants, it was true, but the dark-haired beauty should have kept a closer eye on her maids in the first place. Though neither Brun nor Song were anything of the sort to her, Angharad had inquired as to their own meals the previous day. Brun had been most amused by her concern, informing her he’d eaten worse in smaller plates, while Song’s rationing had been even more strict than her own.

Neither of the Cerdan brothers seemed to be running out of food, even though they had been eating larger meals than anyone else. Even Master Cozme, whose plate was usually not much larger than Angharad’s.

“Ah, infanzones,” Brun smiled, looking at them. “Not a breed of men prone to wastefulness, it must be said: they’ve already spent poor Gascon’s life and now they eat his food.”

“Supplies are supplies,” Song pragmatically replied. “It is the extravagance that irks me.”

Angharad could not quite say why it was wrong for the Augusto and Remund Cerdan to eat the rations of the valet one of them had murdered, but it was. It did not matter that the food was theirs, or that the man who might have had a claim to it had passed. It was wrong. She stewed on that for the rest of breakfast. After all were done, Song brought up the notion that since food was beginning to run out all should pitch in their provisions for a common stash that would be rationed out fairly between everyone.

“A Tianxi proposing theft from her betters,” Remund Cerdan sneered. “How very surprising.”

“No doubt she’ll expect us to vote on it,” his older brother laughed.

“We already share the lantern oil,” Brun pointed out. “It is only going a step further.”

The decision had been made unanimously when it became clear they were running out of oil. They had lost four lanterns fighting off the lupines so only three were left, but the greater loss had been the skins full of oil. Now there was so little left they had killed two lanterns and let only the vanguard of their group carry one that was lit, lest they run the risk of running out before they even left the High Road. Having only the light of the stars to walk by would have been dangerous enough, but the prospect of Gloam disease was even more fearful than that.

“It is always only a step further, boy,” Augusto lectured, “until we kneel with our necks on the chopping block.”

Angharad frowned at them.

“There has been no talk of violence or taking from anyone, only an offer to contribute to a common good,” she said.

“It is not for nobles to fill the world’s empty bellies,” Remund dismissed. “We will run out of loaves long before we run out of beggars: the commons must take responsibility for themselves.”

The Pereduri did not hide her disgust. Did Remund Cerdan not understand what being a noble was? All men had a trade, a vocation under the Sleeping God, and to be born a noble was to learn the trade of leadership, the burden of command. To then let your own go hungry was a fundamental failure of that duty. More disappointingly, the Cerdans were not alone in their opinion.

“My handmaids are free to join such an arrangement if they wish,” Isabel said, “but I will not. I will see to my affairs without needing the help of others.”

The offer was the nail in the coffin of Song’s proposal, for now neither she nor Brun were inclined to continue the plan. The maids had nothing to contribute to the pot, meaning in practice they would be fed at the expense of those who filled it. Angharad understood she had no right to expect the two of them to take food off their plates for strangers, but for all that everyone had their good and proper reasons the result was still that two of their company would go hungry. The selfishness of it all was cloying. She rose brusquely to her feet, anger caught in her throat.  

“It is not much,” Angharad stiffly told the maids, “but I will share again at supper what I did for this meal.”

The three of them would go hungry, but hunger passed. Dishonour would not. Isabel smiled at her but Angharad’s answering gaze was cool as she went to grab her back. Sometimes people were less than you had thought them to be.

—

After they resumed the march it was not entirely a surprise when Isabel joined her at the back. Angharad was yet under oath, she could not have approached the other herself. With Song and Beatris walking in front of them while Augusto and Remund Cerdan took the vanguard far ahead, they even had a modicum of privacy.

“I will be sharing half my meals with them as well, Angharad,” the infanzona quietly told her. “But it would have served no good to shame the brothers before everyone.”

She studied Isabel from the corner of her eye, wondering if she was being appeased. No, she decided. Isabel was not scheming, only too prone to playing the peacemaker even when the other side was undeserving of compromise. It was a flaw born of kindness, not something baser.

“Speaking for your own is your responsibility,” she finally said. “Your maids deserve better than silence.”

Irritation flashed in the infanzona’s green eyes.

“They might,” Isabel sharply replied, “but I imagine they yet prefer being on speaking terms with the man whose contract is the sole way for us to get down from this aqueduct.”

Angharad had not considered that, she would admit, but duty was duty.

“It is a matter of honour,” she said. “Nobles have obligations, Isabel.”

“There is honour in keeping everyone breathing,” the infanzona retorted “And that means keeping the brothers happy. Do you not understand that every time one of them has the watch they could simply leave us?”

Isabel swallowed, obviously distressed.

“Angharad, they could take the food and the lanterns and go,” she said, snapping her fingers. “Just like that, leaving us stranded. And why wouldn’t they? You swore to kill one of them and Song’s map has lost its use. There is only one reason for them to stay.”

The woman they were both courting, Isabel did not need to say, and Angharad felt her anger ebb away. It would have been a fine thing to say that she’d been convinced by the soundness of the argument, and it genuinely was sound! Open contempt from the woman they were courting might well drive the brothers away just as Isabel feared. But the truth was that the tremor in Isabel’s voice and the fear on her face did more to convince Angharad to let go of her indignation than all the rest. Who was she to cast blame, when she had not even noticed the burden laying on the infanzona’s shoulders?

“It will be all right,” she quietly said, laying gentle a hand on the Isabel’s wrist. “Only one more day to the end of the High Road, and then they will have no power over us.”

She let out a long breath, leaning into Angharad’s shoulder.

“I am tired,” she admitted. “And afraid. None of it has gone the way I thought it would.”

“My uncle told me it would be a hard journey,” Angharad said, “but it has been trying in different ways than I had expected.”

“So it has,” Isabel snorted, pushing back a curl. “To think we could be at risk of Gloam disease in this day and age.”

“We will not be for some time,” Angharad absent-mindedly replied.

Curious green eyes turned on her.

“You know of the process?”

“My mother was a sea captain,” she replied. “Few know the terror of that disease better than sailors.”

Particularly those who sailed the Straying Sea, which unlike the Trebian had no light shined down on it from firmament. Only the royal house’s great triumph, the Serpentine Roads, dared to cut through that once-unbroken darkness.

“It takes seven days entirely without Glare or a month with less than two hours a day exposed for the disease to take,” Angharad continued. “So long as we keep eating our meals under lantern light and keeping watch with the same, we are not at risk.”

“I have heard Malani studied the disease more deeply than any other,” Isabel hesitantly said. “That they have measured what it does to men.”

“The basics are common knowledge back home,” she admitted.

Clearing her throat, she pitched her voice higher.

“Seven dead and one alive, the last in dark to thrive,” Angharad sang.

All children of the Isles were taught the nursery rhyme. Malani scholars had found that out of ten men who contracted Gloam disease, the results cut towards an average: seven would die, two turn darkling and one survive. Mother had always said that the hollowing was more common than that, however, and that sometimes those headed for death could be saved if they were bathed in direct Glare for long enough – the burning light that straight fell from the cracks in firmament, not the gentler glow of Antediluvian devices. Isabel shivered against her.

“What a dreadful verse,” Isabel murmured, “but I suppose it lays out the endings plain.”

“It is meant to be sobering,” Angharad said, slipping her arm into the other woman’s and squeezing it. “That way children remember to stay out of the Gloam, especially in the countryside.”

Malan and its sister-islands, Peredur and Uthukile, were not under a part of firmament where the Antediluvians had built wonders. It was only a great pit of Glare that made the islands habitable, and that light was not as sophisticated as that of lands with older blessings. Between the shadows cast by the lay of the land and the Challenger – that great wandering machine high up in the sky – cutting through the light, there was no end of nooks and crannies where a careless soul might find a bad end.

“It is not natural to stay out of the light for too long,” Isabel agreed. “It presses against the soul of all those not estranged from the Circle Perpetual.”

“We have been weathering it fine for now, I would say,” Angharad replied.

Isabel prettily smiled, then leaned close. For a golden, terrifying heartbeat Angharad thought she was about to be kissed but instead the infanzona tugged her coat into place.

“There, that’s better,” Isabel said, smirking in a way that told she knew exactly what she’d just done.

Angharad cleared her throat. She had not blushed, at least.

“Thank you,” she got out.

“It is nothing,” she airily replied. “If you must thank me for anything, let it be for this: we are not all taking to the dark as well you think. Your helper Brun, for example.”

“He is not a helper,” the Pereduri said, “but a companion.”

“A companion who does all you ask him to and keeps the same foes,” Isabel drily replied. “But call him a companion if you like – the reluctance is part of your charm, I think.”

Angharad was not sure whether she was flattered or insulted, but either way she pushed through.

“Brun has been well enough,” she finally said. “Why do you believe otherwise?”

“He puts on a good show when we have meals, or when he is paired with someone else,” Isabel conceded. “Even when he speaks with dear Briceida. Yet the moment he is not, a black mood takes him.”

Angharad’s brows rose in surprise.

“Not a speck of emotion on his face,” Isabel continued, “and he grows restless. Always reaching for that hatchet of his while the eye wanders.”

“I had no notion,” she admitted.

“I doubt he would take well to an attempt to comfort,” the infanzona noted. “Men rarely do, from a woman whose skirts they are not trying to slide under. I mention it only so you might keep an eye on him.”

“I will,” Angharad swore.

Brun had been good and kind, she would not repay these things by letting the Gloam have him. While the eponymous sickness was some of the worst of what the dark held in store, it was hardly the only illness born of it. Most of them were of the mind: it was not rare for men to go mad, in pieces or all at once, for the lack of light.

“Good,” Isabel smiled. “You are one of the pillars of this company, after all. It would not do for you to act otherwise.”

“You overestimate my influence,” Angharad dismissed.

“Do I?” the green-eyed beauty said. “Around you gathers the capacity for much violence, Angharad. Two fine fighters and then yourself. There is a reason I believe the brothers would flee, not attempt to fight you for the reins of power.”

“Even if that were true,” she said, “what has it helped? I agreed with Song, this morning, that we should share the food. It did no good.”

“I usually find, when I am refused, that I simply did not ask the right way,” Isabel said.

Angharad shot the infanzona an amused look. Yes, she did not find it all that difficult to believe that few would refuse her much of anything. Only the amusement faded when she found Isabel meeting her gaze squarely, a look almost unkind in them. No, Angharad thought, not unkind. It was the same she had seen on some of the tutors Mother arranged for, men and women who’d agreed to meet to Angharad only out of courtesy for the reputation of the famed Captain Tredegar. She’d had to prove she was worth their time, their lessons.

She had been tested then and she was being tested now.

Wrenching her gaze away, she kept her eyes peeled ahead. She had not asked the right way, according to Isabel, but she could not see the Cerdans agreeing to anything she proposed. She had struck a bargain with Remund and he had become friendlier in the shallowest of manners since, but that did not make them of one mind. Cozme Aflor was unlikely to intercede on her behalf either, and Isabel had made it clear she could not afford to openly pick a side. There was a saying in Peredur, that a man’s name had two halves: his deepest regret and his heart’s desire. To know either was to own half his name, to know both was to have him bound as tightly as any spirit.

So what was it the Cerdan brothers wanted, that she could use it against them?

They wanted to inherit, badly enough to strike deals with enemies to rid themselves of their rival. Badly enough that Master Cozme was here as much to protect them from one another as the trials themselves. Only Angharad had already made bargains using that desire, and to use a lever too much was to break it. Could she muster Song and Brun to try to force the notion? Perhaps, but there was no guarantee it would work – more likely the confrontation would drive the infanzones away in the night. It could not come from her, Angharad decided. She was the enemy, even to the Cerdan she had made alliance with.

The silence lingered between she and Isabel, enough to unsettle her, but the infanzona waited without a word or a trace of boredom on her face. Quietly expectant, and so Angharad forced her mind down furrows she had already dug. If not from her, then from who? Isabel had dismissed Brun as being her helper, and though she was wrong in this the brothers might share that opinion. That barred either he or Song from being an answer. That left only the maids and Isabel, for the brothers were unlikely to willingly get food off their plate on behalf of people they largely disliked and held in contempt. Did they even like anyone of their company save Isabel?

And there Angharad stilled, for the brother did indeed like Isabel. Perhaps even loved her, though she had her doubts. One of the reasons the Cerdan brothers were so ardently courting Isabel Ruesta was the wealth of the infanzona’s house, which making ties to would surely see the earner rise above his brother to inherit their family’s title. It was a shade of the heart’s desire, half the name seized by a different grip, and the openings were all there weren’t they? Angharad carefully put the pieces together in her mind. Isabel’s maids had been given permission to join the ‘arrangement’ of shared food, and Isabel was going to share part of her meal with them.

All that needed doing was to nudge the events a little further along.

“Have you considered,” Angharad said, “giving your entire meals to your maids?”

Surprise flicked across the other woman’s face, a flash of it followed by Isabel breathing in sharply and releasing a little laugh.

“Oh,” she said. “That is clever.”

It was the Pereduri’s turn to start.

“You were not leading me towards such a solution?” she slowly asked.

“Not at all, darling,” Isabel chuckled. “There were other ways, but I really should not be surprised this is what you thought of.”

She shook her head with wry amusement.

“It is all very Malani, yes? The lady gives away her meals to her servants, noble in deed, and naturally when she ends up without anything the lords courting her will fight for the privilege of providing. Gallantry all around, with just a hint of the mercenary sensibilities lying beneath.”

The last sentence she spoke with open approval, which had Angharad grimacing. Not, however, disagreeing. That was the ugly truth of the words exact, the one her father had made sure to teach her: if you cleaved only to the letter of honour, honour had a way of ending up being what was most advantageous to you. No matter how callous or cruel. When the Father of Devils appeared in the Great Tales, the King of Hell never spoke a single lie or broke a single oath. It made Lucifer no less dangerous: a single whisper from him had been enough to turn Issay the Great, first and finest king of Malan, into a bloodthirsty tyrant.

She was broken out of her ruminations by Isabel laying a head against her shoulder.

“You are prone to brooding, Angharad,” she said. “We will have to fix that.”

“How ambitious of you,” she drawled back, “when we will only have so long together. Until the end of the second trial is not so long, my lady.”

“Oh, my life will not end after the Trial of Ruins,” Isabel flirted back. “It is why I want to take it in the first place, darling.”

She flicked a meaningful glance ahead.

“With such an achievement to my name, my parents will allow me greater latitude to choose who I may tie myself to,” Isabel said.

“A cause worth fighting for,” Angharad replied, only half jesting.

“I thought you might say that,” Isabel Ruesta smiled, green eyes warm with promise.

—

There was only so long the two of them could nestle against one another at the back of the company without being seen, so when lunch grew close they reluctantly parted ways. Perhaps it was for the best, Angharad thought, for if she’d felt Isabel’s lips whispering against her ear or her neck one more time she might have ended up doing something very unwise. And by the knowing look Song gave her when they sat down for the meal, they had not gone entirely unseen after all. Angharad was in too good a mood to feel all that chided, which seemed to amuse the Tianxi.

She was careful not to pay too much attention while the trick she had agreed on with Isabel unfolded, the maids with their full plates offering to contribute to a joint stash of food while their lady sat smiling at them without a speck of food to show for. Augusto was the first to offer his meal, Remund looking like he was about to curse when his older brother beat him to it. Isabel offered to take only half from each, ever the peacemaker, and the pair spent more time glaring at each other than noticing anything else. Master Cozme caught her eye, cocking an eyebrow at her, and she shrugged innocently.

The man chuckled, stroking his moustache, and tipped what would have been his hat at her.

Angharad smiled back but kept her attention on the arrangements for the food. There was precious little bargaining, the two maids aware they were being welcomed into the pact from a position of weakness, and it was elected that Song would see to the rationing itself. It was to begin with supper and end with arrival at the second trial. The maids remained close to them as they ate, the most Angharad had seen of them since the journey began, and it became clear that in Isabel’s absence the two did not bother to hide their common dislike. Briceida, the well-mannered redhead, kept fiddling with a small ivory trinket: it was a needle with a sculpted head, too large for sewing and so likely meant for keeping hair in place.

“It is quite pretty,” Brun complimented. “A gift from your family?”

“From poor old Gascon, in truth,” Briceida replied, preening at the compliment. “He won it gambling during our first night on the island and gave it to me the following day.”

“How kind of him,” Beatris drily said. “Entirely unprompted, I’m sure.”

A poisonous glare was turned on her.

“We cannot all earn precious stones from rats, I suppose,” Briceida smilingly replied. “Whatever did you do for it, dear Beatris? I can only hope you weren’t taken advantage of.”

“Going through my affairs again, I see,” Beatris coldly replied. “And to think I am the one from the Murk.”

Angharad cleared her throat, interrupting them before the bickering could get out of hand.

“A lovely needle indeed,” she said. “Do you intend to use it with your hair, Briceida?”

The maids sheathed their claws when the conversation turned, Brun offering her a grateful look for the intervention. The rest of the meal was spent on idle conversation, and before long they were on the march again. Tempting as it was to try to sneak another moment with Isabel in the dark, Angharad resisted the urge to try and walked with Song near the middle of their column instead. Before they could even begin to converse the entire company ground to a halt when Master Cozme let out a shout from the front.

“Everyone down,” the old soldier hissed. “Boy, close the lantern.”

The fear in his voice killed any hesitation there might have been at following the order: Angharad flattened herself against the bottom of the High Road while Brun, who had been in front with Cozme, closed the lantern’s shutter. All Angharad glimpsed before lying down against the stone was a tall silhouette striding across the plains in the distance, some feathered creature. For what might have been the better part of an hour they stayed there, only Cozme raising his head over the edge to look, and finally the old soldier told them to get up after it was gone.

“What was that thing?” Remund Cerdan asked.

“A gravebird, my lord,” Cozme Aflor darkly replied. “We do not want to ever draw one’s attention.”

All the Sacromontans looked shaken at the name, and Song as well, leaving Angharad the outsider. She had never heard of such a spirit. They resumed the journey in a strange mood, Augusto Cerdan’s too-loud boasts to Isabel that he would have protected her from the lemure ringing unpleasantly. The elder brother was more careful with his words than the younger, but not so much as to be called careful without the comparison. Remembering what he had said about chopping blocks that very morning, Angharad flushed with embarrassment. The insult had not been implicit in the slightest, only not spoken to Song directly.

“I apologize for Lord Augusto’s lack of manners this morning,” she quietly told the Tianxi. “There was no call for him to imply you have such bloody intentions, no matter the politics of the Republics.”

“I’m sure no end of little nobles are tucked in at night to tales of Republicans coming to chop off their heads if they’ve been bad,” Song amusedly said, “but I assure you the stories are exaggerated. It is only in the southernmost three republics, the Sanxing, that nobles were all sent to the block.”

Angharad started in surprise.

“I was taught that there are no nobles in Tianxia,” she slowly said. “Was this wrong?”

“There are no titles, certainly,” Song replied. “But the northern republics came late to the fold, and some less eagerly than others. Many nobles there were granted high positions in the bureaucracy after laying down their old rights. Their families remain rich and influential to this day.”

“That is not nobility,” Angharad told her, not unkindly. “It is corruption.”

For some reason the Tianxi looked very amused.

“They still have to take the examinations,” she said. “Those unsuitable to serve are weeded out, worry not. It is a compromise only Yellow Earth purists take issue with.”

These Angharad had heard of. Tianxi radicals hatching conspiracies all over Vesper, assassins and fomenters of rebellion. That the Republics might not endorse their actions but equally refused to denounce them was one of the reasons Tianxia was so often at war with its neighbours. The Pereduri often found it hard to reconcile how a people so sensible over other matters could be so senseless in this one.

“There is no need to look so troubled, Angharad,” Song teased. “I only speak of this to make it plain that firebrand hatred is not common. I even studied the Malani classics, I’ll have you know.”

“The Great Tales?” Angharad said, impressed. “I must confess I have only read Ships of Morn and The Madness of King Issay.”

It was tradition that written Umoya be learned through the Great Tales, even if the language was dated. She had despised it so much as a child that Father had only made her read the two most exciting of the tales, the ones full of battles and rebellions and gory ends. If Song had read all nine of the works, it was a worthy achievement.

“Were they translated into Antigua or Cathayan?” she asked.

“In the original Umoya,” Song replied flawlessly in that very language.

“How rare,” Angharad enthused in the same. “I only ever learned Antigua and some Gwynt myself.”

The ancient Pereduri language was considered uncouth to speak in Malani society, and only solely used by commoners deep in the duchy’s countryside.

“I’ve always wanted to learn Gwynt,” Song admitted. “There are all these lovely-sounding songs from before Morn’s Arrival that your people put to writing. My mother would not hear of it, though, kept me on Centzon and Samratrava.”

The two most common tongues of, respectively, the Kingdom of Izcalli and the Imperial Someshwar. Angharad did not stare but it was a close thing.

“Song,” she delicately said, “may I ask how many languages you do speak?”

“Seven fluently,” the Tianxi replied.

“Were you to be an interpreter, by any chance?” Angharad tried.

The other womna’s face turned serious.

“I had an unusual upbringing,” Song admitted. “But we have strayed far enough from our thread, I would think. If you did not take to the Great Works, may I ask what you did enjoy?”

The subject change was gentle, but no less firm for it. The noblewoman would not be so discourteous as to ignore it.

“I am fond of poetry,” Angharad said. “Some Lierganen greats – Ilaria and Alifonso in particular – but firstly the Malani luminaries. Ybanathi is my favourite.”

She only realized what she had said after it was too late to bite down on the words. Quietly mortified, Angharad snuck a sideways look at Song. Perhaps the Tianxi was unaware that the poetess Ybanathi was famous for her verses about her pining affections for women. Or that, in some circles, asking another woman if she had read Ybanathi was considered an indirect way to ask if she too had an interest in the fairer sex. Song smiled at her.

“Oh, I have never heard of Ybanathi before,” she said. “What did she write?”

“Several books of poems,” Angharad vaguely replied. “They defy easy description.”

“I must see to acquiring them after the trials, then,” the silver-eyed woman decided. “Perhaps you can explain them to me.”

The mortification piled on and still the Tianxi offered her that innocent smile, unknowingly twisting the knife. Although, Angharad thought as she narrowed her eyes, that smile might be a little too innocent.

“You are making sport of me,” she accused.

“Oh, distant firmament, break my back!” Song theatrically recited, hand over her heart. “It would be kinder than your frown.”

She had not thought to hear the Ode to Isore recited to her here, much less in perfect Umoya. It was more embarrassing than she might have dreamed of.

“This is most unwarranted,” Angharad plaintively said.

“I will spare you this once,” Song allowed. “But only if you formally renounce the belief you might have ever been subtle about your preferences.”

“I hid nothing, but neither did I trumpet it about,” she protested.

“It might have been more akin to a drum,” Song conceded. “Not at the forefront, yet effectively impossible to miss.”

The obvious amusement on the other woman’s face was contagious, for all that Angharad was being the figure of fun. It was meant with such an obvious lack of bile that her own lips could not help but twitch.

“I will have you know that-”

“Someone ahead,” Brun suddenly announced.

The change that came over their company was instant: weapons were eye in the blink of an eye, Angharad’s own saber leaving the sheath, and all eyes went forward as the infanzones let better fighters pass them. Only there was nothing but darkness ahead, even in the light of the lantern Cozme was now hoisting up.

“This is no laughing matter, boy,” Master Cozme harshly said. “If you think-”

I can sense the living, Brun had told her. People best, hollows and beasts with more difficulty.

“I believe him,” Angharad cut in, coming forward.

She gently pressed aside Isabel, then brushed past Augusto to join the two at the front. Her eyes went to Brun, whose face was calm but eyes had grown cold. He was preparing for a fight.

“How many?” she asked him.

“Either one or two,” he murmured. “Hollows, so it’s hard to tell.”

He leaned in closer.

“I cannot distinguish height,” Brun whispered in her ear. “They could be below. Maybe four, five hundred feet ahead.”

She grimaced, nodding her understanding. Cozme’s eyes moved between the two of them, narrowed, and the man was not a fool. He no longer asked questions or doubted Brun’s word, drawing his sword with the hand not already holding his pistol.

“Should we kill the lantern?” she asked him.

He shook his head.

“No point, hollows see better than us in the dark,” Master Cozme said. “Hard to take them by surprise. On a narrow road like this, our best bet is rushing in.”

She nodded in agreement.

“Then we need a vanguard,” Angharad said. “I volunteer.”

The veteran smiled roguishly.

“As expected,” he said. “I’ll go with you.”

He glanced back.

“Pistols and muskets out,” Cozme Aflor ordered. “Take a shot if you have a clear one, but otherwise hold your fire.”

Tension thrummed across her skin when they moved to the front, limbering limbs. With Brun’s help they might take the enemy by surprise, his contract peering ahead better than sight, but she would not bet on it. Lanterns could be seen from far away in an island without much light. She shared a nod with Cozme, then began moving. Long strides at first, then quickening into a run and rushing headfirst into as quickly as they could. Brun was holding the lantern behind them, casting is glow ahead, but Angharad still missed the signs. She thought it a curve in the stone until the dusty grey cloak nestled against the left edge of the aqueduct was thrown off, a tattooed pale man unloading his crossbow right at Cozme.

She struck out in an arc sweeping upwards and-

(Cozme ducked, the bolt tearing through his cheek, her strike was too early)

-slowed her blow, catching the bolt’s head and sending it skittering up while Cozme ducked with a shout. A heartbeat later he unloaded his pistol at the hollow as the man tried to get up, the ball hitting metal under a hair shirt and knocking the man back down. Angharad rushed forward, eyes sweeping the High Road for any trace of the second, but she found nothing. Only stone and – shit, Angharad thought, eyes straying to the side as she saw a slender silhouette running away in the plains below. They were near an arc in the aqueduct, the other darkling must have been hiding under it.

“Someone shoot-” she called out, only for a sharp crack to interrupt her.

The back of the runner’s head burst red, Song’s impeccable aim claiming another life. Good, she fiercely thought. The coward would not be able to send for reinforcements. The hollow up on the aqueduct began to rise again but she was on him and smashed her boot into his chin, putting him down, then hacked at the hand bringing up a curved blade to slash at her. There was a scream of pain as her steel bit deep as bone, the hollow’s sword clattering on the ground, and she laid a boot on his chest to keep him on the ground. Cozme was by her side a moment later, smashing the pommel of his sword in the hollow’s face. The unsettlingly pale man, who she now saw was not tattooed but ritually scarred, fell in a daze.

“You want a prisoner?” Cozme asked.

Angharad hesitated. There was no reason for the hollow to talk save if they promised to set him free, which she could not risk, or through torture, which she would not countenance. The matter was settled when a thrown hatchet sunk between the hollow’s eyes with a whooping wet sound, right into the skull. Death was near instant, Brun sliding past her as she stood struck with surprise to wrench free his weapon. He met her stare head on.

“Too dangerous to live,” the fair-haired Sacromontan simply said.

There was, though, something like satisfaction in his eyes. Had Isabel seen the truth of it, was the dark affecting him? Angharad studied the lay of his shoulders, how they seemed to loosen, and decided that not. He had been restless because darkness was not an enemy he could fight, but now that he’d fought – however short the fight – he had bled out some of the unease. It sat ill with Angharad that the hollow had been killed without a weapon in hand, but this was a battle and not a duel. Honour had not been breached.

“You are not wrong,” she finally said, and that was the end of that.

The rest of the company caught up and some few moments investigating found where the hollows had been camped. Up on the High Road there had been nothing but a waterskin – gratefully added to their reserves – under the large grey cloak, but below the arch was a pair of bedrolls and what looked like stripes of dried meat along a basket of black tomatoes. Song found how the hollow had climbed up, a knotted rope ending in hooks that had been hidden along the curve of the arch. Its existence led to heated debate, Brun and the Cerdan arguing someone should climb down and seize the supplies.

“There are two fresh corpses about and we are deep in the island,” Song flatly replied. “Every breath we waste here is a danger.”

Angharad found it distasteful to take from the dead, even though within certain bounds it was no taint on honour, so she was inclined to agree. As did Isabel, who wanted to leave this place as swiftly as possible. The argument might have gone on for longer had Beatris not suddenly let out a startled cry. Angharad reached for her blade again, following the maid’s gaze, and found a slice of darkness blotting out distant stars.

“Harrowhawk,” Song shouted.

It would take more than a blade to kill this, Angharad realized, for as the beat of great wings became deafening she saw that the descending shape was tall as three men. Master Cozme dropped the lantern, hurriedly cramming powder and shot down his pistol, and in that toppled trembling light the Pereduri saw a storm of oily feathers. Talons thicker than her legs tore into the hollow’s corpse, ripping it apart like wet paper, and in eerie silence the spirit unfolded its wings. It is a man, Angharad thought incredulously. Within the black feathers lay a silhouette of tarnished gold, arms and legs outlined in golden wire as they led up to a helmeted head.

But the arms thickened, twisted, turning into golden feathers where there should have been hands. The entire man shivered, and only then did she realize it was nothing but colour on feathers – colours that seemed too deep to truly be that.

Angharad only realized she had gone still, that all sound had fled her ears, when Brun barrelled into her.

They both fell on the hard stone, the Sacromontan hastily getting out an apology as they rose to their feet. Behind them Song snapped off a shot right in the eyes of the golden helm, but though feathers gave the spirit cared not. While Angharad had been entranced Cozme had been thrown down, wounded in a way that left a black scar on his face, and Augusto was dragging him off while screaming as the top of his lungs. Why? The creature barely even moved, only watching them as it nonchalantly tore at the hollow’s corpse.

“It’s too old for lead,” Song cursed. “We need to run.”

From a spirit that could fly? It would be pointless. They could only fight. Breathing out, Angharad pushed down her fear and turned to face the golden frame. Distance would be hard to measure, with so little light, but it was not so different from shadow-fighting. She could do this, the Pereduri told herself, and rushed forward. Someone behind shouted her name, but she could not find it in herself to care. It felt… distant.

“YOU ARE HOME.”

“Mother?” she whispered, stumbling forward.

“YES. COME TO ME. YOU ARE HOME.”

Had it, had it all been a dream? The fire and the screams and the people hounding her to the ends of the earth. She took a step forward, back slick with sweat.

“YOU ARE SAFE,” Mother sang to her. “YOU ARE HOME. YOU ARE MINE.”

She could feel the warmth of the hearth, her mother’s embrace. Only even as took another step, she felt it slip through her fingers. The warmth was leaving, cold running through her veins. The coolness of water in the dark, in a deep place that only silence knew. And a voice spoke through her, though it was not a voice: it was the tide eating away the cliffside, the cry of gulls picking at corpses, the sound of men kneeling. It was the patient crawl of the inexorable.

“Know your place,” the Fisher chided.

Angharad came back to herself as the golden stingers that’d been closing around her face like grotesque fingers tore away, the spirit screeching in pain as it tried to cover its head with its wings. She hacked at the body, blade sliding into the feathers as if they were made of oil, and withdrew her dripping saber with a shiver of disgust. There was nothing she could do, she realized, and so she fled. Whatever it was her patron had done to the spirit, it was soon gone and she’d barely taken three steps before its wings unfolded again.

“Briceida,” Isabel said in a trembling voice. “Do it.”

“My lady-”

“Do it.”

And Angharad saw as the redheaded maid took a step forward, ashen-faced and turned her eyes on the spirit looming over them all.

She clapped her hands.

The terrifying ring of it threw the noblewoman down against the stone, as if a ship had smashed into a cliff right above her head. Her cheek against the aqueduct, dirt and blood in her mouth, Angharad crawled forward. Behind her, the spirit – the harrowhawk – was rippling like a pond in the wind. All save for the silhouette of gold painted on its feathers.

“Again,” Isabel commanded, tone grown firmer.

Briceida clapped her hands and wind blew against Angharad’s braids, the spirit screeching behind her. The Pereduri rose to her feet and out of the way, Brun helping her up. She turned just in time to see the harrowhawk rip in two the hollow’s corpse, screeching in hatred at them, but flinching away when the redheaded maid drew back her hands. A least scream of hate and the spirit leapt off the edge of the aqueduct, great wings spreading, and fled into the night.

“Are you all right?” Brun gently asked her.

“Fine,” she got out. “I was… protected.”

She could no longer feel the Fisher’s presence. The old spirit would have let her die, she knew, if it had been claws or fang that were to take her. But the harrowhawk had tried to take her soul, and that the Fisher had not been willing to countenance.

He had a claim to it, until their bargain was done.

“And a good thing that you were,” Song bit out, looking her over from head to toe like a fretting mother. “Harrowhawks eat the souls they take, Angahrad, but slowly. It is decades of screaming torment.”

“Then I must give Briceida my thanks twice over,” she replied, turning to find the handmaid.

She was currently kneeling on the floor, Isabel standing over her and soothing her back as the redhead desperately ate what looked like a white powdery tablet. Aside from Cozme’s face wound and the way Augusto Cerdan was cradling his left arm, their company seemed to have made it out unharmed. They would not have, Angharad thought, had the creature been more interested in eating their bodies than their souls. Pushing down the grim thought, she returned her gaze to the strange spectacle of Briceida.

“A Sacromontan remedy?” she ventured.

Lierganen medicine still hewed too close to the practices of the Second Empire, all knew, and so their doctors were hardly better than the plague.

“No,” Brun quietly replied, eyes hooded. “That’s chalk. Tablets of chalk.”

His parents had been miners, Angharad recalled. None of them further commented on Briceida crunching down on an entire tablet the length long as the beginning of the noblewoman’s wrist to the tip of her fingers. If it was not medicine then it was a contract’s price, and not something to be discussed when the handmaid had just saved all their lives. The redhead was half-weeping, Isabel gently holding her as she finished the last of the chalk and began retching.

“Another,” Briceida rasped. “Fuck, he wants another.”

She was noisily sick a heartbeat later and they all looked away. In the songs, in the stories, spirits asked beautiful things of those they made bargains with: a song of true love, the beat of a butterfly’s wings, a blade quenched in devil’s blood. But those were songs, and truth was not so pretty. Sometimes spirits wanted baser things as payment, like the sensation of a woman eating chalk no matter what the eating did to her body. At Brun’s quiet suggestion they spent went to pull up the rope the hollows had used to climb the aqueduct. After the harrowhawk’s visit, there was no more talk of lingering there: it might yet come back, or a more dangerous spirit grow curious of the racket.

Briceida had to eat most of a second tablet, but that one at least she kept down. They moved out the moment she could stand, Angharad putting away the rope in her bag without a word.

They fled forward into the dark, only a shivering lantern light guiding them.

# Chapter 15

It had already been a difficult day, so naturally it began raining.

Only a patter at first, nothing like the sheets of icy water Peredur’s coasts enjoyed springing on its dwellers, but it grew. Within an hour they could hardly see in front of the even with the lantern, stumbling along carefully. Master Cozme pointed out a silver lining, that few lemures could fly in such weather and none could follow a scent through it, but wet feet spoke louder than his optimism. It did not stop there: Angharad had near forgot that the High Road was an aqueduct, after using it for a highway so long, but now she was up to her ankles in the reminder. The rain had filled the aqueduct’s body up to their ankles and were it not so rich with broken edges the water would have run even higher.

Between wading against the current on now treacherous footing, all of them being soaked to the bone through their clothes and the wind beginning to hurl itself at them from the east – cold, it felt as if none of them were wearing coats – the mood took a grim turn.

It did not help that not all were recovered from the encounter with the harrowhawk. Angharad was yet dazed, prone to staring out into the storm, and though Cozme had cleaned out the wound he’d taken on his face the flesh was still dark. They were both better off than Augusto Cerdan, whose left arm was broken, and better still than poor Briceida. The handmaid had been sick since eating her chalk tablets, enough that the wind and rain slowed her advance to a crawl. Brun was helping her keep pace, but the two were at the back of the company and certain to stay there. Angharad made sure to pull back and stay with them a span whenever they trailed behind too much.

She caught an irritated expression on Brun’s face once or twice, but she would tell him later no insult was meant to his efforts. It was only that if they lost the pair in the storm, there was no telling when the two would be able to catch up. Better to slow their entire company than to risk it.

They all felt the change in the current around two hours before dinner, the way it was now pulling forward instead of back. It was good news, Angharad was informed as a few of them pulled close together and shouted over the rainstorm’s din to understand each other. It meant they were close to a break in the aqueduct, one they had planned to reach hours ago. They had passed the great river without even realizing and by now they must be surrounded by woods. If they pushed on after dinner time, they ought to reach the end of the High Road today. Since no one was eager to sleep in a river, Angharad the notion was agreed on.

The first break in the High Road was subtle enough Beatris almost walked off the edge.

She was pulled back shrieking by Remund Cerdan, who promptly shouted for a halt. It was only a break of about five feet, though unnaturally neat: as if some giant’s sharp sword had sliced through the aqueduct. If not for the weather they might have been expected to make the jump, but as things stood Remund was prevailed upon to use his contract. First a ring for them to step on, halfway, then another above and to the side of it for them to hold on to.

“Some of you have gloves,” Song shouted into the rain. “They should be shared with whoever crosses.”

Not even the Cerdan brothers tried to argue that holding a cloth to the rings of light would be enough in such weather. Good. Angharad had not been looking forward to again pulling her sleeves forward and grasping the light through them: if she slipped even a little, she would be holding the burning radiance. She was the third to cross, using Isabel’s gloves and passing them back to a leaning Brun, and once across with her pack she followed Cozme to the edge to share in his grimace. The small break had only been the first, leading onto an elevated island ten feet long. The real precipice lay ahead: almost forty feet of mostly missing aqueduct, with some arches still standing but no funnel over them.

“It may be too dangerous to cross,” Master Cozme yelled.

The man passed a hand through his drenched hair, clearly regretting the loss of his hat. Angharad sympathized: with how much rain her braids had taken, it felt like someone had hung a waterskin against the back of her head.

“We cannot camp here,” Angharad shouted back. “There’s no other way.”

“He’ll need to be carried after,” Cozme told her. “The contract is hard on his body.”

“Then we will carry him,” the Pereduri insisted.

There was no arguing with the needs of the moment, so before long Remund Cerdan set to tracing his rings of light across the gap. It was a thing surreal, almost out of a play, to see the man hanging in the air in the middle of a storm with only slices of light to stand on, making a foothold and handhold every time. Had Angharad not been able to glimpse the clear terror on the younger Cerdan’s face, she might have thought him a spirit. Lord Remund slowed near the end, his limbs grown stiff, and only narrowly made it to the other side. He collapsed the moment he reached there, though to everyone’s relief the rings stayed. Not knowing how long that would be the case, they set to crossing in a hurry.

It was one of the most thoroughly unpleasant experiences in Angharad’s life.

The rain somehow made the solid light slippery, and with the wind whipping it in her face she could barely see the rings ahead of her. Twice she had to hold on for dear life to one of the ‘handhold’ rings as her boots slipped, fear icily seizing her limbs, and when she threw herself at the end of the road her angle was off: she fell and bruised her knees against the aqueduct’s bottom, cold water running down from her collarbones to her belly. It was a good thing she carried no blackpowder, for it would surely have been ruined. As the fourth to cross Angharad found that others had already helped Remund to sit up but also that he was no better for it.

Though he stayed out of the lantern’s light, all the skin she glimpsed had turned pale as ivory and she hardly saw him move save for breathing. The infanzon was half a statue already and there were still others yet to cross. Stomach in knots at the though of what might happen to him and the others both, Angharad stalked around the end of the ring road with nervous impatience. They had a stroke of luck when the storm began to calm, the rain growing sparser, but it would only get them so far. By the time the last of them began the crossing, Remund could only moved with a shallow breath. Not even to blink. Augusto was the last to cross, and in a way he was lucky.

The storm was near dead by now, the rain barely more than a patter and the wind more of a breeze. The Cerdan made better time than any of them all the way across – lights winking out behind him – as he made haste. On the last foothold he threw them all a cocky grin, his only good hand releasing the handhold ring before he leapt.

The wind picked up halfway through.

Angharad was standing close, still stalking about, so she saw the horror writ plain on his face. His jump fell short, brushed aside, and he hit the edge of the aqueduct with his belly. Hands scrabbled against wet, smooth stone while water flowed into his face – screams of surprise of dismay sounded behind her, but Angharad was already moving. She caught his arm as it slid back, clothes ripping but her fingers tightened around his wrist and she held tight with gritted teeth. She was kneeling in the water and, Sleeping God, she could feel her boots slip.

“Help her,” Isabel shouted.

Cozme was there a moment later, pulling at Augusto’s shoulder, and between the two of them they hoisted him over the edge. Augusto crawled through the wet, eyes wild and limbs shaking as he fled the edge of the aqueduct.

“Gods,” the infanzon croaked. “Gods.”

Catching her breath, Angharad knelt by his side and closed her eyes. Her heart was beating as wildly as his must. She might have stayed there a while, rain flowing down her face, had the infanzon not tugged at her sleeve.

“Thank you,” Augusto Cerdan said. “Lady Tredegar. I did not think you would…”

“We are under truce,” Angharad said. “Your safety is yet my concern.”

It was not the reason she had moved. In the moment, she had only seen a man about to die. Honor’s laws had only caught up to her hands after the deed. The dark-haired noble swallowed, nodding, and looked torn.

“The rings only support the weight of one man,” he said, tone somewhere between a plea and a concession. “There was no other way for us to live. The knife, it was a mercy. Better that than to be eaten alive.”

Her face hardened.

“Then we should have died,” Angharad flatly replied. “There are some lines good men do not cross.”

His cheeks were already red from the cold, but anger reddened them yet more.

“I should have known better,” Augusto Cerdan spat out. “Go on, then, Tredegar. Honour has been satisfied, you need not keep my company any longer.”

It sounded fine by her, so she stiffly took her leave. Even after that close call their company agreed to press on, for now that the storm was weak they were certain to be able to descend from the High Road that night. The original plan, Angharad learned, had been for their company to camp up on the aqueduct for safety and then descend the following morning – that method would also allow Remund, who was still unmoving as marble, to rest before using his contract again. Instead they would be using the rope taken from the hollows that Angharad was carrying so they might find shelter down in the woods away from the water. It would take hours, after all, for the aqueduct to empty even after rain ceased. None of them wanted to sleep in a filthy riverbed.

It was almost a surprise that the last leg of the journey was so uneventful, the only imposition that Remund Cerdan had to be carried by two of them at all times. He was, she noticed much heavier than a man his size should be. Angharad was careful never to touch any of that too-pale skin when it was her turn to bear the weight, afraid of what it might spread. By the time they reached the end of the High Road, or at least the part they intended to use – its silhouette resumed half a mile ahead, leading into the mountains – Remund was capable of hobbling forward. It only took one of them to help him keep up, much like Briceida.

Getting down from the aqueduct was more tedious than dangerous. Remund and Briceida were lowered tied with the rope instead of climbing down, which took most of the rest of their company to do safely, and after that down went their last supplies. They were all soaked, exhausted and irritable but by the end of it they were finally back on solid ground.

Around them were deep woods, tall trees whose branches obscured much of the sky, but the way forward was plain: they were near the bottom of a hill and going north up the slope would lead them to the mountains where the second trial awaited. There would be a need to march eastwards for a few hours, as the High Road was on the western half of the Dominion, but they should be well past the hollows and the most dangerous lemures. They still set a watch after finding a tall tree to hide under, settling in for the night and hoping their clothes would dry some before they had to march again.

Exhaustion saw to it that Angharad fell into a mercifully dreamless sleep.

—

The clothes were only half-dry, so they all stank like dogs when they set out the following morning.

The slope was muddy and slippery, covered by a thick carpet of dead leaves, but there could be no mistaking the way they needed to go. Up the hills they went, through trees and great ferns and fields of pale blue wildflowers. When the mud turned to rock Angharad knew they were close, and barely an hour after that they were looking up at the towering heights of the mountains at the heart of the Dominion of Lost Things.

“We are a little further north than I would prefer,” Song told them, consulting her map, “but following the mountains east will get us most of the way there. We will have to go around crags to find the road to the sanctuary, but I expect we will reach the end of our journey a little past midday.”

The Tianxi’s prediction ended up somewhat off, as they discovered two hours in that a landslide had cut their path east. They decided against risking to cross it when they found some great boulders balancing precariously further up, instead dipping back south into the woods and then resuming going east. Their pace was slower in the forest, noticeably so, and by the time they stopped for lunch they were barely halfway through the journey. Before long, at least, they finally found the crags that Song had mentioned: three massive rocks with flat tops, forming a broad half-circle appended to the mountainside.

“The road we must take passes behind them,” Song said, “and then rides the edge of the one closest to the mountains to lead up to the sanctuary’s entrance.”

“Would it not be possible to go through them instead?” Master Cozme asked. “Surely there are paths we could use.”

“There are, but I was advised against doing this,” the Tianxi replied. “Landslides are apparently common, especially after rain.”

“It is an unnecessary risk,” Isabel opined. “Let us take the longer way.”

Most agreed with her, including Angharad. They had barely begun circling the crags when Brun breathed in sharply. He turned to catch her eye and she drifted close, but Remund Cerdan – now recovered, unlike poor Briceida who was still lagging behind despite being able to walk on her own – raised a hand at them.

“None of that,” the infanzon said. “If your contract had told you something, share it with all our company and not only our dear Lady Tredegar.”

Angharad grimaced but nodded when Brun’s turned a questioning gaze her way. The cat was out of the bag: Master Cozme had noticed the hint of a contract before their fight with the hollows, and evidently passed on his suspicions to his lords.

“There are people to our west,” Brun said. “Hollows, I think. At least ten of them.”

They had just come from the west, moving eastwards, so their company was either being followed or about to be: most of them were poor woodsmen, any half-decent tracker would be able to find traces of their passage.

“Are they following us?” Augusto Cerdan bluntly asked.

“Too early to tell,” Brun shrugged, “but they are coming our way.”

“Then we must hurry,” Angharad said. “The last thing we need is a fight.”

She did not fear testing her blade against darklings, but their company was wounded and exhausted. Mistakes were certain to be made. They picked up the pace, no longer even half-heartedly attempting not to leave a trail, and after half an hour Brun told them the hollows had been left behind. The news cheered them all, until another quarter hour passed and he told them that another group of hollows was coming from the west.

They were, it seemed, being hunted.

“If we head south we might be able to circle around the western warband,” Isabel suggested.

“That is exactly what they want, my lady,” Cozme Aflor shook his head. “They are not going for the kill at the moment, only pushing us firther away from the sanctuary so they might hunt us at their leisure.”

“We don’t know how well they can track us,” Remund noted. “Isabel’s idea might well be feasible.”

Angharad shook her head.

“This is too much for coincidence,” she said. “How would they have known to watch near the High Road? It smacks of Gloam sorcery or a tracking contract.”

The latter were not so rare: she had been hunted through the streets of Sacromonte by what she suspected to be exactly such a thing. The darklings of the Dominion were a cult worshipping some ancient spirit, it was only to be expected that some among them would have won contracts off this ‘Red Eye’.

“She is right,” Master Cozme grunted. “It’s too close a hunt for how clever we have been. There is only one way: we need to try the crags.”

No one was eager, given the dangers Song had spoken of, but at least the landslides would not be purposefully hunting them.

“I saw what looked like a trail going up,” Brun told them.  “About half a mile back.”

“I saw it as well,” Song agreed. “It seems our best chance if we are to move quickly enough to slip the noose.”

It felt like wasted time to go back the way they’d just come, but Angharad kept silent. It was the wisest course. The trail the pair had spoken of was more of ravine just large enough for someone to squeeze through, leading towards what the lantern revealed to be an outcropping low enough to be climbable. For lack of better choices they went through, stone scraping at their sides. It was half an hour of occasionally painful squeezing and climbing – Briceida was finally feeling better, no longer slowing them down so much – until they reached a broader path.

It was another ravine inside the crag, this one about two people wide. Angharad suspected it must have been worn into existence by rain over decades, for it was narrow at the top and wider at the bottom. The ground had dried since last night, fortunately, and the footing was smooth. The occasional falling rock was a small price to pay for the good time they made but goods news, as ever, were followed with bad.

“We are being followed,” Brun told them, voice echoing against the stone. “They are taking the same path we did.”

And gaining on them, he did not need to say. They hurried but the hollows stayed on their heels and the situation was untenable. It was Augusto that offered a solution.

“Look at the edges on either side,” he said, pointing up.

Rocks was what they found, but Angharad immediately grasped what he was leading at. Their ravine, carved by water, was thinner at the top. The cliffside over them was being eaten away at by erosion, grown unstable. With the right nudge, it could collapse.

“We do not have enough powder to blow it up,” Angharad told him.

Not even if they used every powder box and pouch they had with them.

“No,” Augusto agreed, “but there is another method at hand.”

He turned to Briceida, face stern, and the handmaid flinched. The Pereduri wanted to chide the infanzon for demanding such a thing of her when only yesterday she had saved all their lives, but she bit her tongue. It would work, she was sure of it. The ravine echoed slightly when they spoke, the oppressive noise that the redhead’s contract made was certain to have great effect. And as she had said, they did not have enough powder to use instead. So instead Angharad steeled her heart and stepped forward.

“If you are too sick to walk afterwards, Briceida, I will carry you myself.”

The other woman flinched again, and Angharad bit the inside of her cheek in shame. Isabel laid a hand on her handmaid’s arm and gently smiled.

“You know I would not ask it of you if our lives were not on the line, my dear,” the infanzona said. “But they are, yours among them.”

Briceida reluctantly nodded, then turned to address Angharad.

“I will surely have need of your aid, my lady, so I must take you at your word,” she said.

“As it should be,” the Pereduri simply replied.

They waited longer before doing it, choosing a fitting place for the deed. Further ahead they found a place where the ravine narrowed to a single man’s width and the slope rose quickly ahead, which was most suitable. Angharad was tense all throughout, but after Briceida clapped her hands only a few chunks of stone fell over their heads – and their group scattered in time. The redhead had directed the sound skillfully, and past them the damage was impressive. After the initial avalanche, a heartbeat passed and there was a massive crack. An entire chunk of the cliff began sliding down, a stone larger than two horses, while all along the ravine smaller rocks fell in a thundering rain.

Briceida bit through another tablet of chalk and was noisily sick afterwards, barely able to stand, so Angharad had her climb on her back and hold tight. They did not wait until the dust had settled to begin their flight.

It was another hour of narrow ravines and waterless waterfalls before they found a way out, which to their pleasant surprise was atop the middle crag of the three. They rose to the stars above their heads and a spread of thin grass atop the stone, woods beginning ahead. That stripe of forest seemed to lead all the way to where the first crag touched the mountains, from what they could make out. There Song said that the road to the sanctuary and the shrines began. Though it had been a dangerous affair, in the end they had shaven a few hours off their journey by risking the crags. The mood lifted at the news, even Briceida managing a smile, and they resumed their march.

When they were a dozen feet away from the forests’ edge, Brun suddenly went still.

Angharad was learning to hate the sight of that.

“Hollows,” he said. “Dozens of them, waiting in ambush.”

Master Cozme loudly cursed. Angharad wished manners allowed her to do the same, for she fully shared the sentiment. The cult of the Red Eye had been one step ahead of them again.

“How far ahead?” Song asked.

“Hard to tell,” Brun admitted. “There’s something off about the warband, like it is not truly there. I think the Gloam might be clouding my contract.”

“So it could be false, an illusion?” Augusto Cerdan pressed.

“Wishful thinking,” Angharad cut in. “We must treat them as real.”

The ensuing argument was quiet but heated, their company eventually owning up to the truth that there was no way out but through. Going eastwards on the other crag had no guarantee to yield a path down, and even if it did there was no guarantee the hollows would not follow them there – or even wait at the end of the path, at the bottom of the climb towards sanctuary. The trouble was that not all of their group was fit to fight, or even run for long, so a ruse need be employed.

“One group to draw attention, another to sneak through,” Master Cozme suggested.

It was a plain strategy, but they were not well-oiled enough a crew to attempt anything complicated anyhow. Simply putting all the fighters in the distraction group was a recipe for slaughter if the other group was caught, so the division was not so clean. Isabel, Briceida – helped to walk by Beatris – Song and Augusto would be the crew meant to sneak around. Cozme, Angharad, Brun and Remund were to draw the enemy into a running fight. With Brun’s contract they should have the advantage of surprise, allowing them to strike first and true before running past the enemy.

The ensuing chase and confusion would allow the others to get past the enemy, or such was the hope.

Much as Angharad might have wished otherwise, there was no time for long goodbyes. The longer they waited to move the greater the risk the ambushing cultists would tire of waiting and try to catch them out in the open instead. She squeezed Isabel’s hands tenderly when the infanzona came to kiss her cheeks, then shook Song’s hand. The last three received a nod, friendlier for some than others, and she set out into the woods behind Master Cozme. With Brun serving as their eyes, they chose their angle of approach – along the eastern ridge of the crag, flanking the hollows – and slowly advanced, careful not to make any noise.

For nearly half an hour they moved as silently as they could, nerves rising, until they were in place. Angharad could see most of the warband from behind the bush she used a hiding place, maybe twenty darklings mostly bearing spears and swords. There were a pair of crossbowmen as well, standing near an old hollow in robes. A priest of some kind? The old one, who the others seemed to defer to, was talking to people who she could not see – the sight was blocked by a fallen tree – in what sounded like Antigua. The cultists wore padded cloth as armour, save for a few elites, but were all fighting fit and many scarred from war.

“Careful with the crossbowmen,” Cozme murmured. “Try to keep trees in the way and kill warriors wearing padding first. The armoured will tire first when chasing.”

They shared nods, fists tightening around their weapons, and took the deep breath before the plunge.

Then the Sleeping God turned in his slumber, undoing all their plans.

It happened in moments: a band of half a dozen warriors, most armored with breastplates or mail, were talking with someone up a tree and the answer they got had them laughing. They spread out, slapping or jostling a few of the other warriors, and in moments they were all up. Heading southwest, where the other group should be beginning to move. Cozme swallowed a curse and they all hesitated. Their only chance against such numbers had been surprise but now the warriors were up and alert. It would be a slaughter and not one in their favour. Yet they could not abandon the others, Angharad would not allow it.

“We hit them from behind when they begin to attack,” she murmured.

Augusto nodded in approval, then Cozme. Brun grimaced then agreed as well. They set out, slowly, and that was when Angharad saw her: that Asphodel noble from the Bluebell, the one with the acne scars. She had just leapt down from the tree, joining another. One by one Angharad saw them. Leander Galatas, still without his arm but no longer looking so gaunt. The large Aztlan called Ocotlan, his hammer hefted over his shoulder. And last of all the leader of their pack of jackals, Tupoc Xical himself. He asked something of the Asphodelian woman, Lady Acanthe, and she pointed to the southwest.

The hollows followed her directions without a single voice speaking otherwise.

“Tracker,” Angharad said through gritted teeth.

But one who could not find their group. Their enemies would pay for that. Creeping behind the warband, who were so certain of the Asphodelian’s contract did not bother with a proper rearguard, they waited until they could see the hollows spreading out for an ambush. When Song carefully slipped out from behind the shadow of a tree, eyes scanning the woods, the warriors at the fore raised their spears and finally Master Cozme signalled for their group to attack. They burst out of the brush, none of them announcing their arrival with war cries, and just as Song’s eyes widened at the sight of them Cozme Aflor shot the first hollow from behind.

Madness seized them all.

Angharad felt a crossbow bolt whiz past her head as she hewed open a man’s head, slapping aside another’s spear and plunging her blade through his open mouth. She ripped it clear, teeth flying and saw that powder smoke was obscuring the melee. She glimpsed Ocotlan kicking down Remund Cerdan, only to be driven back by Cozme, and then through the drifting smoke she saw Song being surrounded by hollows. Angharad rushed there, ducking under someone’s blind strike in the smoke and cutting at what felt like cloth. Song was cornered, having cut a hollow with her blade but now being stuck holding back another’s blade, so Angharad struck with worried fury.

They were fighters, these darklings, but their training was lacking.

She let the first overcommit to her lunge, tripped her as she stepped back and slit her throat on the way down. The hollow behind her screamed, attacking in rage with a two-handed sword, but he was slow. Strength only mattered if it could reach you. She plunged the point of her saber in his throat, wrenching it out and stepping to the side so he might die finishing to strike at air. The third hit Song’s knee, forcing her down with a pained grunt as the sword she was holing back dipped towards her throat, so Angharad clicked her tongue and pivoted to adjust her angle to eviscerate the fourth hollow.

The silver-eyed Tianxi let out a snarl of triumph, pushing up and punching the last hollow in the throat before running him through. Angharad began to check her for wounds, then had to duck behind a tree when she heard the whistle of an arrow. Song followed her there.

“We need to run,” the Tianxi said. “Grab everyone we can and flee.”

Angharad nodded.

“Briceida first,” she said. “She will need help.”

Song nodded and the two burst from cover, Angharad avoiding the spear-point of some fat darkling in mail and kicking him in the stomach. Briceida was only a dozen feet away from them and she had been struck down, but she was not dead: instead a hollow had blackened her eyes and was now standing over her half-conscious form. They want prisoners, Angharad realized with horror. She fell upon the hollow that stood over the redheaded maid, but before she could do more than bat aside his sword she heard movement behind her. She smoothly pivoted and struck at torso height, but Tupoc took the blow with the side of his metal segmented spear. He then whipped at her belly with the bottom of the haft, forcing her to backpedal. Behind them Song clashed blades with the hollow, covering Angharad’s back.

The Aztlan, she realized, was humming some kind of song. Something light and cheerful, as if this were a festival instead of a battlefield.

“You will die for this,” Angharad swore.

“I admire your confidence,” Tupoc told her.

Worse, he sounded like he meant it. She went after him furiously, but he was not like the cultist: whoever had trained him, they had done a good work of it. He never stopped moving, forcing her to circle and weave by constantly changing the distance: he used his spear as much as a quarterstaff as thrusting weapon. Song finished her opponent and woke Briceida, but the redhead could barely move even when helped up. Worse, they’d drawn attention. More were coming and when a crossbow bolt hit the tree an inch away from her head Song drew back.

“Run,” the Tianxi said. “The others are, it is lost-”

Angharad snarled, catching a blow from the side of Tupoc’s spear and then using her favorite flatfoot trick – half a step back, let it slide down the length and pivot as you hit out with the pommel. Her saber’s pommel caught the Aztlan in the jaw, her first solid hit, and he rocked back. Bloodied, at last. The Pereduri moved towards Briceida but there was already a cultist on the redhead, grabbing her by the hair, and she was tossed down on the floor. Angharad struck at the man’s back furiously, but it was not enough.

“No,” redhead wept. “No, you won’t take me.”

The world breathed in, and then Briceida let out a scream like the clap of thunder.

Ringing silence filled her ears and something blew Angharad off her feet. She fell against a tree, knocking her shoulder badly. Her vision swam as she gasped, trying to rise, only to feel someone dragging her up. Sound began to return, but dimmed.

“Quick,” Isabel hissed. “Hurry, while they are confused.”

Angharad stumbled forward as best she could, half-blind. Two hands steadied her, Isabel on one side and Master Cozme the other. But they were not alone: Remund was with them, face bruised and lips bloodied. Behind them shouts began, the hollows beginning to recover from Briceida’s scream.

“The others,” Angharad mumbled.

“They ran also,” Remund said. “The hollows did not come to kill: they wanted sacrificed, an only took one.”

The pride in his voice sickened her. Briceida, oh Sleeping God. She was still alive, and now the cultists had her. But what could Angharad to, save continuing to run? The daze was passing, but she was no match for the warband now pursuing them. All she could do was run like a coward with the rest of their company. Only it could not be so easy. How long they ran in the dark Angharad was not sure, but eventually they stopped: the rest were ahead of them, hiding behind a tall stone, and Song gestured fervently for them to stop. Angharad fell against a tree, hearing Master Cozme peek around and breathe in sharply.

“There’s a clearing ahead,” he said. “And a pair of watchers. If we don’t kill them before they scream for the others we are all dead.”

“Where are we?” Angharad murmured.

“Near the edge of the crag,” Isabel replied just as quietly. “If we get past them, running northeast will be a straight line to the sanctuary road. We need only-”

She was interrupted by a shout behind them. The Pereduri tensed for half a heartbeat before realizing they had not been seen. Not yet. But the cultists they had left behind had found their trail, were catching up to them. If they did not move soon, then they were just as dead as in Cozme’s prediction.

“We’ll have to shoot them,” Angharad said. “All we can do is run.”

“Agreed,” Master Cozme grunted, though he did not sound happy about it.

Neither was she. The sound would draw the other cultists to them. The older man was already pouring powder down his pistol’s muzzle, peeking out past the tree trunk to gauge the distance to the pair of watchers. The best shot of their company was Song, so Angharad half-rose to try and catch her attention. Between she and Cozme, their odds were good of killing both watchers in one volley. Only when Angharad turned her gaze there, it was another who had a gun in hand: Augusto, his sole good arm steady and his face cold, aimed his pistol. Only it was not at the hollows. Behind him Brun turned, surprise on his face, but he was too late.

Augusto Cerdan met Angharad’s eyes and pulled the trigger.

# Chapter 16



Angharad flinched, but she did not die.

No, the ball hit the tree about a foot to the right of her head. Bark went flying and a heartbeat later both cultists keeping watch turned her way – she felt Cozme going still as he was caught leaning out of cover.

The cultists shouted, and just like that the traitor had killed them.

There should have been a burst of movement, of surprise and fear and hatred, but instead Angharad breathed deep. The urgency bled out of her, slowly but surely, as a great silence spread. Stillness hung in the air, like the world had been seized by the throat.

The fishing line struck the scene before her and the impact rippled out, as if writ on water.

Angharad Tredegar stood stranded on an island’s shore, stones digging into the soles of her boots. She looked down at herself, seeing on the water the moment where time had gone still: at once she knew she still stood there, in that other place, but also that so long as she stood on this forlorn shore it was nothing but a reflection on shadowy waters. The ripples calmed, showing again the crystallized act of Augusto Cerdan’s betrayal in perfect detail.  Without turning or daring to move an inch, Angharad knew that there was something besides her. An entity great and terrible, so much that her mind trembled at the very thought of beholding it.

The Fisher’s steady breath was as a gust of wind, the spirit patiently fishing in the moment-become-water.

“He betrayed me,” Angharad finally said. “I knew he would, but to think he would go so far? Master Cozme and his brother, even Isabel.”

She ground her teeth, seething with impotent anger.

“He is a man without honour,” she bit out.

Above them there was only darkness, as if they stood under an eternity of nothing, but Angharad somehow knew there was a ceiling. This was a cavern, resounding with the quiet echo of water lapping at the shore of the island within it. Where the spirit she had struck a pact with still waited, his patience as absolute a truth as the coming of the tide.

“Honour,” the Fisher said, slowly speaking the word as if feeling it out.

The fishing line struck at water, ripples turning the moment into a confusion of colour and lines, and the spirit hummed.

“A worthless thing.”

She rocked back as if he’d struck her across the face. Anger and surprise fought fear for the barest of heartbeats, long enough she looked at the spirit. A hulking shape towering above her, more fortress than man, and in the dark she could make little more than a silhouette. But she saw the trails of ichor, the rivulets of black on grey skin that bled down from the crown of his head. They dripped down the Fisher’s body all the way to the stones beneath his feet, staining them black. There was a basket on the other side of him, tall as she and full of wriggling things.

Instinct screamed at her not to look at it too closely.

“It is not,” she sharply replied. “It is priceless.”

The Fisher shook his head, chiding.

“Its price is known to all, Angharad Tredegar.”

His voice was not a man’s voice, with emotion and cadence and all the shades of humanity. It was a spirit’s, as much the glimpse of something she could barely comprehend as a sound. Her mind told her she heard the sound of the sea against stone, of bones shattering like twigs, but she could not have explained why. Against her will, Angharad wrenched her gaze away. She was trembling, slick with sweat. The spirit was not meant to be beholden by mortal eyes.

“Why were you betrayed, child?”

“Fear,” she said. “Fear and jealousy.”

The spirit laughed. It was a sound utterly without joy: a wound ripping open, a friend abandoned in the dark.

“Because you are weak,” the Fisher corrected.

“I am not weak,” Angharad hissed. “I have earned ten stripes, spirit, and won against-”

“The victories of a child,” he dismissed. “You fight a woman’s battles, now, yet still hold them up as trophies. Why should they not betray you? It is nothing more than what you deserve.”

“We had a truce,” she shouted. “He turned not only on me but on his brother, on Cozme and Isabel. How can you claim I am at fault?”

“Truce,” the spirit repeated, amused. “Another word. How many will you hide behind?”

“Keeping your promises is the foundation of the world,” Angharad bit back. “Of everything we are.”

“There is only one foundation to the world, child,” the Fisher said, with a certainty like iron and stone, like tide and decay. “The eldest law, whose name is extinction.”

And now she understood, for she had learned at her father’s knee as much as her mother’s. The old songs, the old tales, the old ways. She had come here in the dark, on the eve of death, and the spirit she had bargained with was testing her. Angharad swore she would not prove unworthy.

“That is despair, spirit,” she said. “I refuse it. It will not own me.”

And she meant it, for all that she had a role to play. Angharad was not without fault, and sometimes she bent honour or twisted it, but she would never renounce it. It there was failure, it was hers and not that of what she aspired to. Even if she fell short all her life, why should she cease trying? The final betrayal of what you were was to surrender to the tide of the world, to let it decide who you were to be.

“Perhaps it is not writ in the bone of Vesper that honour should matter,” Angharad admitted. “But it can be made to – and I will fight to make it so.”

She readied herself for pain or anger, for the test of her resolve, but the spirit only flicked his fishing rod. Lights swirled, and below the waters she glimpsed shapes moving.

“And so you are betrayed,” the Fisher said. “You claim rights you have not won, acting as if your desires are born worthy of respect.”

“Why do you still exist, Fisher, if the eldest law is absolute?” she challenged.

“It can be stalled,” the spirit said. “That, too, is true. But only strength can achieve this, and you are weak. Your will is dull. Your enemies defy you with impunity.”

Shapes circled around the bait under the surface, as above lights scattered like a broken mosaic.

“Laws,” the Fisher told her, “are the right of the strong and them alone. Your honour is not a law, it is a noose.”

Her heart clenched with fear. This… it did not feel like a test of her mettle. There was no fearsome wrath, no pain or fear or battle of tricks. The Fisher did not seem interested enough in her for this, and that more than anything else had a gaping pit opening in her stomach. Was this only a remonstration before her death, some kind of sick sermon from the ancient spirit? No, she told herself. Doubt is how victory slips away. It must be a test, it must.

“I do not believe that,” Angharad replied, looking down at the waters.

She clenched her fists, knowing that as soon as the ripples settled she would once more see Augusto Cerdan betraying his kin and professed love for a better chance at running away. The Fisher was not wrong, that the infanzon had done it because he feared her not. Because he thought he would get away with it, that even if she survived she would be bound by oaths not to slay him for his treachery. All of this might never have happened, if she had simply let him fall last night. But that was not the whole of it, was it?

If you began to act in only the ways that helped you, if you cared nothing for duty and dues, then you were as an animal. And that sickness, it spread until there was no law but the law of the sword and the whole world was as a butcher’s yard. There was a cost to peace, to plenty and safety and Vesper being more than packs of wolves tearing each other to bits: sometimes, you had to lose. To accept that you could not win every time, because if you could not why should anyone?

Honour had been used against her, but that did not mean honour was wrong. Only that the wicked had been cleverer than she.

“Having the sharpest blade,” she quietly said, “that’s not what honour is. It is defending the weak, it is doing the right thing. Even when it costs you.”

The Fisher did not even turn her way.

“Then perish.”

It was not a test, Angharad Tredegar then understood. It had never been. This was no tale of the Fifth Branch, where the clever princess moved the heart of the spirit with her honour. No play where her perseverance would be rewarded with the aid of an all-powerful ally, not even a song of cleverness and guile. The old monster she had made a pact with had wanted her to be a worse woman than she was, and now that she refused to be that monster would let her die. And the utter dismissal, the casual disinterest, was what burned her most. Because had the spirit not known who she was, when they made their pact? And now it shamed her for it, as if being anything but a selfish pit of despair was some sort of sin.

“What did you choose me for, if not this?” Angharad snarled. “What else, if not honour?”

Below the waters, one of the shadows bit the bait. It struggled after, scared and hurting and somehow knowing it was going to die.

“I remember them shouting of it,” the Fisher said, “when the ships first landed on our shores.”

Arms like towers pulled, ripping out of the water a wriggling shape that Angharad’s eyes shied away from. It was caught in a great palm, the barbed hook deftly slid out of shadowy flesh.

“Honour, honour!” the spirit laughed. “They raised it a banner, bedecked their champions in it, painted it on the lips of their queens.”

The wriggling thing fought with terror’s strength, but for all its efforts it did not slip the Fisher’s grasp. Angharad could not see the old spirit’s face but she knew it was smiling, just as she knew that part of her would have wept at the sight of it. The Fisher’s fingers squeezed, and after a wet and ugly crack the wriggling thing no longer wiggled at all.

“How sweet it made their screams taste, when my teeth cracked their bones.”

Angharad shivered as the spirit tossed the broken thing into the basket, where the dead flesh spread terror like poison in a cup.

“They loved their honour so much, your forebears,” the Fisher reminisced, “that I nailed them to the Young Shore so they might sing of it on the wind for their coming kin to hear.”

Oh Sleeping God, Angharad trembled. What have I done?

“There were so many the sea turned red,” the spirit told her lovingly, “that not even seagulls could drown out the screams.”

What had she sworn to free or die trying?

“Honour?” the Fisher said. “I would not give wind for honour. I gifted you my sagacity, child, because you hate them. Because you fear them.”

And on the water before them Angharad saw scrawled the nightmare of the night where her life had been broken forever, the fire and the screams and the blood on the stone. Her breath caught in her throat and she did not deny the spirit’s words for they were the truth.

Angharad Tredegar would avenge her family.

That oath she could not break, not without killing what was left of the girl who had been daughter of Rhiannon and Gwydion Tredegar. And if she killed that girl, what was even left?

“It has become half your name,” the spirit said. “You cannot renounce that, so the journey has become inevitable.”

The Fisher slowly turned, and before her trembling gaze fled to the stones at her feet the Pereduri glimpsed trails of ichor on grey flesh.

“There is poison in your veins, Angharad Tredegar,” the Fisher fondly said, “and when you learn to drink of it, you will become a thing of dread. One fit to break the locks on my cage.”

And as Angharad looked down at her boots, she saw the mistake at last. Because the spirit had cut to the bone of her, but he had not done it without a price to himself: he had revealed of him as much as he stripped bare of her. I gave you my sagacity, the Fisher had said. Nor merely a boon or a sliver of power, but a part what he was. That was not a small thing, one without costs or one that could easily taken back. If she died, he would lose something – and not least of it what the spirit thought was a chance of someone capable of freeing him.

Her gaze rose back to the water, finding once more Augusto Cerdan’s feverishly triumphant gaze looking back at her.

“You need me,” Angharad quietly said.

“There are others,” the Fisher said, “and my nature is patient.”

“But not wasteful,” she said. “You brought me here for a reason, Fisher. To learn your answer, so that I might beat the eldest law. You do not want me to be dead for all that you castigate me. You want me to be strong.”

For that is the only way you think I will ever be able to free you, she thought.

“Go on, then,” Angharad Tredegar said, forcing herself to look at the face of horror. “Show me your way.”

She saw nothing, only grey and shadow and ichor, yet still her eyes watered with tears. Then she smelled blood, felt it inside her mouth and sliding down her cheeks. She did not flinch or look away. The Fisher laughed: a ship breaking on a reef, a shield wall shattering.

“I am no peddler god, child,” the spirit said. “I gave you a gift of blood and bone, which you have not learned to use. Did I give you eyes or my own sagacity?”

“Then teach me,” Angharad challenged.

“That is why you are here,” the Fisher said. “You lessen yourself, clinging to your body like the shore. That is a child’s fear.”

The great spirit’s voice rang like a decree.

“Slay it,” he said. “Embrace the water.”

She watched the water before her, writ with light and a tale of treachery, and took a step beyond the shore. The water was cool, cold in a way that seeped into her bones, but she pressed on. A step after another, until was swallowed whole and she opened her eyes.

—

She stood besides Angharad Tredegar, whose expression was startled fury, and stepped away.

Violence exploded, the cultists charging towards the shout and pinning the company down. Still surprised, the four behind the tree hesitated. Isabel took a crossbow bolt to the belly, falling with a scream, and Angharad Tredegar charged into the mass of warriors.

She would die, Angharad thought, it was only a matter of time.

Brun tried to sink his hatchet in Augusto Cerdan’s back, eyes shining with emotion, but Beatris stopped him. She pulled at him and Song, face conflicted, said something to both.

Angharad thought she would be able to hear, if she came closer, but she could not quite manage it.

The three fled, Augusto struck across the face when he tried to go with them. He doubled it through the clearing even as Cozme was struck with a spear and Remund lost a hand to a sword blow. Cozme tried to run, but he was caught by one of the watchers and beaten unconscious.

Angharad Tredegar killed five before Ocotlan broke her leg and Tupoc rammed his spear through her heart. She died trying to claw at his throat one last time, but her bloody fingers fell short.

—

Angharad’s head broke the water, gasping. She felt a massive hand rest atop the crown of her head.

“Do better,” the Fisher said, and forced her back under.

—

This time, Angharad Tredegar began by pulling Isabel out of the way. She ran towards the other four and Cozme Aflor took a crossbow bolt in the back halfway there. They all rushed into the clearing, sweeping over the two watchers like a tide, but the warband caught up with them before they reached the trees. Three survived to run.

Angharad Tredegar was not one of them.

—

She sucked in a breath, emerging from the water.

“Please,” Angharad said, “I need-”

“Again,” the Fisher said, and pushed her back under

—

Angharad Tredegar charged the watchers herself, hoping the others would follow. She took a wound to a thrown knife and Brun was shot in the arm, but they made it across the clearing before the warband caught up with them. She shouted an order and everyone scattered, as she did, running their own way towards the sanctuary road.

Five survived to flee.

Angharad Tredegar’s wound slowed her enough that Leander Galatas traced a Sign before her and she hit a wall that could not be seen, falling down for a hollow to knock unconscious. The warband took her.

—

“I’m drowning,” Angharad gasped. “You can’t-”

“Again,” the Fisher said.

—

Angharad Tredegar ordered them so scatter before they had finished running across the clearing.

Two survived to flee.

—

“I don’t know how,” she pleaded, mouth full of water and blood. “I can’t-”

“Then try again,” the Fisher said.

—

Nine more times she went under, until at last she found it. The loop in the hole, the winding path. And as the Fisher’s hand left her head, she fell to her knees in the shallows by the shore. Crawling as she coughed and wheezed, spitting out water tinted red.

‘’It’s too much,” she got out. “It would have killed me.”

“Without my hand, the poison will eat you from within,” the Fisher acknowledged. “But you have learned, and will learn. It is a beginning.”

It would never be like that again, Angharad grasped. No more chances by the dozen, only the poison pill she could swallow and hope not to die. But the Fisher had not lied. She could do it, now. Step out of herself, beyond what she had thought the limits of her pact: that she could only have glimpses, and only through her own eyes. And that was yet a beginning in the old spirit’s eyes. What kind of terrible gift had she bargained for? Sagging against the rocks, water still lapping at her legs, Angharad closed her eyes. Listening to her own breath, she could only think of how close she had come to drowning.

Would she have become one of those wriggling things in the water, if she had?

She stayed there on the shore, prostrated like one of the forebears the Fisher had told her he had mutilated and tortured. But like all things out of the spirit’s mouth, that had not been the story whole.

“You weren’t strong enough, in the end,” Angharad said. “My forebears, they beat you. You lost the war.”

The Fisher’s gaze rested on her.

“They bled me and bound me, Angharad Tredegar,” the Fisher said. “They stole half my name. But they could not end me, not for all their desperate bargains. So they buried me deep, where no one would find me.”

The spirit laughed but it was the sound of teeth gnashing until they shattered, of a limb dipped in scalding water.

“They should have known better. Nothing is ever lost.”

She could feel the cold leaving her, the stillness fading. This place was about to end.

“Yet you are wrong, Angharad Tredegar,” the Fisher said.

And the last thing she heard before opening her eyes chilled her blood.

“I have not lost the war: so long as I exist, it has yet to end.”

—

She grabbed Isabel by the sleeve, pulling her along. That way Remund would not hesitate to follow. Angharad ran out from the cover of the tree, the taller of the cultist watchers palming a knife as the other charged with his spear. She released Isabel’s sleeve, speeding forward, and at the last moment took a left. The thrown knife went wide, the other’s spear came for her belly but a pivot and a spin opened the charging hollow’s throat.

A heartbeat later Song shot the second watcher.

Angharad turned, only for Isabel to gasp and even Master Cozme rock back.

“Your eyes,” Isabel stammered. “There’s so much blood.”

Oh, was that why she felt so light-headed? That was unfortunate.

“Contract,” she curtly said. “The three of you must run west, it’s your best chance.”

“How do you-”

Angharad brushed past Remund, ignoring his question, and intercepted the last four as they rushed into the clearing with a slight delay. She needed to refine that, buy a little more time, but they would not listen if she asked. So instead she strode forward, past a haggard Brun and Beatris, and rammed her fist in Augusto Cerdan’s belly. He tried to block it but he was slow and fearful, so he was on his knees and dry retching in the heartbeat that followed.

“Tredegar, now is not the time,” Cozme called out, rushing towards them.

Good, that should do it. A glance back told her that Isabel and Remund were already running towards the woods, as she’d told them to. When Song caught up, for once looking disturbed, Angharad met her eyes. Song was always the one who listened when she gave an order, no matter the try. The noblewoman would prove worthy of that trust.

“Take them by the eastern path,” she said, gesturing at Brun and Beatris. “You can’t join up with the others, not yet.”

Song nodded, face tight.

“I will wait for you at the end of the road,” she said. “For as long as I can.”

“Sleeping God go with you,” Angharad smiled, and walked past her.

Now to find out if she had been clever enough. Cozme was helping up the traitor as the warband broke past the treeline and in that moment she saw the dilemma on the face of the white-haired priest. The man could see a pair entering the trees near the western edge of the crag, three most of the way to the eastern path and three still in the middle of the clearing. One of these was being helped up, and the one doing that was older than the runners. In the heartbeat that followed the old cultist made the easy choice, barking out his orders. The warband would go for the three sacrifices they were certain to get, writing off the rest.

The warriors came for them like a pack of wolves.

“You’ve killed us all, you bitch,” Augusto gasped out.

“You, I will most certainly kill before this is done,” Angharad agreed. “Let us find out for the rest.”

The elder Cerdan ran for it, as he had the last two glimpses, and Master Cozme followed him after hesitating for a heartbeat. Angharad instead tapped the flat of her sword against her shoulder, granting the warband an impeccable duellist’s salute and earning an absolutely delighted laugh from Tupoc Xical. Now, she thought, it was all over except the dance. She began backing away towards the east, the edge of the crag, and watched as the lead hollows hesitated. Most chose to pursue Augusto and Cozme, since she did not appear to be fleeing, including the remaining crossbowman – who’d had the gall to kill her thrice.

By the time a party gathered to corner her with her back to the cliff, she was facing only nine cultists and Tupoc’s crew. The rest were in pursuit, not yet knowing the effort was fruitless.

“Surrender, child,” the old hollow in robes told her. “You will not be harmed by our hand if you lay down your arms.”

“Come and take them, hollow,” she replied, open in her disdain.

The warriors, infuriated by her disrespect for what she still suspected to be some kind of priest, broke ranks to rush her. With that many headed her way, it should be that – ah, and there it was. Tupoc ordered his pack of traitors to hold back, going in alone. Getting her arm broken by that hammer once had been quite enough: Ocotlan was remarkably quick for a man his size. Differences in height meant the hollows reached her as an uneven line, so Angharad slid into the gap. She stepped past a wild axe swing, racking her saber down the man’s back, and pivoted as the two hollows closest turned to converge on her.

She lashed the first across the eyes before he could bring up his sword, ignoring his scream in favour of stepping out of a thrusting spear. She avoided the point but the cultist was skilled enough to slap her shoulder with the haft, which hurt but more importantly slowed her. She was more tired than she had been in the glimpses. Her body did not move as quickly and it was only getting worse. She stepped further away from the cliff, letting the warriors converge on her from all sides except the back, then when enough were committed shecharged.

The spears got in each other’s way, needing too much space for how close the warriors were, and she ducked under a sword blow to hammer her shoulder into the hollow’s chest. It hurt her more than him – he was wearing a breastplate – but he was knocked down and she stepped over him. Not quite quickly enough to avoid a cut in the back of her shoulder, just to the side of the bag still fastened there, but the axeman got a little too close and she hacked halfway through his wrist before dancing away. Towards the ledge, counting her steps so she would not fall over it. That had been a most embarrassing death. Two had been made unable to fight, a respectable beginning, but it would not last.

Tupoc had stayed out of it so far, watching her fight with smiling pale eyes, but when he struck it was the same way he always did.

He waited until the hollows that’d run into each other spread out into a half circle, this time the spearmen keeping careful distance from each other, and when they struck he slid past them – after tripping a spearman into her without batting an eye. She sliced open the spearman’s throat without hesitattion and kicked him back into Tupoc, but the Aztlan was too quick. He danced around the corpse, his strange segmented spear feinting for her throat and scoring a mark against her cheek when she was forced to parry. She saw the sword move from the corner of her eye and knelt, slicing through the back of the hollow’s right knee and pushing him over the edge while he screamed.

Four now, she was near the right amount. The only trouble was that handling Tupoc in a fight was like kissing a viper, a truth the Aztlan kept fresh by forcing her to throw herself to the side to avoid being impaled. She slashed at the closest hollow’s ankles to force her to keep back, but Tupoc smashed the middle of her back with the butt of his spear and she let out a hiss of pain. Rolling over she slashed his way, letting him dance back, and/

The hollow rammed the spear through the back of her right knee, ripping a scream from her throat

/stepped to the right, letting out a scream as her veins burned. Her muscles spasmed, her heart beat wildly and Angharad thought that if she glimpsed even once more today her veins would fill with smoke. She had used the Fisher’s gift all too much. The hollow that’d almost impaled her took advantage of her span of weakness, striking her in the belly with the side of his spear, but Angharad took the hit and grabbed the shaft. Grunting with effort, feet spread wide, she forced the man into Tupoc’s path – who pushed him off the ledge without pause – and threw the spear in the legs of the hollow coming from her side. She needed space, just a little more space, to get to the right place.

Gritting her teeth, she rushed the hollow she’d just thrown the spear at and hacked at his face. Only it was hasty blow, awkwardly placed, and his parry caught it clean. It held her in place just long enough for another warrior to narrowly land a blow against her head, cutting through braids and scalp before she rammed her saber through his wide-open guard and plunged it through his eye. Withdrawing, blood dripping down her face, she fled into the space she had made just as Tupoc came for her. This was never a fight she was going to win, no matter how many times she tried, and if she even won too much of it the result would be her death.

If they hated her too much, they would make sure she was dead.

Just as her backfoot slid past a trail of wildflowers, Angharad stepped closer to the ledge and parried Tupoc’s thrust. He redirected it to hit the side of her knee, but she came even closer to the edge and the Aztlan saw his opening. Pivoting so he was facing her with the cliff behind her, he twirled his spear. The trick had killed her, the first time he pulled it out. Now she could only hope she had read it right because everything depended on it. The first feint was at her right shoulder and she ignored it, preparing to catch the blow to her belly instead – that she made to parry, only to overextend and…

The spearhead ripped up and down, through her bag and shallowly on the flesh beneath.

Angharad fled the steel, stumbling back one step and then another, only to find herself leaning back at the very edge of the cliff. Tupoc’s eyes widened as she began to lose her balance, and the last saw thing she saw before toppling over the edge was the smile on his too-perfect face while he gave her a textbook-perfect duellist’s salute.

She had exactly two heartbeats to live.

The first was spent snatching the hook at the end of the rope – which she could not take out herself, they’d look for her, the bag had to be cut open so she could do it in time – and strike forward with it. Just in time for the iron hooks to sink deep into the dead tree just over the edge, her sweat-drenched fingers slipping as she desperately held on to the rope burning her hands. She smacked into the cliffside, not hard enough to fall but hard enough it jolted her spine and she had to swallow a scream of pain. Her arms burned but she held, no matter the pain she held. Below, clattering down against the rock, fell two things: the pack she no longer cared for and the saber her father had ordered made for her. She needed both hands for the rope, she’d tried it.

Surviving in honour had a price, the Fisher had not lied about that.

Folded under the log, Angharad kept her mouth shut as one of the hollows came to have a look over the edge and cursed. He yelled something back at the others in a language she did not know, stepping away, and when Tupoc came to have his look he said not a word. The one time she had killed seven, the cultists had hated her enough to look closely: they’d seen the hooks in the log and pushed it down with their spears.

“I told you she was not going to be one of the easy ones, Bishop Rholes,” Tupoc drawled in Antigua. “You should have listened.”

“You told me much, but I now question the worth of your word,” a man replied in the same tongue, heavily accented.

It was the old hollow’s voice, she recognized, the one who she thought might be a priest. Bishop must be some kind of darkling title. Angharad held on tight to the rope, pressing herself against the cliff of the crag. Already her arms ached from having borne her entire weight and more during the fall, but to loosen her grip was to die. Sweat pricked against her palms, the rough hemp of the rope helping none, and she desperately looked for an outcropping to rest her feet on. This was the farthest she had ever got with foresight, beyond this she was blind.

“How so?” Tupoc asked as he stepped away, sounding genuinely curious.

“We bargained for four,” Rholes coldly said. “You have not delivered four, Leopard Man.”

“I promised you opportunities, Bishop,” Tupoc replied. “Not birds in hand. If you could not catch as many as you wanted, that is your failure and not mine.”

Sleeping God, was she going to die here because her arms were too weak? There was nothing to hold onto, only a cliff rippling down to where her broken corpse would lie. Her boots slid against the stone and she fought down a rising panic, pulling herself up as she ignored the burn rising in her arms. That was when she saw it – not below her, but to the side. The skeletal dried remains of a bush, jutting out of the crag’s side. It was to her left and she had to wiggle to the side of the stump, dread turning her limbs to lead, then pull herself up so she could rest her foot against the stump. It was higher and now her head was slightly over the edge, so-

The dead bush gave, the old wood snapping, and she fell down half a foot as she bit down on a scream until her lip bled. She was slipping, her fingers clawing at stone, and though she still held the rope the hooks at the end of it had come half-loose from the stump. She slammed her chin into the crag’s ground, ignoring the pain as she tried to slow the slide. If she fell, if she fell… Her boot hit the bottom of the bush, a part that did not give for it was wedged into stone, and her slide came to a halt. Angharad felt like weeping with relief, but she could not.

Tough her face was half-hidden by a clump of wildflowers, through them she could see Tupoc Xical and his footpads standing with the warband of hollows. If she made too much noise, they would find out she still lived.

“- so go pick up her corpse at the bottom of the cliff,” Tupoc dismissed. “Do you expect me to roast the flesh and pour your wine as well, Rholes?”

“The god cares nothing for the flesh of the dead,” Bishop Rholes bit out. “It is the living that make worthy sacrifices.”

“If you expect resurrection of me,” the Aztlan drawled, “I can only applaud your optimism, my friend.”

Lady Acanthe let out a snigger, then hid it behind a hand when the bishop turned to glare at her. More warriors had come through the woods, bringing their numbers up to a dozen, and that was a great many more than Tupoc and his traitors. Angharad saw the anger on their pale faces, the way they bristled at the disrespect their priest was being shown, and wondered what the Aztlan’s game was. Did he really think he could win if it came to a fight?

“Four taken, four allowed through,” Rholes insisted. “If you do not live up to your end of the bargain, why should we?”

The largest of the two Aztlan, Ocotlan, leaned forward with an ugly grin as he hefted his large hammer over his shoulder.

“You don’t want anything to do with that scrap, hollow,” he said. “Believe me.”

One of the hollows, wearing a shirt of iron mail, spat to the side and came to stand by his priest with his hand on his sword.

“Let us fight them, lord,” he said. “We will take them all to the temple, I swear it. Their disrespect demands punishment.”

Tupoc’s footpads stirred in unease, for the hollows were reaching for their arms. Swords and spears and axes, even two crossbows. However skilled a warrior, numbers were not something easily challenged,

“He won’t do that,” the eerie Aztlan smiled, raising his right wrist. “Will you, Bishop?”

On it was small bracelet of beads, black stones sculpted in the Aztlan style. Angharad’s gaze dipped to Bishop Rholes, who was rubbing an identical bracelet worn on his left wrist. The old hollow’s face was considering, and after pulling away from the bracelet he tugged at his white beard.

“I think,” Bishop Rholes slowly said, “that two is not enough. That you are short enough of the oath that I will be afforded enough room.”

Tupoc’s face was a smiling mask, but some with him were easier to read.

“He might be right,” Leander Galatas nervously said. “If he tries to take us prisoner instead of kill us, he might not forfeit his heart.”

His leader, the traitor of traitors, eyed him with dislike. A glance was enough to have the gaunt man flinching back, reaching for the arm he’d lost on the Bluebell before proving himself a man without honour.

“You would take such a risk out of petty spite?” Tupoc lightly said. “I do not think you so careless, Rholes.”

“Two,” the bishop flatly repeated, “is not enough. I already took a risk on this bargain, Leopard Man. I will not return to my god with such petty offerings.”

“That is troubling,” Tupoc replied.

He hummed, prowling back and forth like the great cat after which his society had been named. His gaze swept around, thoughtful, and for a terrifying heartbeat Angharad thought he had seen her through the flowers. But his gaze moved on and lingered on the hollows, as if measuring them, before he let out a sigh.

“Very well,” he said, and struck Leander Galatas in the belly.

The sailor gasped in pain, bending forward, and before he could so much as trace a Sign the Aztlan grabbed him by the head and smashed it into his knee. Galatas dropped to the ground in a sprawl, bloody-faced and unconscious. Tupoc took a step back, ignoring the horrified look Acanthe Phos was shooting him just as much as Ocotlan’s mocking chuckle.

“Three for three, then,” Tupoc offered the bishop. “That should sate your god and our terms both.”

Bishop Rholes laughed.

“A true son of the Radiance,” he said. “Not a speck of loyalty in you.”

Tupoc arched a too-prefect brow, as if to ask him to get on with it.

“The bargain holds,” Rholes conceded. “You may reach the sanctuary under blessing of peace.”

Neither side was eager to remain after that, the cultists taking their wounded and their fresh sacrifice before heading south. The search for Cozme and Augusto, she saw, had been called off: the warriors that’d gone after them returned empty-handed, following their brethren south. Tupoc and his remaining helpers began heading north after they went, towards the road that would lead to sanctuary. Only the Aztlan begged off leaving immediately, telling them to go ahead, and he headed towards the edge of the cliff the moment they entered the woods. Panic rising, Angharad lowered herself past the edge of the cliff. Even if she fought him and win, the noise was sure to bring back hollows. If he found her, she was dead.

Not even ten heartbeats later pale eyes looked down at her from over the ledge, taking in her situation with nothing but amusement.

“I told you,” Tupoc Xical conversationally said, “that you would regret not coming with me.”

“Damn you,” Angharad hissed. “Damn you for this and for all-”

The Aztlan reached down, pressing the butt of his spear against her forehead, and she swallowed her anger. Drops of cold sweat ran down her back. All he needed to do was push and down she went.

“That’s better,” Tupoc smiled.

He suddenly burst forward, and though it took all she had Angharad did not allow herself to flinch. And that was all he’d sought, she realized a heartbeat later, for her to flinch: the spear had not moved so much as a hair’s breadth. Those unnatural pale eyes had watched her all the while and finally the Aztlan nodded.

“You are a delight,” Tupoc Xical said with satisfaction, drawing back. “I look forward to working with you in the second trial, Lady Tredegar.

The spear withdrew and the monster offered her a salute with it.

“Until then, a good day to you.”

And just like that, he left. From her sight first, then disappearing into the woods where the others had gone. Angharad, breathing shallow, dragged herself over the edge. There she lay in the dirt, sweaty and bloody and caked in filth. Her body burned, but not half as much as the indignation in her belly.

Swallowing the scream in her throat, Angharad Tredegar pushed herself up to her feet and began her walk to the Trial of Ruins.

# Chapter 17



Tristan, sitting on a stone, idly strummed at strings that did not exist. The supplicant’s cithara in his hands was but a petrified piece of wood without the additional accessory of a priest with mastery of the Gloam to weave strings and pluck at them. The first might not be so impossible, but the second was rather more of a hurdle. So, in the hours past midnight but before they left, Tristan asked a burning question.

“Can you play cithara?”

Sarai eyed him like he’d tracked mud all over her nice Izcalli carpet.

“Can you dance the moravac?” she shot back.

The thief duly considered this.

“I’ve never tried,” he said.

“There’s your answer,” Sarai easily replied.

He supposed it would have been a too lucky for one of them to be able to play the ancient magical instrument he’d dug up from the shrine. As expected, he would have to scrap it for parts. Tristan would have liked to keep the cithara for the rest of the trials, but its bellyful of feathers would do the trick instead – if only the once. Sarai’s blue eyes remained on him, scrutinizing.

“You’re scheming again,” she noted.

“I would never,” Tristan lied.

“We’re not betraying Ferranda,” Sarai reminded him. “She’s lovely and her relationship with Sanale is very romantic.”

He blinked at her in surprise.

“Her what?” he repeated.

“Tristan,” Sarai patiently said, “they have two bedrolls but only one gets mussed. Either one of them sleeps on stone or they’re fucking.”

He’d actually thought Sanale was being very neat.

“They don’t act like it,” he said.

Tristan himself might not partake, but he had learned to recognize the signs of people being lovers. He’d caught on that things between the pair were not quite as simple as mistress and hired hand, but he’d not seen any telltale marks of there being a physical dalliance.

“They’re probably used to being discreet,” she shrugged. “She’s a noble, right? I imagine her family would disapprove.”

“They likely don’t know,” Tristan frowned.

The way that Sanale was not a corpse floating by Fisherman’s Quay was something of an indication. The thief could not remember ever hearing House Villazur before, but the other infanzones had treated Ferranda as one of them so she should not be an impostor. It must be one of the lesser houses, those barely above merchant households in means. The kind that needs to marry its children well to keep the lamps lit, he thought. He thought he might have an inkling of what Ferranda Villazur was after by coming to the Dominion of Lost Things, and thus was forced into the unpleasant experience of feeling the barest kernel of respect for an infanzona.

This island truly was full of trials.

“I’ll be keeping faith,” Tristan told his companion, returning to the thread. “I am only considering the ways our efforts might turn sour.”

“We are taking risks,” Sarai acknowledged. “But there is no way forward without doing so.”

The lay of their plan was simple enough. Yong and Ferranda had found cultists encamped in the woods to the east of the bridge and killed a fox on the way back. Their company was to approach the camp while the hollows slept, then Tristan would stuff the fox carcass with every drop of lodestone extract he had left. One of the three among them that did not bumble in the woods would plant the carcass in the cultist camp, at which point their group would begin a circuitous route west while waiting for the heliodoran beast to attack the hollows. With both their obstacles keeping each other busy, they were then to run for the bridge in relative safety and hope the great lemure did not finish the cultists off before they could cross.

It was going to blow up in their faces.

If someone asked him why he was so sure of that Tristan would have struggled to answer, but within the enclosure of his own mind it seemed obvious. It was in the moving parts, the hitch of the clock, the ringing of the coin as it spun up: debacle was in the air. Too much neatness was being relied on and if years with Fortuna’s had taught Tristan Abrascal anything it was how to sniff out a coming debacle. Now, the clever thing would be to find his way out and prepare for when firmament dropped on their heads – ensure, by hook or crook, that he was not the one of the lost.

But the thief gotten greedy since he sailed to the Dominion. Too used to the shelter of companions that would not easily betray him, to others keeping their word and expecting his to be kept. To all the comforts that were a slow poison, dulling your edge and lulling your eyes into closing. Never grow roots, Abuela had taught him. Trees are good only for felling. Hard as the lesson had been to live up to, it had also kept him alive: how many times had he crossed a slumlord or a gang only for their swaggering bullies to find he was a ghost? No home, no haunts, no ties. No man could take revenge on morning mist.

Tristan had not forgot the methods through which he’d stayed alive so long, how in his own way he’d come to thrive – a fatter rat than most – but still he found his mind spinning out the wrong plans. Tacking on demands, like keeping Song and Sarai alive. Vanesa as well, the thought crept in, but bit down on it. If he opened the door to the old woman then Francho would not be far behind and soon he would like a miner out of the Trenches: back breaking for the weight of the stones he carried.

“When it comes tumbling down, and it will, come find me,” Tristan said. “I may be able to keep us alive.”

The heliodoran beast was clever, for a lemure: not the kind of creature that would eat poison if it could smell it. And it so happened that Tristan had a cithara’s worth of something the beast would want to avoid.

If he stretched them thin, there might be feathers enough for three.

—

Traipsing through the woods was significantly more unpleasant when they were wet.

It had rained while Yong and Ferranda went looking for the cultists and gods but he wished it had been long enough since for the forest to dry. Vanesa thrice tripped on a slippery root she misjudged the distance of before he asked Aines to stay with her, Felis kept shivering from the cold – a fresh lick of dust courtesy of Lan had perked him up but also made him feverish – and with the rain washing off many of the marks Ferranda had left they’d got lost for half an hour. Sanale took the lead in her place, effectively trailblazing, which slowed them down further. They advanced with the lanterns veiled until only the barest slice of light showed, a procession trying to be quiet but falling short of success.

At least no one was chatting.

With Sarai ahead of him and Francho behind, the thief had much room to move and so he was left alone with his thoughts. It was not a blessing: with only himself for company, they kept going in increasingly grim circles. Perhaps it was his discomfort with the woods or simply the way the darkness seemed like it kept closing in from all sides, but part of him could not help but feel they were walking to their deaths. As if they had all missed a knife with their names written on the blade. The same instincts that had guided him in Sacromonte insisted he was making a mistake and it frustrated him not to know if it was unease talking or if he should be listening.

“You look like you’re chewing on a lemon,” Fortuna told him.

“I feel as if I am pulling a noose around my neck,” Tristan muttered back. “How else should I look?”

Pondering this, the goddess mimed pulling at a rope above her head and rolled her eyes before lolling out her tongue.

“Mwore like tshis,” she informed him.

It was one of the keenest comforts of Tristan’s life that other people could not see Fortuna. 

And to think some scholars insisted gods were fonts of wisdoms, that their words could open up fresh realms of understanding. Still, his lips twitched. Any moment now – the golden-haired goddess, still taunting him with rolled up eyes, walked backwards straight into a tree. This did not actually hurt her in any way, but as tended to be the way when she ran into things without noticing Fortuna emerged on the other side glaring at the tree as if she had been personally attacked. However grim the situation, watching the Lady of Long Odds begin yet another implacable blood feud with an inanimate object did wonders for his mood.

She’d once spent an entire month trying to talk him into tearing down a worn statue of Emperor Pere after passing through it mid-sentence. Tristan, naturally, had instead paid the matron of the house across the street to thoroughly clean it. Best nine radizes he’d ever spent.

Ducking under a low branch, the thief followed the sight of Sarai’s back. She had cut away at her skirts since her face was revealed, making slits so they could more easily be run in, and taken off her gloves. She still carried only a knife for weapon, but what did she need blades and powder when she could call on the powers of the Gloam? The thief bit his lip, hard enough he almost drew blood. He was still tired from running through last night, despite the rest since, and their pace through the woods was slow enough it was not the first time he’d caught his mind beginning to wander to nowhere. He’d be of no use to anyone, not even himself, if the cultists got the drop on him.

And the cult of the Red Eye was certain to have watchers. Their warband had raised its camp far from where their group had encountered the airavatan, but there was always a risk. It would have been madness not to keep a full watch with the likes of a heliodoran beast prowling the woods.  

The darkling camp Yong and Ferranda had found was about an hour to the east of the bridge, in the woods facing the tall grass. It was by the river – which, this far east, was at the bottom of a wide ravine. The way the pair told it, they had found the hollows half by chance: it had begun to rain violently while they were out and during the storm part of the cliff the cultists had made their camp broke off and collapsed into the ravine. If not for the ruckus that had made, the pair might have missed the darklings entirely for their camp was well-hidden behind a tall thicket of trees and broken ring of raised stones.

Sarai slowed in front of him, then weaved behind a tree. Following quietly, Tristan found that in the small clearing before him – little more than a dozen feet of room between trees, all wet earth and stinking dead leaves – most of their party had stopped. The two who had been leading them, Yong and Sanale, must have called a halt. He joined them to find out why, the informal circle that’d formed to make decisions assembling in short order: Ferranda and Sanale, he and Yong and Sarai. And Lan, who instead of chasing away he made eye contact with.

The blue-lipped Tianxi met his gaze and dipped her head in acknowledgement of the debt – he could force to leave but had not – and he looked away to find Sarai’s lips twitching as she made no pretence she had not been watching them. As tended to be the way with her, he was left feeling wretchedly bare.

“We are close to the camp,” Yong told them. “No more than half an hour at our current pace.”

“We were supposed to get closer still,” Ferranda Villazur said. “Why stop now?”

Tristan forced himself not to look at Vanesa, who had been lagging behind even with Aines’ help. It was close to morning now, as they’d left only after everyone grabbed a few hours of sleep in anticipation of the early start, but at her age that made little difference. It won’t be about her, besides, he thought. Yong had never been shy about his belief that if the greyhairs could not keep up they should be left behind.

“I found tracks,” Sanale said.

“From your tone,” Sarai slowly said, “they are not ours from earlier.”

He shook his head.

“Fresh.”

“There should not be anyone from the Bluebell left around here,” Lan noted. “That leaves only hollows.”

Or the Watch, Tristan thought, but they should not be involving themselves in the Trial of Lines.

“At least ten,” Sanale said, “but they are good. Could be more. All moving east, quiet but quick.”

“If they were friends to the warband in the camp,” the thief said, “they should have no reason to be sneaking around.”

“They could be hiding from the airavatan,” Sarai suggested.

“This far east?” Yong said. “If it were anywhere near here it should have already found the camp. They must be hiding from the other hollows.”

Tristan did not disagree. The beast had last been seen hours to the west and it had no reason to push this far east save the hollow camp – which would already be as a graveyard, if the airavatan had caught scent of it.

“That complicates things,” Ferranda Villazur grimaced. “We don’t want to be caught in the middle of a cult war.”

“If we let them get into a scrap first, it will become be easier to plant the carcass,” Tristan pragmatically said.

“We don’t know if they will fight,” Yong said. “They could band together. And even if they do, it might not be anytime soon.”

It was early morning still, before the dawning hour where most of Sacromonte woke, so Tristan would admit it was a toss-up: there was no telling whether this fresh warband would want to press on to strike while the other hollows were asleep or rest instead.

“We must track them and find out,” Ferranda said.

“It would be dangerous to try the cultist camp before we know we won’t be attacked from behind,” Sarai agreed.

So did Tristan, as it happened, and the rest of them. Ferranda and Sanale were the ones who headed out into the woods, the rest of their company waiting in the clearing and huddling for warmth until the pair returned with news. The thief lowered himself to the ground and rested his back against a tree, closing his eyes to enjoy the break – though not so much he ever ceased listening to the noises around him. All this talk of ambushes had his nerves thin. Before long he heard someone heading his way, though what he found when he opened his eyes surprised him. Francho, hand smoothing back what few wisps of white hair remained atop his head, came to plop himself down by his side.

The old professor held his flat cap tucked under the arm of his worn green coat, pulled tight enough around his neck that only the collar of his cotton shirt showed. His boots were of good make and obviously new, but his breeches were labourer’s clothes in dull brown whose seams were beginning to give. He was dressed, Tristan thought, like a man who had raided his wardrobe for clothes he thought fitting for the countryside and put them out without thought to what fit and not. You bought the boots just for the Dominion, didn’t you? That was telling, the thief thought. Francho, unlike Vanesa, still had an eye to living through this.

The toothless old man let out a sigh when he rested his back against the tree, fruitlessly trying to pull his coat even tighter.

“Try to gather your strength,” Tristan advised. “This is the last breath before the plunge.”

“So I’ve gathered,” Francho agreed. “It has been an interesting few days, Tristan. I have seen things I never thought I might.”

“That temple was stripped clean,” the thief drily said. “Is a single supplicant’s cithara enough to please you so?”

“I went treasure hunting when I was a youth, so empty temples are old hand to me,” the old man chuckled. “Three expeditions in the isles of Nemn, though our captains were so careful bolder hunters had already emptied the ruins.”

The thief hid his surprise. The isles of Nemn were famous in Sacromonte: treasure hunters had been sailing there for decades yet were said to have found no more than a third of the islands. Many of them could only be reached if their name was known, some ancient Antediluvian aether machine otherwise keeping them hidden. Once every decade or so, when a new name was dug up by scholars, every treasure crew south of Ixion’s Lighthouse competed to be the first to plunder the depths. The stories Tristan heard made it plain the crews were as dangerous to each other as the dead gods and the traps, not at all the kind of place he imagined a man who taught at the University of Reve might go.

“What was it that surprised you, then?” he asked.

The old man paused for a moment.

“That young girl on the ship,” he said. “I never caught her name.”

Tristan’s belly clenched. There was only one he could be meaning.

“Marzela,” he said. “Her name was Marzela.”

Francho sighed, which set him to coughing into his hand. The cough never got worse but neither did ever seem to go away, which had left the thief to wonder whether it was from the depredations of old age or from a contract’s price.

“A tragedy,” Francho said. “It always is, when a god takes one of us, but I had never thought to see a Saint with my own eyes.”

“I could do without seeing it again,” Tristan said.

“Oh,” Francho softly said, “I agree.”

A hesitant pause.

“Have you read what Alizia Arquer wrote on the three modes of the divine?” Francho asked.

Tristan cocked an eyebrow. As a matter of fact, he had. Abuela had obtained for him the extract of the work being referred to, The Sea of Shapes, concerning the subject. He had been interested enough to track down a complete copy afterwards. He’d even set aside his distaste for the family name involved – the Arquer were one of the Six, the infanzones of infanzones – and paid proper coin for it. Stealing from those who peddled witch books was a fool’s bargain.

“Perception, dislocation and manifestation,” Tristan quoted.

These were the three modes through which gods interacted with the material, according to Lady Arquer. Perception, for a god to make themselves seen to a mortal, was the most basic. Even the most destitute of deities could do it and it was the limit of Fortuna’s own power. Gods who were still little more than shapes in the aether first brushed against Vesper this way, reaching through places or times matched to their nature. Tristan himself had met Fortuna at his lowest, hiding in a shattered shrine with no way to live save beating long odds.

Dislocation was the act through which a god brought a mortal into themselves, a connection of souls that could not be done without an existing bridge – usually a contract. It was an experience supposedly much like a vision, the world around you grinding to a halt until the god released their hold. Even that was a trick of perception, however, for no god was powerful enough to halt the march of Vesper: it was only by bringing a soul into themselves that could cheat and make a single heartbeat seem an hour.

The last was manifestation, what all gods relentlessly sought: to become physical, aether manifest. In Lady Arquer’s words, ‘to overcome entropy, existence becoming less effort than absence’. It could only be achieved through mortals – by contracts, sacrifice and prayer. The Manes, those old gods who were patrons to the infanzones, were said to have walked the world since before the fall of Liergan. Not all need be so old, forever. The Old Alcazar, the broken fortress at the heart of Sacromonte turned temple district, was full of temples and shrines to gods manifest. It wasn’t only the nobles that saw divinity in the flesh either.

Even the Murk had a few, though only fools bargained with gods who chose to make their home among squalor and desperation.

“Lady Alizia’s works have long been of interest to the university,” Francho said. “The Arquer now jealously hoard their secrets, so it has been the work of generations to expand on the original postulations.”

Tristan was not surprised at the secrecy: the Arquer were famous for being able to forge ‘legacy’ contracts, bargains with gods that were passed down the bloodline. They sold that expertise for riches and favours, and whether you were a the most splendid of infanzones or the lowest of rats no one liked to share their begging bowl.

“I was once friends with the Master of Aetheric Studies, Tristan,” Francho continued with forced nonchalance, “and she told me of an experiment made on the nature of sainthood.”

“Did she,” Tristan frowned, grown wary of the conversation.

He could not grasp where the old professor was headed and it raised his hackles. This was not idle conversation, he could tell that much.

“The question to be resolved was as follows: does one absolutely need to draw on a contract for the process of sainthood to begin, or is continued exposition to the lesser modes – perception and dislocation – enough on its own?”

The thief stilled. So that was what this conversation was about. He met the man’s dark eyes.

“You heard me talking,” he said.

Francho coughed, the sound of wet as the saliva flecking his lips.

“I saw your lips move,” he said. “And once I thought of it, it is not so hard to put together: how often did I see you looking at something in the dark or muttering to yourself? I had though it a nervous habit.”

Fortuna leaned against the tree, cocking an eyebrow as her red dress trailed in the muck and leaves.

“I thought it would be Sarai that caught us,” the goddess admitted. “Interesting.”

Tristan forced himself not to look. It was more habit than need, for already he knew that denial was not on the table.

“I am not in danger of sainthood,” Tristan replied in a murmur. “There is no need to worry.”

He would have preferred to dismiss the professor entirely but that would be unwise. If Francho took this to the others out of fear, the thief might well be cast out of their company: no one would want to take a risk with a Saint. The old man grimaced.

“I understand your god may be assuring you of that,” the old professor gently said, “but perception is not meant to last so long. I imagine it began when you made your contract. How long have you been continuously seeing them – a week, a month? The danger now grows by the hour.”

Fortuna laughed. He kept his face blank.

“Pretend,” the thief slowly said, “that it has been a year.”

“Or ten,” the goddess added.

Francho peered at him dubiously.

“That is…” he began, then stopped. “You are serious.”

“I am.”

“Your god should be dead,” the scholar said. “Perception takes power, and the god does not devour you at the end then it is frittering itself away for nothing. Once it has spent itself, its consciousness will fade back into the aether.”

The thief flicked up a glance at Fortuna, who looked as baffled as he felt.

“It feels more natural to be with you than not,” the goddess told him. “Tell the idiot I have not grown weaker.”

“It says it has not faded since starting,” Tristan duly repeated.

Fortuna, scowling, began reaching for his hear as if threatening to pull at it.

“She,” he hastily revealed. “She says.”

“It,” Fortuna repeated in disgust. “You calamitous brat, how dare you deny my beauty for even an instant? Poets wept at my leaving, Tristan, they fucking wept.”

Alas, they had company so he could ask her whether she was sure they had not been weeping until she left. Francho’s eyes were wide and alight.

“Fascinating,” the old professor murmured. “The study of gods is the study of exceptions so the cry of impossibility is that of a fool, but never have I seen our understanding of the modes so contradicted. Your goddess must be extraordinary.”

A heartbeat passed.

“I’ve changed my mind,” Fortuna announced, preening against the tree. “He is obviously a man of piercing insight.”

Tristan supposed it was senseless to call flattery a weakness when the Lady of Long Odds was made up mostly of those in the first place. Describing her by her strengths would be like describing a sinking ship by how well its sails could catch the wind: not untrue but rather missing the point.

“A discussion for another time,” Tristan calmly replied, quite possibly meaning never. “I hope your concerns were set to rest.”

The scholar looked puzzled, for a moment, and only then remembered how their conversation had begun. He coughed in embarrassment.

“Yes, naturally, of course,” Francho hurriedly said. “I did not mean to pry into your affairs, my boy. It was only worry.”

“I understand,” Tristan said, and in truth he did.

He had not enjoyed the polite interrogation, for that was what their talk had been, but he might well have done the same in the other man’s shoes. The professor still felt guilty, however, it was plain on his face. In practice he had asked of Tristan’s contract, which was the kind of thing some people pulled knives over. The guilt made the man babble, seeking to fill the silence. After a few aborted attempts at idle talk he fell back on safer grounds.

“I have been listening to old stones,” Francho said. “The raised ring of stones where Yong and Lady Villazur found the hollow camp, you might be interested to hear it is only one of many.”

Tristan cocked an eyebrow.

“I am,” he admitted. “There are others?”

“I am not sure of the number, but there will be others along the length of the river splitting the island,” the professor said. “More interesting yet, I believe them built by the same people who raised the shrine were we found Lady Villazur. The cultists care not for them, save as building materials.”

“So what were they for?” he asked. “They do not look like shrines.”

“I cannot tell,” Francho enthusiastically said. “Some voices speak of ritual killing, but that may be the work of the Red Eye – it can be hard to tell the when and who of what I hear. I find intriguing, however, that they were raised along the river. Many cultures saw running water as a metaphysical boundary: the rings could be meant to strengthen or weaken it.”

The chatted for a while still in low voices, Tristan keeping the talk going in part to distract from their earlier one. Twice he raised his voice when speaking of the stones when someone was close, the second time when it was Lan. That should throw them off the tracks of the earlier conversation. The talk was long done by the time Ferranda and Sanale returned.

Their faces were grim. The news were not good.

“We did not find them,” the Malani bluntly said.

The man’s directness was starting to grow on him. It had a certain charm to it.

“The trail cut off after a field of gravel,” Ferranda added. “There is no telling if they are still around.”

Tristan took off his hat – which was doing a delightful job of keeping dripping water off his scalp, a testament to the occasional Malani stroke of brilliance – and passed a hand through his hair.

“We need to plant the bait on the cultists anyway,” he said. “If we wait too long they’ll break camp and our plan is good as finished.”

None of them liked the additional risk, but what choice did they have? It was simple but careful work, stuffing the dead fox with lodestone extract. Lady Villazur had caught the animal the back with a throwing knife – one he’d never seen her use, caution he could only approve of – so he had to widen the wound a bit before inserting the substance. He made sure wash his hands careful with alcohol after. There was less of it left than he would have liked.

“Careful not to get any on you,” he warned.

Lady Ferranda silently nodded. She and Yong were the ones to set out for the cultist camp again, leaving the rest of them to wait in that same clearing. There was no point in finding a better hiding place when the trees and stones here would serve fine. Tristan helped a tired Vanesa to fold her legs beneath a jutting rock, tucked away out of sight. The bandage around her eye was red again, he saw with a grimaced. But he only had one roll of makeshift bandages left and this would keep for a while still so he did not make the offer.

“We are almost through,” Tristan told her. “Once we cross the bridge it should be a clear path to the second trial.”

It would be senseless for cultists to wait in ambush past the bridge when the bridge was already being guarded. He could not be sure, of course, but he doubted there would be much trouble on the last stretch of the journey. Vanesa wanly smiled.

“My legs won’t give yet, don’t worry,” she said. “It is these cursed roots that are never where they should be.”

“Once we’re sure the beast is on the hollows, we’ll open the lanterns wide,” he told her. “It will be easier to move for us all.”

Sanale had done the rounds while he busied himself with the old woman, nudging the few lacking in prudence to find better places, and now there were only the two of them left. The huntsman took him aside. Tristan had never gotten so close a look at the beadworks on the man’s cloak and shirt before: they were all sharp angles and deep colors, though nothing so bright it would stand out in the woods. The thief had heard that all the clothes adorned with the same that were sold in Sacramonte were fakes, for beadwork was particular to the northern Low Isle and the colored patterns particular to family clans of that storm-wracked land. The other man sought and held his gaze.

“The beast might catch us,” Sanale grunted.

Tristan’s brow rose.

“It is a risk,” he cautiously agreed.

“If it do,” the huntsman says, “and you betray us, I will shoot you first.”

The thief’s eyes narrowed.

“That sounds like a threat,” he said.

“Is,” Sanale said, sounding pleased at his quick understanding. “So don’t. Fuck infanzones, but not Ferranda.”

“I thought it was the very opposite, with you two,” he drily replied.

The Malani frowned, confusion pulling at his scarred cheeks – little smooth stripes Tristan had never noticed before, none thicker than a razor blade. The man’s Antigua might not be good enough for wordplay the thief eventually admitted.

“You and her,” he said instead.

Sanale’s face brightened with understanding and he nodded.

“Yes,” he said. “She is not like the others. So don’t betray, or I’ll kill you.”

Well, that did have the benefit of being impeccably straightforward. No nuances to get lost in.

“I won’t,” Tristan assured him.

The Malani eyed him for a while, then slowly nodded.

“She thinks Sarai runs you,” Sanale said. “But I don’t. You’re more like umndeni.”

A word in Umoya, Tristan thought, but not one he recognized.

“We’re allies,” he shrugged.

“We should be too,” the huntsman bluntly said. “Better you than infanzones. All snakes.”

Against his better judgement, the thief’s lips twitched.

“One of your own nobles went with them,” he pointed out. “Tredegar.”

Sanale snorted.

“Peers,” he said, like it explained everything.

When he saw it did not, the huntsman continued.

“Half are mad,” Sanale explained, “the other act it.”

It had the air of an old saying to it, which made it all the more amusing to hear.

“Not a great admirer of nobles, I take it,” Tristan grinned.

“My uncle shoot their taxmen when they come to the hold,” the huntsman proudly said. “Outlaw under three different names.”

It was making an increasing amount of sense to the thief how Sanale got along so well with Yong, a man who referred to nobles by a word which meant relic.

“Yours are a forward-thinking folk, Sanale,” Tristan told him. “Would that we were all so wise.”

The Malani eyed him, as if trying to ascertain if he was being made sport of, then nodded decisively.

“The Trial of Ruins needs allies,” the huntsman stated. “The weak get sold out. Think on it.”

Tristan found, to his surprise, that he was considering it. He was yet hesitant to tie himself too closely to anyone – the more interest he had to care for, the harder it would be to get a good shot at Cozme Aflor – but he could do worse for allies than this pair. They were competent, and while he did not trust Villazur in the slightest he was fairly sure that if Sanale ever intended to turn on him the knife would come from the front and not the back. The huntsman offered him a polite nod, which he returned, and then Sanale went to cut off the last lantern entirely.

There were plenty of roots and stones to hide under, but after staying so long in the same clearing Tristan was feeling restless. The brush of wind against the leaves above had him reaching for his knife, what he thought to be a bird only a shivering branch, but the idea it brought to mind pleased him.

It took a minute or two to find a halfway dry tree with branches low enough he could hoist himself up, but find it he did. The bark bit at his fingers as he climbed but the work was not arduous and once crouched on the lowest branch he found another in reach: he’d be able to get higher with little effort. Once he began rising he continued on a whim, the thought of breaking past the canopy of this damnable forest too pleasing to resist.

In a matter of minutes he broke past the leaves, face emerging for his first clear look at the sky since he’d entered the forest. The stars shone pale in the distance, their light just enough to outline the sea of trees spread out below. When squinting he could almost make out where the treeline ended to the north, the ravine where the river ran. The bridge was too far to make out. Breathing in slowly, the thief let tension bleed out of his frame. It was not in his hands whether Yong and the infanzona would succeed, all he could do was wait. Until then, he might as well take in the rare sight of a wild forest that – was that mist?

For three secondsTristan leaned forward, heart beating against his ears, and prayed to any god listening it was just some fog from the rain he saw. But it was too thick, moved too quickly. The heliodoran beast. It’s coming. It was too close for the lodestone extract to be responsible: Sanale had said the lemure saw smells as colours, but while a beacon of colour had just been lit the monster was more than halfway to the camp already. It’d already been close, but why? The thief struggled to understand where it had gone wrong, until finally he found the keystone.

Sanale had said the tracks he’d found earlier were heading east, but perhaps it might have been more accurate to say they were heading away from the west.

“It was after them,” he muttered. “Fuck.”

Sarai had been right. The cultists hadn’t been going east because they were looking for a fight with the other hollows, they were running away from the heliodoran beast. And Tristan figured they might well have lost it, because there’d been no sign of the monster, only now most of a bottle’s worth of lodestone was wafting up like a column of smoke. It was like waving a red flag before a bull. Cursing under his breath, he got moving: branch after branch, until he could leap down into the leaves. Vanesa peeked out from under her stone.

“Tristan?” she called out.

“Trouble,” he replied. “Sanale, the beast is already close.”

The Malani huntsman stepped out of the shadow between trees like he’d just manifested out of thin air, grim face gone grimmer.

“I’ll fetch them, then we run,” he said.

The addition of Yong to ‘them’ was likely more than just politeness, considering how well the pair got along. Tristan shook his head.

“I’ll go,” the thief said instead.

The man looked about to object, so he raised his hand to cut him off.

“If the people here have to run, I can’t guide them,” he said. “You can. I’ll be enough to play messenger, Sanale.”

Reluctantly, the Malani nodded. He gave few curt instructions as to the path to follow, which Tristan carefully committed to memory, and without further ceremony he went.

—

It would have been a lie to say that Tristan moved smoothly or skillfully.

He almost ripped his knee up sliding down a flat stone and used the wrong lightning-struck tree as a signpost, forcing him to double back and take a left past the running water. But he got there, and though it came at the cost of some scuffing and spitting out a mouthful of dead leaves he got to the outskirts of the cultist camp. Creeping across the wet earth he risked a look, finding a few fires lit from behind the broken ring of raised stones – of which barely half were left. The trees were thick here, so close every path needed squeezing through, but that worked in his favour for now. It would be difficult to pick him out even for a darkling.

From what he could tell the cultists were not yet awake, save for the watchers – two of which were perched atop raised stones. Now he needed to find out if Yong and Ferranda were still around, dearly hoping they hadn’t just walked past each other in the dark.

When a gloved hand coved his mouth, pulling him back, he moved without thought.

Elbow in the stomach, pivot, opposite elbow in the neck while he reached for his knife. There was a grunt behind him and he turned to see Ferranda Villazur clutching her head as she stumbled back. She was groaning in pain. Behind her Yong moved out from behind an oak’s trunk.

“You should have whistled,” the Tianxi murmured.

“I can see that now, yes,” the infanzona rasped out.

“You’re lucky I looked before using the knife,” Tristan told her, unsympathetic.

Tempted as he was to rub salt in the noble’s wound, there were more pressing matters.

“The airavatan is close,” he said. “Where is the bait?”

In the dark it was hard to make out their expressions but there was no missing how they both stiffened. Neither were fool enough to think anything but death awaited if the beast caught them.

“In a berry bush close to the edge of their camp,” Ferranda replied. “How close, Tristan?”

“I can’t be sure now, but when I left-”

He never finished the sentence.

Not for lack of trying, but because at his feet mist was billowing out. The thickness of the growth had played against him, let him miss the creeping advance until it was too late. The airavatan was here, and where its mist spread there was only silence. A shiver of dread went down his spine. If it had found them… But from the corner of his eye he saw movement near the edge of the cultist camp. In the trembling light of the fires a hulking shape approached, tearing through the trees in eerie silence. Gods, but it was so quick for a creature so large. It almost seemed delicate, the way it moved, until you saw the crushing weight it bored down on all it touched.

 Panicking hollows tried to wake their fellows without being able to scream in alarm, but it was too late. The great beast slowed only for a moment, when it reached the edge of the ring of raised stones. Tentacles carefully felt out the edge of them, and after finding what they wanted the beast burst through.

Someone pulled at his arm, and Tristan did not fight back. They ran, leaving the cultists to their death.

—

The way back was faster than when he’d come alone, but not fast enough.

They could not run as quick as Tristan felt the need to, heart racing in fear: it was dark and slippery and none of them had brought a lantern. It’d been too risky. He followed Yong’s back as best he could, tried to walk where the man walked, and only slipped the once. Neither of the others stopped for him when he did. Tristan was not angered by it, could not be when a primal terror pressed against his own back. As soon as they found the others, he thought, they must all run. The plan was not yet undone, only on the razor’s edge. They had been meant to already be getting closer to the bridge when the heliodoran beast attacked the cultist camp, but this was not beyond salvaging. If the airavatan took its time with the hollows they might still get across in time.

Tristan felt relief well up in his throat at the sight of the lightning-struck tree he recognized from earlier, knowing it meant they were close, but ahead of him the others were no longer moving. They were hiding behind the hollow of a birch, eyes ahead, and he joined them with great care to be quiet.

The rest of their crew was out of hiding, a half-open lantern by Sanale’s foot casting its glow over the clearing. The Malani huntsman had his musket out and pointed, the others around bearing their own arms. It was plain to see why: facing them were a dozen armed hollows. The other warband, Tristan thought through clenched teeth. The one that had been fleeing the beast. He pulled his knife. Yong had a pistol in hand and was already loading it with powder, while Ferranda Villazur unsheathed her sword with care to keep the sound low. They were at the back of the cultists, if they struck first…

“Peace, strangers,” a woman called out. “None of us can afford to spill blood here.”

Tristan’s eyes followed the voice and what he found gave him pause. The hollows were armed with spears and swords, a few with mail and one a breastplate, but one among them wore only robes and bore no blade. It was blonde woman with skin pale as milk and a broad face, aged around what must be late thirties. Her eyes were wide and shining, unsettlingly black. She’d caught the three of them out and the advantage now lay with her band, but the enemy did not look eager to fight – a fight Tristan’s crew might not win if they forced it. The three of them traded resigned glances before coming out of the trees, carefully circling around the darklings to join the others.

“I know that look,” Yong said, spitting into the leaves. “Bishop, are you?”

“A learned man,” the woman praised, tone friendly. “I am Bishop Dionne, a servant of the divine.”

“Lovely to meet you,” Lan called out.

A rat to the bone, that one, Tristan fondly thought. She’d shake hands with the King of Hell himself if she thought him a useful relation.

“A sentiment shared,” Bishop Dionne easily replied. “I would have no quarrel between our warbands. We have already suffered losses and abandoned the season of the hunt. Besides, spilling blood will bring the woken god on us all. There are only tears to be had in that.”

Ferranda had come to stand besides Sanale, sword in hand, and she took the lead.

“Then let us all part ways in peace,” Lady Ferranda offered.

“That would be pleasing,” the bishop agreed. “But first I seek of you knowledge of how the woken god was drawn here. We had lost it, mere hours ago. I believe that change is of your doing, yes?”

Hesitation. It was a reasonable thing to ask, but already they could all dimly feel it would not really end at that first request. Perhaps this was, the thief thought, best handled by him. He stepped into the lantern’s light and made a show of sheathing his knife. The hollow warriors made no move to return the courtesy, but it drew the bishop’s approving eye.

“It was a scent,” Tristan told her. “Medicine I carried that also happens to draw the attention of gods. It has all been spent.”

He disliked speaking up, drawing attention to himself like this, but they needed to go and he didn’t trust anyone else to get it done as quickly. Every breath spent here was one less between them and the beast. The priestess smiled pleasantly.

“And how am I to know you speak truth?” she asked. “You might have cursed my warband the same way.”

She wanted something, as he’d thought. She’s mentioned losses earlier so maybe she wanted a prize to compensate for them. Something to bring back home to avoid the perception of complete defeat. Already he was going through his options, finding what he might offer as a bribe, and opened his mouth to –

Yong casually lowered his pistol and shot a hollow.

A scream of pain, followed by more of surprise and anger. Swords and spears rose on the other side, pistols and blades on theirs, but Tristan’s eyes were on the bishop. And when he saw the expression that flickered there, he understood that Yong had not been so reckless after all. Bishop Dionne was not furious, for all that ger face now showed anger. For the barest of heartbeats she had been amused. When Tristan’s eyes moved, he was not surprised to find that Yong had only shot the warrior in the leg.

“You offer insult, stranger,” Dionne said.

“I offer a gift,” Yong replied without batting an eye. “A man you know you will outrun. Let us part on those terms, Bishop, for you will get no more of us.”

The sole man in mail pleaded something to his priest in a guttural language. If Tristan were inclined to bet, he’d say he was asking for permission to fight.

“There is no need for that, Vasil,” Bishop Dionne smiled. “Let us accept this gift in the spirit it was meant. Come here, Alin.”

Grimaces bloomed across the faces of her warriors and the wounded man took a step back, eyes wet with tears.

“No, Bishop,” Alin pleaded, “I swear I would-”

The priest laid a hand on his head, and there was a small stir of wind. The warrior shivered, only for him to straighten his back as she withdrew her fingers.

“I take your pain for an hour, my son,” Dionne said. “You have a chance now: outwit the god, or earn the honour of its teeth.”

They had just cast him out, Tristan thought. The smell of blood was sure to draw the heliodoran beast, so he must be left behind. And part of him felt horror at how easily that life had just been thrown away but the part had been trained, the one that kept him alive all these years, was instead fitting pieces together. The airavatan had slain trial-takers and cultists both the day before the Bluebell docked, but there had been no trace of them impaled inside its maw when he saw inside yesterday. They are only kept there until death, he decided. How long did it take a man to die from impalement? There was no telling, unless you knew where they got impaled, and that was impossible to predict. But the odds were still worth it. Bishop Dionne flicked a glance their way.

“Let us part ways in peace, as was offered,” she said, an ironic lilt to the offer.

“No,” Tristan said, and stepped forward.

“What are you-”

Someone silenced Felis as the thief took his cabinet off his back, opening it up. He took out two vials, then a rag to go with them. He only had two clean ones left, at this rate he’d run out.

“What are your intentions, child?” the bishop asked.

“I am a physician,” Tristan lied. “I have taken oath to help those who suffer, even darklings. Let me treat his wound.”

Dionne looked taken aback. The hollow she had already good as cast out turned a pleading look on her, so she ended up nodding her head with open bemusement.

“You may proceed.”

“Sit down,” Tristan ordered the man.

Drenching the rag in alcohol, he cleaned the wound and explained to ‘Alin’ that he could not risk taking out the lead ball inside his leg lest he be at risk of bleeding out. Instead he cleaned the burns and wrapped the wounds with the last of his bandages before offering the man vial to drink.

“It will kill the pain for half a day,” he said. “It will also taste foul, but drink the whole thing anyway.”

The hollow gratefully nodded and downed it, almost retching at the taste. He handed back the vial and Tristan rose to his feet before helping him up.

“It is all I can do,” the thief said. “I can only wish you good luck.”

“You have done much already,” Alin, his Antigua faintly guttural. “My blessings go with you, son of the Radiance.”

Now there was something to trouble a man’s sleep. Tristan smiled back anyway. Bishop Dionne approached, giving a weighing look, and leaned close.

“I thank you for the kindness, child,” she said. “It is almost a shame that you are all already dead.”

Somehow he suspected she had not become a bishop because of her bedside manner, but that was fine. He had not done a kindness at all. Their groups parted ways with fewer glares than there had been a moment ago, though no one from either side had loosened their grip on their weapon. The last Tristan saw of them was the wounded warrior being encircled by the others, a chant beginning on the priest’s lips, and then they were hurrying away. Not long after they were out of sight he was pulled to the fore.

“Why did we just waste time watching you pretend to help that darkling?” Yong bluntly asked.

“Pretend?” Ferranda said, surprised.

“He is out of painkillers,” Sarai told her. “What did you actually make him drink, Tristan?”

“Volcian yew,” the thief said. “My entire stock.”

Sanale let out a hard bark of laughter.

“A poison?” Yong frowned.

“Only for spirits,” the Malani grinned. “Clever man.”

“The airavatan is going to be eating our friend soon enough,” Tristan said. “And when it does, it will also be eating a bellyful of poison.”

The heliodoran beast ate the corpses it impaled inside its own maw. It must, for there had been no trace of the first wave of trial-takers there when he had seen inside the mouth yesterday. The thief suspected that they were kept impaled so long as they lived to suffer and were consumed when dead. That was his bet: that the hollow would die quick enough inside the maw for the poison in him to matter.

Now all that was left was to run and hope the roll of the dice went their way.

# Chapter 18

Tristan couldn’t quite believe it when they broke the treeline.

“It’s the right place,” Sarai fervently told him. “The hills are in the right arrangement.”

She had to be right, she was no fool and she had the map tucked away inside her mind through a Sign, and yet the thief felt no relief. Before them a great clearing in the forest was stretching out, rolling hills and a stretch of gleaming grass. Miles of open land, with trees on all sides save the north – where the ravine lay, and the bridge to cross it. Tristan spat to the side, for his mouth taste of iron after all the running, and looked behind. The others were catching up, the fit and the not. The former clustered together, keeping the same exhausted but unrelenting pace, while the latter trailed behind.

Yong, Sanale, Ferranda, Lan. All these were mere moments behind he and Sarai.

It was they others they waited for until they came out one by one. It took nearly ten minutes: Vanesa had not got quicker for the evening’s exertions and Francho was barely ahead of her. As for Felis, it had been only a matter of time until his lick of dust’s feverish burst of energy passed – and once it had, he’d become a shambles. That Aines stayed with him was as much a result of her poor shape as loyalty to her hanging rope of a marriage, Tristan suspected. She was barely faster on her feet than the greyhairs now, evidently not used to lasting exercise. And yet they were catching up, all of them.

They had all made it.

“I thought we’d lose at least one of the elders,” Yong admitted. “It is a bruising pace we have kept.”

“Tough,” Sanale appreciatively said.

“Desperations is a kind of strength,” Lan said. “And even the old girl wants to live, deep down.”

The thief caught her eye and dipped his head in agreement. Vanesa had not given up. She might not expect to live through this, but neither was she ready to lay down and die. It was worthy of respect, as much as the freely gifted kindness. As the laggards entered the light of the lantern, Tristan saw how worn down they had become. Expectedly so: it had been punishing work moving through the woods even with their lanterns now wide open.

They had followed the edge of the ravine to avoid getting lost, following it east until the treeline broke. They’d passed to more rings of raised stones as they did – one intact, the other shattered – and the second they had passed not even a half hour ago. Whatever they might once have been used for, they now made for useful landmarks. When the last of them, a sweaty and dishevelled Vanesa, caught up the lot of them shared a brief rest.

“We’re close, then?” Felis raggedly asked.

Sarai pointed slightly to the northwest, past two high hills.

“The bridge is there,” she said. “There can be no doubt.”

Far be it from him to argue with the woman who had a used magic to memorize the map. Even the most exhausted of them picked up the pace at her words, elation and relief limbering slowing feet. Even Tristan found a smile tugging at his lips. It seemed they had reached salvation before the monster caught up with them, after all. He crested a hill, then another, and saw the dirt path laid down before him. Then the relief caught in his throat.

Lemures.

Lupines, a whole pack of them. Though Aines and Yong were standing at his side within moments, not a single of the beasts glanced their way: they were too busy tearing hungrily into corpses. Slowly coming down the hill, hand on his knife, he took a closer look at the bodies. Hollows, Tristan recognized. Less than half a day dead, and as the light of the lantern reached the bridge beyond the lupines he remembered the bishop’s smiling curse: you are all already dead.

The corpses being eaten had been crushed and stomped, as if by a great beast.

These were, he realized, the losses Bishop Dionne had talked about. The priestess herself might have been here mere hours ago. One after another, he fit the pieces together. Standing there alone with closed eyes, he painted the picture the way Abuela had taught him to.

By the time the Bluebell had come ashore, the cultists had already been stirred up from the debacle that woke up the airavatan. The warbands split, some roving the land while the largest claimed the western and eastern bridge. The morning after Ju was murdered the trial-takers split into bands of their own, but their story was not Tristan’s trouble: what he cared for was the bridges. After Inyoni and her fellows fought their way through the western bridge, the airavatan went mad from whatever had confused it and collapsed the bridge. What, then, were the hollows to do?

Everyone headed east. So, eventually, did the airavatan.

The monster slew a few warbands and some went into hiding, but what Tristan and the others had deduced when they first laid their plans was still true: the cultists did not help each other, they were rivals. And so no one went to warn the large warband holding the eastern bridge – led, he now believed, by Bishop Dionne – that a monster was on the prowl. The cultists were taken entirely by surprise when it attacked them.

That warband had been hit tonight, mere hours ago. It was why the tracks Sanale had found earlier were fresh: the cultists been fleeing the beast by going east into the woods, away from this deadly clearing. After finishing up here, the airvatan had followed in their direction but been lost – perhaps because of the rain, which would dampen how it smelled. It had still moved east somewhat, though, and been close enough to immediately smell the lodestone extract when Tristan used it.

Which brought them to here and now: the cultist camp of a rival warband destroyed, their own crew running for the bridge before the heliodoran beast turned on them.

And now they came to the reason Bishop Dionne had called them dead. Tristan opened his eyes as the light of the lantern carried by Yong passed the corpses and lupines. To the bridge, through which some cultists had tried to flee and where the monster caught up to them. And when it struck them down, in its rage it must have collapsed the wooden bridge: now only shattered edges on both side of the ravine remained, the rest long fallen into the river below. There would be no crossing here.

They were stuck on this side, with the beast and the hollows.

“No,” Aines shouted.

The lupines did not even care enough about the noise to abandon their meal. Despair trembled in the air, not one of them denying its sting. It was too long for a jump across, Tristan thought. And they did not have a rope long enough to attempt another kind of crossing. Even Sarai’s face fell, though she was the first to gather herself.

“If we go west, the river grows wider and stronger but there is no ravine,” she said. “Swimming through there is the only way left.”

Half of them wouldn’t make that swim, the thief thought. Neither of the elders, probably not Aines either and he was not so sure of Lan. Gods, he was not so sure of himself. He was fit but no great swimmer and the Watch had built bridges on the island for a reason. But it was all that remained, so he put away his doubts and breathed in. He let out his breath and his fear with it.

“Let’s go,” he said. “No time to waste.”

If they waited for too long their company was sure to fall into arguments and backbiting, which would eat into their chances of losing the airavatan. So he began setting out, nudging Sarai to do the same. She gave him a long look, then nodded and followed. Behind them he heard Felis comfort his wife and yell something out at Yong, but Tristan met the Tianxi’s eyes and the soldier snorted. Ignoring Felis, he joined them in walking away. After that, the simple pressure of people leaving forced the rest to make a decision: stay or follow.

Enough followed that the rest feared to stay.

It was not a solid foundation, the thief knew, but the worst had happened and so he must adjust his expectations. There could be no more sentimentality. Ferranda sought him out at the front, having surprised him when she and Sanale stuck with them.

“You have a scheme in mind,” she said. “What is it?”

“Going west,” he flatly replied. “If we live through the day then we can revisit how we will cross.”

She grimaced.

“Fair enough,” Ferranda replied. “We will stay with you for now, but make no promises for tomorrow.”

He shrugged. The pair were far from dead weight, and he’d given due thought to Sanale’s offer, but trackers were no longer needed. It would be hard to get lost now that they had found the river: all that remained was to find a way to cross it. It had earlier taken most of an hour for them to get to the bridge, and now they squeezed out much the same hurrying through the hills. In a few miles west the woods would begin again, continuing until they broke for another plain at the heart of the island where the other bridge lay.

Past that, at least a full day west, was where Sarai was suggesting they attempt the crossing.

Only when they were out of breath did they call their first halt. The pretence that they were all in this together had worn thin: both the greyhairs had been lagging behind again, the same for Aines and Felis, and no one moved to help them. They would catch up exhausted to the remainder of the group only by the time it set out, the thief estimated, and so be forced to continue without rest. It was a slow death sentence, but Tristan hardened his heart.

He no longer had the luxury of caring about anything but survival.

“Huh,” Yong said. “Unusual.”

Panting and on his knees, Tristan turned to follow the Tianxi’s gaze. Further along the ravine – it was wider here, likely why the bridge had been built further east – there were rings of raised stones. Two of them, rather close, and in near perfect state. Whoever the builders had been, they had made them to last. It was not long after this second ring the forest began again, the clearing come to an end. After entering those woods it ought to take at least half a day until they found open grounds again, which he did not look forward to.

It was vicious kind of irony that Tristan and his fellows were to see twice as many bridges anyone from the Bluebell yet all of them would be broken.

And now remembering, the other bridge’s fate – which he had known of for an entire day! – he cursed himself for not having considered the same might happen again. It was plain that the blackcloacks had not built bridges strong enough to withstand the lemure, that they had expected the airavatan to remain sleeping. He’d had the right knowledge in his pocket all along and never thought to put it to use.

“The others were further apart,” Yong breathed out.

The thief blinked for a moment before realizing Yong was still talking of the stone circles.

“Maybe we’re near the middle,” Tristan shrugged.

Francho believed they followed the length of the river, from east to west, but he might have been wrong. The thief got back on his feet, meeting the Yong’s eyes. A nod was shared and they began to move again – setting out at a pace that was not quite a run but far from walking. This was to be a trial of endurance, not a quick race.  

Tristan forced himself not to think about the fact that Francho and Vanesa had not yet caught up.

Half an hour later they were slightly past the second of the rings, not even a quarter hour away from the woods resuming to the west. The thief slowed for a heartbeat, convinced he’d seen a light inside the stones, but it was nothing: only a stone smoothed by rain reflecting the stars, however. He breathed out, not sure whether he was relieved or disappointed.  The answer was soon settled, however, as the little he had turned was enough for him to catch sight of something that froze his limbs.

Behind them, to the east, mist was billowing past the crest of the hills

His breath caught. If the mist was close enough for him to see without even lantern light, then there was no outrunning the monster. The heliodoran beast had caught up, and what could the likes of them do against such a creature? He was going to die here in the dark, surrounded by strangers. He- Tristan breathed in, breathed out. Remember your lessons. What he could not do did not matter, so what could he do? If the monster could not be fled from, it must be tricked.

“Tristan,” Sarai called out, but then she turned to follow his gaze and her voice went out like a candle in the wind.

The thief did not answer, eyes staying fixed on the heliodoran beast. In the distance he could see the white fog slowly but surely gaining on Vanesa, ever the last of them. She had yet to notice. Sarai pulled at his arm, fingers squeezing hard at his flesh.

“We need to go,” she hissed. “I know you-”

“You’re letting fear do your thinking for you,” Tristan said, tone even. “We had at least an hour on it, running on open grounds while it was in the woods. We cannot flee from it, Sarai: we’re simply not fast enough.”

He straightened his back.

“As our good friend the bishop said, we must outwit the god or earn the honour of its teeth.”

Sarai loudly swallowed.

“You said to stick close to you, if this went bad,” she said.

“I can perhaps keep us alive, and another as well,” he admitted. “But I am not sure how long.”

It would be a gamble. While they were covered in magic feathers reeking of sleep the beast should not eat them, but they would be unconscious and he would have to hope the lemure kept chasing the others instead of taking the time to stomp them out of spite. By the way her breathing grew uneven, Sarai was panicking. He did not blame her.

“You’ve just good as said we’re going to die – how are you so fucking calm?” she demanded.

Did he seem that way? He did not feel it. There was a wild animal clawing at his insides, even if it had yet to break the cage.

“I am terrified,” Tristan honestly told her. “My limbs are trembling and my mind is mush. But it doesn’t matter, because I know where we are.”

“Where?” she snarled.

“In a grave,” the rat grinned. “We have nothing left to lose, Sarai: either we buy our way out or we stay buried. Fear only matters if it can still get worse.”

She let out a hiccup that was half indignation and half laughter.

“Gods,” she croaked. “No wonder the masks want you.”

Masks – did she mean the Krypteia? No, now was not the time. There would be time to ask what one of the Circles of the Watch might want with him if they lived. Instead he clapped her shoulder comfortingly and his eyes went back to their coming doom. By his count Vanesa was a quarter hour behind them, to the east, and the beast would catch up to her around the time she reached the first ring of stones. Indeed, now that the mist was spreading further across the wet grass he could make out the airvatan’s silhouette in starlight. The monster was following her doggedly.

Vanesa had noticed the monster at last and broken into a run that slowly curved north towards the ravine – her eye again, Tristan thought with a sliver of grief – and the beast had followed the adjustment exactly. Almost, he frowned, too exactly.

“Sarai,” he said, “is it me or is the airavatan running strangely?”

Afraid or not, the blue-eyed woman had not fallen to pieces. They stood there in silence for a long moment, gaze following the same great beast.

“It’s not moving across the hills well,” she murmured. “It keeps almost tripping on the slopes. Why?”

“It’s blind,” Tristan breathed out, excitement rising. “It wasn’t enough poison to kill it, but it went blind.”

He suspected the beast have been blind when it began following them across the plains – surely it would not have been able to hear them from so far away – but now the volcian yew had taken its sight. It could still get around somehow, and track them, but the way it kept walking on things instead of over them was telling.

“It’s still following Vanesa,” Sarai said. “The impact of feet on the ground? No, then it would feel the slopes and the stones when its footsteps make them shake. It must be the sound, it is listening to her run.”

“Then hiding would be pointless,” Tristan noted. “If it can hear her from that far away, there is no way to hold our breath for long enough it won’t hear us.”

“We need protection,” she said. “Something to hide behind. We could try going down the side of the ravine?”

Tristan grimaced, shaking his head, and even Sarai looked unconvinced. The beast would be able to reach them with its tentacles. Gods, the monstrosity was longer than the ravine was large. But there was one detail that he’d had in the back of his mind since earlier, an oddity about how the monster had attacked the cultist camp.

“I think I have something,” Tristan admitted. “But there will be no way to tell if it works until it’s on us.”

Blue eyes met his and she hesitated. He was, in practice, asking her to bet her life on his hunch. They had known each other for mere days, and spent much of these hiding secrets from one another and – her expression hardened and she offered her arm. She had, he sensed, come to a decision. Not just about the needs of the moment, but deeper things still. Gently, almost reverently, he clasped the proffered arm.

“Maryam,” she said. “My name is Maryam Khaimov. If I am to trust you with my life, I should trust you with that.”

He swallowed.

“Tristan Abrascal,” he said, lips gone dry.

It was the first time he’d said his surname in years and he shivered at hearing it.

“Let’s live, Tristan,” Maryam smiled. “After that, it would be embarrassing not to.”

He grinned back, minutes away from death and terrified and somehow more alive than he’d been since he was a boy.

—

They went back to the first ring of stones. This was madness, so naturally even after the others noticed they were no longer running and turned back to ask few were inclined to follow.

“This is madness,” Ferranda Villazur flatly informed him.

As always, the infanzona caught on quickly.

“I am aware,” Tristan said. “It might, however, be the useful kind of madness.”

The fair-haired noblewoman studied him for a moment, then shook her head. Her plain face was drawn with exhaustion, but her expression remained steadfast in a stolid sort of way.

“I wish you well, but I will not risk my life so recklessly,” Ferranda told. “We part ways here.”

Or so she said, but then she glanced at Sanale – who nodded after a heartbeat. Reassured, her face firmed. Their decision was made.

“Good luck,” Tristan said, and was surprised to find her meant the words.

“You too,” Sanale said, offering his hand. “Keep your knife close. Better to die quick if can.”

It was said with such friendly concern that the thief could not even find it in himself to be offended at the presumption they were all about to die, shaking it. They were not truly friends, though perhaps in time they could have become something close to it, but the pair had been more than tolerable to work with. It was already better than he had ever expected to think of an infanzona. When Lady Ferranda offered her hand he shook it as well. The two hurried away after rushing through goodbyes, heading west for the woods. Lan followed behind them, offering only a cheerful wave before legging it.

The three had lost some time doubling back, but likely expected to make it back while the airavatan murdered everyone staying behind.

Yong watched them go, then grimaced.

“Now would be a good time to tell me you put some lodestone in their bags,” the Tianxi said.

“Alas, I used the full stock,” Tristan easily replied.

“I was afraid you’d stay that,” Yong sighed. “Is the plan really to hide inside the stone rings and pray they keep the monster out?”

“I don’t intend to pray,” Sarai informed him.

He glared at her.

“You two are a bad influence on each other,” he said, then turned to spit on the grass.

He sighed and began to load his musket.

“I think this might be the most idiotic plan I’ve ever followed,” Yong said, “and I’ve served with militia officers from Mazu.”

Tristan cocked an eyebrow. He knew little of that republic save that it was one of the foremost naval powers of the Trebian Sea.

“Half their promotion examination is about poetry,” Yong scathingly said.

“What I choose to take from this is that my insight matched that of trained military officers,” Tristan proudly replied. “Come on, let’s go hide in the rings.”

Their company had spread out. Ferranda and Sanale had pulled ahead to the west and were minutes away from the woods, a surprisingly quick Lan a notch behind them, while further back Aines and Felis were getting close to the first ring of stones. A few minutes behind them Francho was limping, and even further beyond that Vanesa struggled to catch up. Tristan worried his lip, evaluating the distances. He had the time, narrowly.

“We have two lanterns,” he said. “Let us put one in each ring.”

It was as clear a signal he could risk considering that shouting would likely attract the beast. Seeing a lantern in the eastern ring might induce the others to try going inside it.

“Soft touch,” Yong chided, but it was without heat.

The Tianxi stayed in the second ring while he and Sarai brought a lantern to the first, running back when they saw how close the airavatan was getting. They left just as Aines and Felis arrived, the pair looking baffled as the entered the ring. Even from there they could see Yong waiting in the other, his silhouette clear in the other lantern’s light, so though the wedded pair shouted questions that Tristan did not turn to answer they stayed inside in mimicry of the Tianxi. The surprise was that, by the time they got back to the western ring, Lan was running towards it as well. When she stumbled past the circle of raised stones, falling on her knees in the grass, she gave them a blue grin.

“Decided to bet on you this time,” Lan explained.

It was just as likely she had realized she was not as physically fit as the pair in front of her and was likely to get eaten while they kept running, but Tristan decided not to be unpleasant. It was not impossible they were all about to die. Instead he went for the edge of their circle of stones, leaning against the tall stone and watching as the airavatan closed the last of the distance to the eastern ring. Francho had made it inside, falling to his hands and knees before the other two as they held each other, and that left there was only Vanesa. She went straight for the ring, as quick as she could, while behind her mist followed. Make it, Tristan encouraged. Come on, you can make it.

Mist spread past her and the shadow loomed tall, the ground shaking silently beneath its feet, but she was there. Fingers biting into the palm of his hand until they bled, Tristan watched as the old woman got three feet away from the edge of the ring – and slipped.

“No,” he breathed out.

She fell, face forward, and a third of her body made it into the ring. The airavatan’s leg, tall and large as pillar, rose and came down – but Felis, in a burst of courage, left his wife and caught Vanesa’s arm. He dragged her forward.

It was not enough.

Vanesa screamed, one of her legs snapping like a twig. But she lived. Felis had pulled quickly enough that it had been a leg instead of her body up to the ribcage, and as the airavatan stomped furiously around the ring of raised stones the dust fiend finished dragging her inside. And though he’d just seen a woman’s leg become a ruin of bone and broken flesh, Tristan eyes widened in elation at what he saw: the beasts’ mist did not enter the ring of stones. It refused to, that was the reason they had been able to hear Vanesa scream at all. Yong cursed softly in Cathayan as the heliodoran beast’s tentacles felt out the stones, trying to reach through them but sliding as if against glass.

It had done the same thing, back at the cultist camp, but the ring there had been broken.

“You were right, you little madman,” Yong said. “You were fucking right.”

Sarai – Maryam, though he did not yet think of her that way – found his hand and squeezed it. He squeezed back.

“My wisdom is being followed as well,” Lan smugly said. “Just look at them run.”

He followed her gaze, finding that Ferranda and Sanale were doubling back. They must have seen the rings truly were a protection, and realized their safety was the best chance for them to live through the nigh. The situation had changed the moment the monster was kept at bay by the stones: now the airavatan might well abandon the prey beyond its reach for easier kills, and the pair were the only two on the table. Yet their earlier advantage, how quickly they had run, was now turning against them. They were too far.

With rising horror, Tristan turned to see the airavatan striding away from the other ring: it had heard them doubling back.

The coolness in the back of his mind, the part that had been trained, measured the spans and the speeds. The airavatan, rushing from west to east. The pair, rushing from east to west. Ferranda and Sanale were closer to the eastern ring than the airavatan was, but the beast moved almost twice as quickly and would not tire. It was a done deal and it became terribly obvious within a minute of the ugly race beginning that the pair would not get there in time. The truth of that sunk in them like rain, soaking them to the bone.

Sarai closed her eyes in grief. Lan smiled in poorly hid relief at how close she had cut it. Yong clenched his teeth and strode to the edge of the ring to shoot his musket at the airavatan, which had gotten close enough for it. The lemure turned one of its eyeless heads their way, but otherwise ignored them. The Tianxi might as well have shot at a fortress wall. The lovers saw it as well, though the realization hit them in waves. First fear spurred them to drop their lantern and all their bags and save one, sprinting as fast as they could.

It was a straight line east to the ring, for them, but already the beast was of a height with it. It would be standing between them and safety within moments.

Tristan watched as fear was replaced by despair, by anger. Ferranda slowed, taking out something from their last bag and trying to strike a match. She failed, even after trying thrice. The mist kept killing the flame. Sanale had stayed with her, and now their fate was plain: the airavatan was between them and the stone ring. Yong shot at the monster’s back again, but it didn’t even twitch. The lovers’ stride faltered, for a moment, and then Sanale said something before pressing a soft kiss against the side of Ferranda’s neck. Before the infanzona could finish turning to see his face, the Malani swerved away.

South, away from the ring, and screaming at the top of his lungs in Umoya.

Both the beast and the woman hesitated for half a heartbeat. Face ashen, eyes tearing up, Ferranda Villazur resumed sprinting for the ring. It was out of her hands now, she must know that all she could do was try not to waste his sacrifice. And the airavatan, well, it did what all hungry and spiteful lemures did when denied getting everything they wanted: it went to vent its anger on the most insolent of the prey, the Malani provoking it. Tristan did not remember walking to the edge of the ring or taking out his knife, or his fingers closing around the cithara in his bag.

And as he watched Ferranda Villazur approach salvation, he saw how Sanale had not yet abandoned the thought of survival. He’d taunted the lemure, got it to head further away from the ring, but now he had cut a sharp turn and was printing for it himself. The airavatan was too close. Tall legs swallowed the distance, unerring on the grass, and though the Malani was swift as cat he was so much smaller.

“Please,” Ferranda Villazur shouted, not even yet in the ring. “Please, if you can do anything, I beg you-”

Tristan looked away.  Fortuna was leaning against the stone opposite his, eyes unreadable. Flicking a wrist, she twirled a coin between her fingers. Unearthly in the thin starlight, a slice of blood and gold cutting into the grey and green of the Dominion. His bet to make, she did not need to say. It always was.

“Fuck,” the thief cursed.

It was foolish, it was going to get himself killed and he wasn’t even going to get anything out of it. He ripped the cithara out of his bag, smashing the pommel of his knife into the belly. It cracked and he hit it again, twice more until it was open and a single lucent blue feather came drifting out. Dropping the knife, he ran out of the ring. Mist was lapping at the bottom of the stones and he hurried through, finding it thick as smoke but easy to breathe in. Grabbing the edge of the cithara, he inclined it so the feathers wouldn’t spill out and silently screamed his terror into the stillness.

Ten strides, twenty, and the airavatan’s long legs caught up to Sanale: the ground trembled and the sure-footed huntsman tripped. It was now or never, Tristan knew, and he threw the cithara. He hesitated, for the barest of moments, to pull on his contract. But the price… when the stakes were so high, only certain death moved him to use it. So he only threw.

The moment he did, he knew he had failed.

The arc was too short. He could still… But he did not, for in the end Tristan was yet a rat. It would surely get him killed, so instead of pulling at the power inside him he watched as the cithara flew up only to drop half a dozen feet short of Sanale just as he was grabbed by heliodoran beast. Tristan turned without stopping to look at what would follow.

The silence was a mercy.

Heart thundering in his ears, the thief felt the ground shake behind him and the beast gain ground. He’d gone too far, or he’d not gone far enough, but whatever the truth of it Tristan knew in his bones that he was going to die. The lantern trembled ahead of him, inside the ring, carving out the silhouettes of the others. One came closer than the rest. Sarai? No, too tall.

“Roll,” Fortuna hissed.

He obeyed without hesitation, feeling a tentacle grab behind him. He rose into a run as the airavatan struck at the ground in anger. In front of him the silhouette grabbed at something he could not make out. A match cracked, the heartbeat of light revealing red-eyed Ferranda, and she lit something in her hands. The ground shook behind him and Tristan almost tripped, stumbling into a sharp turn to the left instead, but the game was up. He’d slowed, the beast had him.

“You need to-” Fortuna began, but he never heard the rest.

Something went flying above his head, something Ferranda Villazur had thrown, and after a heartbeat instead of death Tristan felt heat licking at his back. There was a detonation and burst of light as he ran, ran as fast as he could – and he heard the airavatan scream in pain even through the lemure’s own mist. He threw himself in the grass past the ring of stones, landing painfully on his arms but too wildly relieved to care. Behind him the world shook, the beast furiously stamping the ground around the raised stones.

But he’d gotten through, gods. By the skin of his teeth but he still lived. Rolling his belly up, panting, he found the infanzona’s eyes.

“Thank you,” he got out.

Her lips thinned.

“You tried,” Ferranda simply said, and looked away.

He had no answer to that, and so instead he dropped his head back in the grass and waited for his limbs to cease shaking. When they did, Sarai was there to help him up while he caught the tail of talk between the others.

“-was that?”

“Zhentianlei,” Yong said. “A grenade. Though one filled with more than powder.”

“Phosphorescent salts,” Ferranda quietly said. “It is a Malani trick.”

Tristan would have shared in the sliver of the grief he saw in those eyes, had he the time. Knowing he owed his life in part to the man he’d failed to save was a humbling thing. But sentiment would have to wait, for the beast lingered. This was the part where planning stumbled, for how could he know what the monster would do?

The answer, it turned out, was throw a tantrum.

It stalked around in the silence of its mist, smashing at the ground and trying to wriggles its tentacles around the protection of the stones. The ancient work did not fail, but the heliodoran beast did not tire: what Tristan thought might be it leaving ended up being the creature heading back to the other ring. It kept venting its fury there, terrifying the four inside clustering around their trembling lantern light.

“We have food and water enough for two days,” Yong said.

“No cultists will get anywhere near us while it’s here, there is that,” Sarai sighed. “But if it does not leave we may well be stuck here until we starve.”

“It may fake leaving,” Lan said. “It’s what I’d do: let us get far enough from the rings, then attack.”

Lady Ferranda took no place in the talks, out of what the thief thought to be grief, but he had underestimated her: she was crouching by the edge of the ring, staring at something. He joined her there, following her gaze. The grass had split a dozen feet away from them. His heart clenched at the sight.

“It could be only the one crack,” he quietly said.

“The cultist camp was about this far from the ravine, when part of the cliff came down in the storm,” the infanzona evenly replied. “And that was the work of wind and water, not a giant stampeding around.”

Much as he wanted to deny her, Tristan could not. She was right: if the airavatan kept stomping about, the slice of the cliff on which their ring stood was at risk of collapse. They were too close to the edge and it seemed that erosion had dug under their feet. Was the eastern ring also at risk? Doesn’t matter, Tristan chided himself. There’s no way for us to move there while it’s prowling the grass.

It seemed they did not have two days after all, but instead hours – or less, if they were unlucky. Tristan rose and walked away, leaving to Ferranda the unpleasant task of breaking the news to the others even. It was unkind, when she was in fresh grief, but he could not bring himself to care. Instead he went to the northern edge of the ring, the one overlooking the ravine. He could not make out the water at the bottom, it was too deep for that, but he could hear it.

It was not the depth but the length that’d kill them:  the ravine just long enough that neither jump nor rope would work, though he thought that if the heliodoran beast took a long enough run-up it might make it across.

Staring at the dark below, he found himself empty of ideas. Part of him still believed that given long enough their company would figure out a way to get across, but what did that matter when the beast would send them tumbling down long before that? It needed to be- exclamations of surprise from the others drew his eye. The beast had been striking at the bottom of the raised stones of the other ring and some piece of rubble come loose: the airavatan charged it without missing a beat, furiously attacking the ground until the shard was nothing but powder. It turned back to besieging the ring after, which mercifully held even missing a piece.

For now.

The thief worried his lip. Had it been this aggressive before? He thought not. It had liked the fear, to make them run and cower. Now it struck to kill from the start.

“Yong,” he said. “I need you to do something for me.”

The Tianxi cocked an eyebrow but let himself be drawn into the scheme. It was a simple thing, after all, the testing of a guess. The former soldiers loaded his musket, aimed and fired at the ground to the east – as close as he could to the heliodoran beast while keeping a strong impact. The monster turned immediately, abandoning the other ring to charge at where the ground was shot and stomp the spot thoroughly. It’s not thinking anymore, Tristan decided. That grenade angered it beyond reason. That was… it was a fool’s notion, but what else was left save the likes of these?

He took Sarai – Maryam – aside.

“What can you do with Signs?” he quietly asked.

She grimaced.

“I know nine but have mastered only three,” she admitted. “All of them Autarchics.”

His confusion must have been plain, for she elaborated without prompting.

“Contained within my own mind,” Sarai said. “The Sign I used to keep the map within me, for example.”

“You made an orb of darkness when we encountered the gravebird,” he said. “To keep Vanesa from being swept by the river.”

“It is a Sign I learned,” she warily agreed. “But it is demanding and I cannot maintain it for long. The consequences would be… unpleasant.”

He acknowledged that with a nod, but pressed on.

“Does it need to be anchored on something like water, or can it hang in the air?”

“It needs no anchor,” she replied. “It is an exercise of shaping raw Gloam. Tristan, what are you scheming?”

“Maybe nothing,” he admitted. “Maybe something. It depends on how long you can maintain it.”

She searched his eyes for something. Whatever it was, she found it.

“How long do you need?”

—

If it were not plain to everyone by now that they would not survive another hour of the airavatan stomping around their ring, Tristan figured some of them might have called him a fool. The same people likely thought him one in private still, but with death looming so tall at the end of their common road none were willing to spit on even a fool’s chance of living through this. Yong caught his shoulder as he prepared to go. He hesitated, breath now smelling of drink in a way that was impossible to mistake even if Tristan had not seen him sneak a lick from his flask.

“Good luck,” the Tianxi finally said.

“And you,” Tristan replied, and on a whim pressed his hat into the man’s hands.

Hopefully he would be coming back for it. If not, well, why waste a perfectly good hat?

Swallowing his fear, the remembrance of the monsters’ tentacles coming within breaths of seizing him, the thief stepped out of the ring. He did not even need to shout: within two heartbeats the airavatan stopped tormenting the other stone ring and turned west. The difficult part, Tristan had known from the start, would be getting the angle right.

There were fixed points and objects in movement.

A ring to the east, from which the airavatan was coming as he headed west: towards the other ring, and Tristan who had just stepped out of it. To their north the ravine, to their south miles of grass and hills until distant woods were reached.

Tristan headed south, away from the ravine and onto the grass. The airavatan charged, eager for violence. Heat pounding in his throat, Tristan fought down the primal urge to run back to the safety of the ring and continued moving south as the creature approached. It was angling away from the ravine and straight towards him, charging blindly as it had for the stone and shot. Breathing ragged, Tristan waited as long as he dared before breaking into a run. Back north towards the ravine, not so far from the same ring he’d come from.

The moving parts he had sketched out in his mind came to be, one terrifying heartbeat at a time. Himself, nearing the edge of the ravine to the north – when he did, the ring where the others waited would be directly to his side to the west. Sarai would be there, his death or salvation. The heliodoran beast, on the other hand, took the angle he’d led it into. By going south he’d drawn it southwest across the span between the rings, and now to catch up to him as he ran north it was turning northwest. Adjusting its angle he got closer and closer to the edge of the ravine.

He’d begun running too early out of fear, he realized, so he had to fight down his instincts and slow his steps as the mist billowed past his feet and the beast approached. He felt the ground shiver beneath his feet and hurried, the airavatan charging after him. It was only mere feet between him and the ravine now. Thirty, twenty, ten.

“It’s close,” Fortuna whispered into his ear. “Behind you, to the right.”

There was only one way to live now that he’d got his far: trusting Sarai. And so, screaming into the silence at the top of his lungs, Tristan leapt off the edge of the cliff.

For a hideous moment he flew, until just ahead of him an orb of darkness formed and he smacked right into its surface. Scrabbling desperately against the Gloam – it was neither rough nor smooth, but his weight had him slipping the surface nonetheless – he balled up around the orb and hoped. It was the best he could do, too afraid to try to turn and look back, but he still made himself see it in his mind’s eye.

The airavatan was blinded, by both poison and rage, and it was a massive creature on the run. It had been but a heartbeat or two behind him, much too late to turn. Which meant…

The mist might have covered the grass and smothered sound there, but when the airavatan tumbled past the edge of the ravine he heard it scrabbling against stone. Thunderous bellows erupted from its maw as it slipped, desperately struggling, and a frenzied laugh escaped his throat. He’d done it. The fucking monster had heard him going north as he leapt and tried to intercept him right into ravine, which it could not see any more than it had seen the hill slopes. The orb of Gloam shivered beneath him and the thief let out a yelp.

Now he needed to get out of here before Sarai was forced to release the Sign.

Limbs shaking, he slowly began to wiggle around the orb so he could face the cliff. Every movement sent a thrill of terror up his wrists, the distant roar of the river beneath a reminder of what would happen to him if he slipped. When he finally turned to face the others he saw they had prepared as he’d asked. Yong had tied his wrists to his musket, extending it as a perch, and the others – save Sarai – were holding on to him. Beneath him the orb wobbled again. The more he let himself think about it, Tristan knew, the deeper the fear would bite.

So instead he crawled atop the orb, standing in a crouch as his teeth bit into his lips, and with what little footing he could muster he leapt back towards the cliff.

The butt of the musket caught him in the eye. He shouted in pain and terror, his cursed sweating hands slipping against the weapon, but his fingers caught on the lock. The piece of flint cut into his flesh but he held on for dear life, Yong and the others shouting as they hoisted him up. Only it wasn’t enough, his grip was too weak, and he half-sobbed as the musket slid through his fingers.

He pulled at his luck.

The ticking began but for a searing moment nothing at all happened – until he realized that above him Maryam has slipped on the grass, falling down: belly on the ground, but her torso hanging past the edge of the cliff. Line of sight, he thought, a second before she let out shout and something solid formed beneath his feet, catching his fall. Another orb. It immediately began breaking apart, but the brief moment had been enough for Yong to grab him by the collar. With a heave the former soldier hoisted him up, enough that the others caught him too and he was dragged over the edge. They dropped him face down in the grass and Tristan almost wept.

He’d bought his way out of the grave again.

He stayed lying there, panting and listening to his heartbeat slow. Clenching his teeth in anticipation, he released the luck he’d borrowed.

“Shit,” Sarai said, “Tristan you-”

The thief wriggled like a worm, for his feet were on fire. Or so it felt like: when he looked strands if Gloam were eating away at his right boot through the bottom. He tried to get it off but the pain was… Yong tackled him, ripping it off, and once the leather was away from his skin the burning stopped. Tristan pulled the sole of his feet close after Yong released him, finding the skin was red and raw, already blistering. Gods, that was going to hurt. Still better than falling to his death. He waved away Sarai’s apology, something about losing control of the Sign, and let himself fall into the grass again.

Someone set something down on his belly, and he reached to find it was his tricorn. Grabbing it, he fanned his face and found Yong smiling down at him.

“Lan’s going to get the other four,” he said. “We can all set out together.”

It was the only way Vanesa would get anywhere, now. Her leg was a ruin.

“The beast?” he asked.

“See for yourself,” Yong replied, offering a hand.

Tristan took it, rising to finally take a good look at his handiwork. He half-hopped on one foot, leaning against Yong. He’d been right, the thief thought when they got close: the  airavatan might have made the jump, with long enough a run-up. It must have still gotten close, because it was hanging to the other side of the ravine by its heads and tentacles. Its back legs propped it up against their side of the ravine as it writhed and tried to climb out, but it was too heavy for the tentacles and a little legwork to be enough. Undone by its own weight, the airavatan was stuck between the sides of the ravine like a cork in a bottle. And the sight of that struck another spark of madness, because sometimes a problem was a solution. His boot was done coming apart and Sarai told him it was safe, so he tore into his pants and made strips to wrap around the bottom of the boot. A temporary solution, but better than going barefoot.

Yong asked what he was doing when he limped away, avoiding resting on his bad foot, but he did not reply as he headed back into the grass. Where Sanale had been taken after he missed his throw. The cithara lay broken on the green, stepped on out of spite, and translucent feathers had spilled all over. Tristan took off his hat and knelt by them, stuffing what he could inside the tricorn. He doubled back after, returning to the monster writhing between the cliffs.

The airavatan struggled and raged, shaking the earth as it tried to drag itself out of the trap with its tentacles. The complete silence lent the sight a touch of the surreal, as if this were a waking dream, but Tristan’s mind felt alight. Hat in hand he limped to the edge of the ravine, the raging heliodoran beast, and overlooking the great expanse of pale flesh he smiled a cold smile.

He emptied the feathers on the beast’s back.

They fell down in a rain, scattering in a wind that did not exist, and the monster shivered. Its limbs heaved again, then slowly they dropped. It went still save for the slow rising of its breath, remaining stuck between the cliffs from sheer size. Slowly the mist faded, thinning into nothingness, until Tristan could hear someone walking up behind him. Yong came to stand at his side, a veiled lantern in hand.

“Why bother?” the Tianxi asked. “It was already trapped.”

“What is it you see in front of us, Yong?” he asked.

“Waste,” the Tianxi shrugged. “What would you claim is there?”

“A bridge,” Tristan Abrascal replied.

He went back and took his cabinet, slinging it onto his back with a word, and as he reached the edge of the cliff he pressed his hat down onto his head. Looking down at the airavatan, the thief took a limping step forward. Then another and another, until he was all the way across.

The beast did not wake.

Not when Tristan did it, and not when all the others followed after him either.

# Chapter 19

It was a long and narrow road.

Past the woods, where the crags met the mountains, a tunnel dove into the rock. Angharad was too bone-tired to do more than stumble forward through it. There were lanterns and stairs, the winding of the road taking them back outside – on the side of the mountain, with only a ramshackle wooden railing in the way of the precipitous drop below – before going up in a jagged zig-zag. In the distance she saw an island darkened, a realm of monsters and darklings with the stars fixed far above in firmament’s crown. The wind moaned plaintively, shaking the railing, and never had she felt more like she’d reached some edge of the world.

Was that what it had felt like, for Mother?

No, it couldn’t be. Angharad felt no wonder, no joy. Only blood drying on her face, the cut on her scalp itching and the smell of the filth and dirt she’d squirmed against. Her limbs were made of lead, her head spun around like a weathervane. There had been no discovery here, no horizon reclaimed from the Gloam. She had just cut and been cut until she was made to crawl through shame and corpses. She had won in honour, or as close as her saber had been able to reach to that, but now it felt like such a passing thing. Angharad forced herself up the stairs, their hypnotic back and forth of angles going up the mountainside, but time slipped through her fingers like sand.

How long had she been walking?

Every lantern, every step felt the same and there was no sign of the promised sanctuary. Had Song not promised to wait for her? Yet here she stood alone. Angharad licked dry lips, but all it did was salt the bloody cracks. One more step, she told herself. Always one more step, until she reached the yellow lanterns and their promise of safety. She slipped, landing on her knees, but was too exhausted to let out more than a moan of pain. The wind echoed her, mocking. She turned to chide it, to let out something of the scream stills tuck in her throat, but her vision swam.

She felt her knees give and there was a burst of pain, then nothing.

—

Warmth and cool. A blanket above, but beneath her was stone digging at her back.

“- should be fine, she hasn’t lost so much blood she would die from it.”

Eyes fluttering open, Angharad let out a hiss of pain at the bright burn of the lanterns. She shaded her vision with her hand, finding her hand slow – as if she’d just gone through a great exertion. In many ways, she had.

“Ah,” a voice she recognized said. “Back with us, Lady Tredegar.”

Grey eyes looked down at her, the apprentice physician – if he was truly that – Tristan meeting her gaze as he wiped his hands with a dirty rag. He had, she noticed, a swollen black eye.

“I-” Angharad tried, but found her mouth felt full of cotton.

She swallowed, which helped a little.

“Where are we?” she got out.

“On the stairs to sanctuary,” Tristan informed her. “Where you fell unconscious. I had a look at you, however, and there is nothing to worry about. That cut on your head could do with stitches, but your wounds are rather minor.”

He paused.

“I assume your state comes from lack of sleep or contract overuse,” the Sacromontan said. “Either way, given some rest you should be back on your feet after a day or two.”

I do not have a day or two, she thought. The longer she gave Augusto Cerdan, the better the chances he would somehow wriggle away out of this. And what if he tried to call their duel while she was unfit to fight? None of this, though, was Tristan’s concern.

“Thank you,” Angharad croaked. “For the help.”

“Thank Yong,” Tristan shrugged. “It’s his herbero I used to disinfect your wounds and wash your face. It’s the cheap stuff from Estebra District, so it’s halfway to grain alcohol.”

The Pereduri sniffed at the air, brow knotting. Was that peppermint she smelled?

“Foul stuff,” Tristan sympathized. “But I’d recommend a swallow or two from the flask to get you fit to walk anyway.”

Angharad was beginning to reconsider her assumption that he was a physician. Or at least a proper one. He might have been like one of those shipboard doctors she’d heard about, whose only two remedies were maize beer and rum. Smiling, the man withdrew and was replaced by a familiar face: Lady Ferranda Villazur, looking ragged and red-eyed. The noblewoman offered her a hand.

“Up, Lady Angharad,” Ferranda said. “The faster we reach sanctuary, the faster we can rest.”

She took the hand but wriggled around to keep the blanket on her, adjusting it over her shoulders after Ferranda hoisted her up. Though clothed, she felt cold. Her vision swam for a moment, but a long breath later she was fine. Enough so that she could take in the sight of the people gathered further down the stairs. A ragged pair of middle age were the furthest down, the man of the pair holding up an old woman with a mangled leg on his back. Above them an old man leaned against the wall, and then there were a few she knew by name: Lan, the remaining twin with blue lips, and Yong, the soldier who she must thank for the use of his drink.

There was no sign of Sanale, an absence that had her heart squeezing in sympathy for Ferranda, and the last then should be – Angharad froze, then began reaching for a saber she no longer had. A hollow, they had a hollow among them. Had they made a pact with the cultists like Tupoc? Half the others immediately pointed weapons at her.

“She is not a darkling,” Yong said, tone even.

“She can speak for herself,” Sarai – for it could only be her – firmly told the Tianxi. “I believe your family are seafarers, Lady Tredegar, so you ought to know the name of Triglau.”

Angharad’s shoulders lost some of their tension.

“The northern colonies,” she slowly said. “You are of the peoples below the Broken Gates.”

“Not so broken, before your people came,” Sarai coldly replied. “Like many other things.”

Angharad coughed into her hand, embarrassed. In truth she knew little of the Triglau, for her mother’s travels had been to the east and not the north, but she did know a few things. For one, Triglau was the name for the endless petty chiefdoms of that land as well as the people themselves. Unlike the people of Malan, they had never grown past their tribal roots.

“I apologize for the discourtesy,” Angharad awkwardly said. “I assure you, not all of the Isles believe slavery without evil.”

“Splendid news,” Sarai replied with a politely savage smile. “Why, near half the Malani I’ve ever met have assured me the same. No doubt the slave trade will be ending any day now.”

There was a long, barren stretch of silence. Then Tristan snorted out a laugh, which was shoddily turned into a cough.

“I’ve just seen to her wounds, Sarai, don’t murder her right afterwards,” he said. “It’s very inconsiderate of my time.”

“Time we are wasting,” Lady Ferranda mildly said. “Shall we get moving instead of chattering like magpies?”

“Fucking finally,” the middle-aged man below bit out. “How light to do you think she is?”

He gestured at the old woman on his back, who Angharad only now noticed had a bandage-covered eye under broken spectacles.

“Felis,” the woman by him chided.

“I have been eating a lot of croquetas,” the old woman admitted.

Amusement spread, the earlier unpleasantness thinning. Tristan and Sarai took the lead – she only now noticed that the Sacromontan was limping, and one of his boots was wrapped with bandages – to begin the climb. Angharad was tugged forward by Lady Ferranda. The other woman leaned close.

“Stay on Sarai’s good side,” she murmured. “She’s joined to the hip with Tristan and he was Yong’s favorite even before we all came to owe him.”

Angharad slowly nodded. She then hesitated, not sure whether she should ask. Ferranda noticed and her face tightened.

“Sanale was caught by the airavatan,” she curtly said. “We nearly all died to it as well.”

“My condolences,” the dark-skinned noblewoman said.

A platitude, but she meant every word. Retainers that had been with you for long were as family, and Lady Ferranda was obviously taking his loss hard. Ferranda nodded, a tad shortly.

“What happened for you to end up alone and unconscious on the stairs?” she asked. “I thought you were to stay with the others.”

“Augusto Cerdan murdered his valet to flee from lupines faster,” Angharad flatly said. “Naturally, I challenged him to an honour duel.”

Ferranda’s eyes widened.

“Naturally,” she repeated, though her voice was a little strange.

“As a consequence, when we later encountered an ambush by Tupoc Xical and the cult of the Red Eye he betrayed us in an attempt to rid himself of me while running away,” she continued. “In doing so, he also threw away the lives of Isabel, Master Cozme and his own brother.”

Their conversation was interrupted by Tristan butting in, abandoning Sarai at the front as he slowed to stay just ahead of them.

“All these were caught by the cultists?” he asked, sounding surprised.

Though Angharad was miffed at both the presumption he could force his way into the conversation and the tacit admission he had been eavesdropping, she bit down on a sharp reply. She owed a debt for his treatment.

“No,” she replied. “As far as I know only Briceida, one of Lady Isabel’s handmaids, was captured. I fought to slow down the enemy before shaking them off but took some wounds in doing so. The others fled ahead and I lost blood. You then found me in the stairs.”

It was not reasonable, Angharad reminded herself, to feel abandoned by this. She had good as ordered them to leave her behind. And yet. Don’t be childish, she ordered herself. Both Tristan and Ferranda looked skeptical at the implication of her minor wounds having undone her so, but as both deduced the fuller truth had to do with a contract neither pressed the matter.

“You are not the only one who fought Tupoc and his men,” Lady Ferranda told her. “Lady Inyoni lost one of her own to him as well.”

That was sad news, but not without a silver lining. She would not be short on allies when she urged for them to string up the traitor and his brood.

“He betrayed one of his own subordinates,” Angharad said with open disgust. “He sold out Leander Galatas to the hollows when they complained too few had been delivered into their hands.”

Tristan’s brow knotted at the news. Had he been friends with the man?

“He is burning too many bridges,” the scruffy Sacromontan said. “He must still have something up his sleeve to think he’d get away with it.”

“Then let us end him before that,” Angharad said. “He should be made to stand before a tribunal of the rest of us the moment he steps out of sanctuary, do you not agree?”

The reactions were the opposite of what she had expected: Tristan’s face displayed some enthusiasm at the notion while Ferranda’s closed. She had thought the infanzona bolder than this and the man more cowardly. Why else would he have only browbeaten those weaker than him?

“It may not be that easy,” Lady Ferranda said. “The Trial of Ruins may well force our hand otherwise.”

I look forward to working with you in the second trial, Lady Tredegar, the pale-eyed traitor had smiled down at her. Angharad’s belly clenched in rage. Had he done it all knowing he would be able to wriggle his way out of consequences?

“How?” she asked.

How was he to trick his way out, and how could she make him choke on his trickery instead?

“That is a conversation that can wait until we reach sanctuary,” Ferranda firmly replied. “The next step can wait until this one is taken.”

Angharad grimaced but did not contradict her. Tristan returned to the fore, and after the Pereduri saw the look of grief Ferranda’s face when she asked about how their company had crossed the river she let the matter drop. Instead she inquired as to what still lay between them and the yellow lanterns, a change of subject the infanzona eagerly seized upon. It turned out, embarrassingly enough, that that Angharad had collapsed less than an hour away from the end of the trial. They went up the jagged stairs, then into another tunnel of bare stone that headed deep into the mountain.

The supports keeping the ceiling from collapse were made of wood or iron, but unlike the earlier railing they were in a fine state. The Watch kept them in good order.

“The maze is within a cavern, then?” Angharad asked.

“It is that in the same way that Vesper is a cavern,” Ferranda said. “You will see.”

Before long, Angharad did. The tunnel ended abruptly into a precipitous flight of carved stairs, but she hardly spared a look for those. Blowing wind threatened to put out their lanterns, but there was no need of those to see: from the ceiling of the gargantuan underground chamber hung great pieces of gold giving out a ghostly glow, slowly moving as if the world’s greatest crib mobile. Below it – and them -was spread out the Trial of Ruins in all its glory.

First a fort surrounded by yellow lanterns, dilapidated bastions guarding over a massive iron gate set in pillar of stone that rose all the way to the ceiling. But it was what lay beyond that had her breath catching in her throat: a city of broken shrines. It was as if some mad spirit had stolen a thousand ancient temples and mausoleums and tossed them into a haphazard pile that filled the entire chamber, making a mountain-maze of the lost and sacred. Angharad could see no path above, no more than if she were trying to climb a mountain within the mountain. They would have to go through the labyrinth to get on the other end of the chamber, not around it.

Behind her there were gasps and she was almost stumbled into, the toothless old man gazing at the sight with open wonder. He looked the most alive she had seen of him yet.

“It is true, then,” Francho breathed out. “Shrines from islands halfway across the Trebian Sea, all drawn here by some god’s hand.”

“This place is known?” Angharad asked.

“In some circles,” the old man evaded. “It has long been said the Watch locks away on the Dominion gods that are too dangerous to let loose, but the rumour is dubious in provenance.”

The old man sucked at his gums thoughtfully. Angharad was polite enough not to wrinkle her nose in distaste.

“The scope of this does seem beyond even them,” Francho said.

Angharad could only agree, for there must be hundreds and hundreds of ruins here: how could any assembly of men bring these inside a hollow mountain through those narrow stairs they had earlier climbed? It would not do to block the way so the Pereduri began her way down the stone stairs. They were mercifully dry, but the slope steep and utterly without railing. Angharad took care in climbing down, until finally she reached flat and solid ground. She waited there with the vanguard until the rest of the company caught up, eyes peeled on the even stretch of stone ahead of them leading straight to the old fort encircled by yellow lanterns.

Sanctuary.

The proceeded only after everyone had gathered, the mood growing buoyant with safety just in sight. The fort was a sprawling thing, shaped as a square of tall walls with pointed bastions peeking out of the corners. It was also half a ruin, parts of the walls collapsed and only two of the bastions still whole. There were lanterns on the ramparts beyond the yellow ones outside, and in their glow the silhouettes of black-cloaked men armed with muskets could be seen. The ‘gate’ was a collapsed wall, guarded by a pair of bored watchmen who betrayed little interest when their company came in sight.

One of the two, a tall woman of Sacromontan look, counted them out loud.

“Ten, huh?” she mused. “Maybe it’ll not be a complete loss this year. With the others inside, you should have the numbers for the maze.”

The other watchman laughed at her words.

“Head in,” he told them. “You are now formally under sanctuary after having completed the Trial of Lines. Congratulations.”

A pause.

“There’s warm food and supplies ahead.”

No amount of rudeness could have prevented a swelling a joy after being told that.

“If you want to withdraw under our protection,” the watchman said, “find Lieutenant Wen.”

“Thank you,” Yong replied.

After a polite nod the Tianxi was the first to take the slender ‘gate’, the rest lining up to follow behind him. Angharad was fifth in line and went with a spring to her step: she was eager to see how her companions had fared without her. Yet as she made to enter the fort the watchwoman of the pair stopped her – laid a hand on her arm. Angharad frowned at her for the presumption.

“Angharad Tredegar?” the tall Sacromontan asked.

“Correct,” she coolly replied.

The watchwoman’s expression brightened.

“Good, we were getting afraid you wouldn’t make it,” she said. “There’s going to be an unreasonably pretty Malani by the cooking pots, Sergeant Mandisa. You’re to go to her.”

Angharad blinked.

“May I ask why?”

“Because we all like brandy,” the other woman drily replied. “Go on, then.”

Mystified at the nonsense reply, Angharad obeyed and caught up to Franchi as he entered a great courtyard. It was, she saw, the beating heart of this ruined fort. A wide open space of cracked paving stones led up to the rampart at the back and the massive iron gate set into it. Most everyone seemed to have made a home there, including the Watch: the blackcloaks had claimed an old barracks on the left side, its windows barred and stripes of dark paint marking it as off-limits. Besides them stairs went up to one of the still still-standing bastions, atop which great lanterns hung and someone appeared to have set up astronomical equipment.

On the opposite side of the courtyard the Watch had built out of old stables a series small ‘rooms’: stalls with planks for roof and curtains hung as doors. It would be a thin illusion of privacy but still more than Angharad had been graced with in weeks – months, even, moving between ships and inns since leaving the Isles. Further back stood what looked like a cross between a lumberyard and smithy, used only by a thick watchman chopping wood, but what drew Angharad’s eye was not at the sides of the courtyard but the very heart. Tables were set in a loose circle around a makeshift kitchen, with a shoddy brick oven and cooking hearth.

And rising from one of the tables to the right, abandoning steaming bowls of stew, were the companions she had parted ways with.

“Angharad!” Isabel called out, running forward.

The dark-haired beauty shot past Tristan and Sarai, barely slowing as she half-leapt into Angharad’s arms. As surprised as she was delighted, she caught the infanzona by the waist and held her up to avoid the both of them being bowled over. Isabel laughed as she was spun and set down, grinning all the while.

“I knew you’d make it,” she said. “I just knew.”

“It was a close-run thing,” Angharad admitted. “Had I not been found by our friends here I might have died on the stairs.”

“Then I must thank them most earnestly,” Isabel said.

She got on the tip of her toes to peek over Angharad’s shoulder, beaming at those standing there – now most of the crew she had arrived with – and noticeably not moving out of being held by the waist. Noticeably to Angharad, anyway. She reluctantly extricated herself from Isabel only to be crowded by the others. Master Cozme shook her hand, complimenting her on a ‘daring escape’ and even Remund spared the sneer to tell her he was glad she was still with them. Brun contained himself to a nod but he was smiling, and Song went around inspecting her and sighing.

“You looked like you’ve crawled through dirt,” the Tianxi complained.

“I did,” Angharad flatly replied.

“I’ll let you take my place in the line for use of the washtub, then,” Song told her. “It would be criminal to do otherwise.”

Recognizing that for the affection it was, Angharad let go of the sliver of irritation that’d been rising. Song was, if perhaps not yet a friend, then at least a good companion. She was not to be begrudged a bit of fussing. Her gaze strayed, for she had yet to see Beatris, and she found the other survivors from the Bluebell arrayed around the tables. Some had risen to greet people she had come with, but other simply looked on with interest. Tupoc and his surviving traitors, Acanthe Phos and Ocotlan, sat away from the others.

As did Augusto Cerdan, who rose to his feet face with an ashen face when she found his eyes.

“All right, all right,” a voice cheerfully called out. “Enough of that, my lambkins. We are no longer feeding the fire under the pot, so that stew’s only going to get colder.”

Angharad wrenched her gaze away from Augusto to the new speaker, finding a woman who must be Sergeant Mandisa. The sergeant’s green eyes were set in high-cheeked face with lustrous dark skin, standing even taller than Angharad -who was taller than most. Neither her black cloak nor the uniform beneath managed to hide the voluptuousness of her curves, which seemed most irrepressible.  Unreasonably pretty indeed. Angharad would have expected to see such a beauty at court, not in the depths of this cursed island.

“Sergeant Mandisa?” she asked.

“I am,” she easily replied. “Why do you ask?”

“I was told by the watchwoman at the gate that-”

She was interrupted by a man coming passing her by and brusquely setting a wooden chest on the nearest table, the slamming sound making those closest start in surprise. He then set down a bottle of green grass by the chest and glanced at Sergeant Mandisa. She straightened, then slammed her palm against the table.

“Silence,” she shouted. “Silence for the officer.”

Given her previous air of cheer, the sudden turn had them all settling down within moments. The noblewoman’s eyes moved to the man who must be the officer in question and was taking them all in silently.

He was a big man, Tianxi in looks and nearly of a height with Angharad but with a massive belly barely tucked into his black coat and gilet, distending the fabric over waist-high trousers. Many watchmen bore criss-crossing bandoleers, but he wore his as straps instead. He should have looked comical, a fat man in a tight uniform, but the confidence in the way he held himself smothered that notion in the crib. The officer went fishing through his coat, taking out a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles that he carefully unfolded and put on. His gaze swept through them, more than a few straightening their backs.

“My name is Lieutenant Wen,” he said. “I share command of the Old Fort’s garrison with Lieutenant Vasanti, who if you are very lucky you might once see in passing. She’s not particularly interested in people when there’s fleshy bits left on the bones.”

He smiled, though there was little friendliness to it.

“Most of you will have met Sergeant Mandisa,” Lieutenant Wen said, gesturing to the woman at his side. “Remember her face, for she has been charged with seeing to your needs and deciding if any of you need to be shot for breaking our very, very simple rules.”

Sergeant Mandisa, still incongruously pretty in her own black cloak and coat, waved at them with a smile so charming it should make flowers bloom. The Tianxi lieutenant raised three fingers, then slowly folded one.

“One, stay out of left side of the fort. That is to say the barracks, the bastion and the supply depot,” Lieutenant Wen said. “If you do not, you will be immediately…”

“Shot,” Sergeant Mandisa cheerfully finished, branding her fingers like a pistol and shooting it at Tupoc.

The Aztlan had the gall to wink back.

“Two,” Lieutenant Wen continued, folding a second finger, “should any of you contract with a god within the ruins, you must immediately report having done so upon returning to sanctuary. If you do not…”

“Shot,” Sergeant Mandisa helpfully provided, smacking her fist into her palm.

Had they practiced this, Angharad wondered? They must have.

“And three,” the fat lieutenant said, taking his hand away, “there is to be no killing of each other within the bounds of the yellow lanterns. As a particular extension of this, should any of you choose to retire from the trials and come under the Watch’s protection any attempted violence against them will be met with as slow and inventive a death as we can figure out.”

He smiled again, even less friendly.

“We’ve got a tinker from the Umuthi Society around and it does get dreadfully boring out here,” Lieutenant Wen said. “So you can bet it’ll be a spectacle.”

The blackcloak then clapped his hands, startling a few of the faint-hearted among their company, and slid his thumbs into his belt.

“Simple rules, as I said, but let it not be said I am not an accommodating man,” Lieutenant Wen said. “Are there any questions?”

Angharad cleared her throat, unsure whether or not she should raise her hand. The Tianxi turned an amused eye on her, as if able to read her thoughts.

“And you are?” he asked.

“Lady Angharad Tredegar,” she replied.

“Ah,” the lieutenant said, tone turning gregarious, “Captain Osian’s niece! Good, good. I put ten arboles on your reaching the Trial of Weeds, so do try not to die.”

“I will… do my best?” Angharad hesitantly answered.

The man chuckled.

“Go on, girl.”

Rallying, the Pereduri cleared her throat again.

“Am I to understand that the Watch does not care if a killing takes place beyond the lines of sanctuary?” she asked.

“You’re free to butcher each other all you like out there in the maze,” Lieutenant Wen agreed. “I wouldn’t recommend it, given how it works, but we’re not here to hold your hand.”

The Tianxi was only half paying attention by the end of the sentence, popping open the box on the table and riffling within. He produced a cigar, which he brought close and smelled with obvious relish. Angharad hid her distaste – Mother had enjoyed these as well, but she shared her father’s opinion that the smell was simply foul. Someone else cleared their throat. Lord Ishaan, the chubby-cheeked man from the Imperial Someshwar. He looked pale, and his hair sweaty. Neither he nor his companion Shalini had been sitting at the same table as Lady Inyoni and her nephew, even though they had come together.

“Wow does the maze work?” he asked. “We have yet to be told.”

“We sent out a detachment when the first of you arrived to check which passages are open this year,” Lieutenant Wen replied. “They’ll be back sometime during the night, barring disaster. You will all be summoned to an assembly come morning so the practicalities of the trial might be explained.”

Tupoc Xical stepped forward then, drawing many eyes – and few of them friendly.

“Are we allowed to begin the trial early if we wish?” the Aztlan asked.

Lieutenant Wen laughed.

“There’s a cliff around here you can jump down from instead,” he said, “that’ll at least save us having to retrieve your corpse. But sure, Izcalli, you can start early.”

He pointed past the walls, to another hole in the rampart.

“Head that way, the Lion Shrine opens almost every year,” Lieutenant Wen said. “And shout for help when you get caught, would you?”

He beamed at the Aztlan, the cheer having a vicious tinge to it.

“We won’t be coming, but it’ll draw other gods so you might die quicker.”

Angharad was beginning to suspect there might be a reason Lieutenant Wen had been assigned to garrison duty under a mountain on a largely inhabited island in the middle of nowhere.

“Thank you,” Tupoc replied, looking entirely unperturbed.

Angharad was learning to hate how nothing shook him. Her hand was itching for a blade to hold.

“Any other questions?” the lieutenant asked.

There were not, so he reminded them they could ask Sergeant Mandisa for supplies and invited them to rest until tomorrow – or had begun the last part, at least, when Angharad moved. The questions were finished, so courtesy had been observed. She brushed past a confused Shalini and a grinning Lan, ignored Ocotlan as he raised his fists in a fighting stance and then Augusto Cerdan was facing her. Not a scratch on the man, save for his broken arm now in a sling.

He sneered, opening his mouth, and Angharad socked him in the stomach.

He folded, letting out a wheeze of pain, and there was a ripple in the crowd as people made room for them. Angharad sought out Remund Cerdan in the crowd and caught his gaze, giving him a slight nod. After a heartbeat of hesitation he returned it. As for Master Cozme, who stood by the younger brother’s side, his face was conflicted. She would have to trust that Remund’s orders and the earlier betrayal tipped the balance of loyalties the correct way.

She chose not to look for Isabel.

“As I did not strike you in the face, you may choose to consider yourself as not having been challenged to a duel,” Angharad told Augusto.

She would not turn down an opportunity to strike him a third time.

“You bitch,” the infanzon hissed.

“Augusto Cerdan, for the betrayal of myself and three others to cultists of the Red Eye I call you to answer blade in hand,” Angharad implacably replied.

She had given her word to Cozme Aflor that she would not pursue her challenge of Augusto until the end of the second trial, but she was following those words exact. Let the Fisher say what he would, Angharad would not bend her neck to the ways of the world: she could survive without carving away at her own principles, and if there were prices to pay for that so be it.

“You don’t even have a sword!” Augusto protested, taking a step back.

There was a snort from behind them.

“She may havbe mine,” Song said.

The infanzon’s eyes dilated with fear as he swept the crowd and found no support there. The Cerdan brothers had made few friends and Augusto burned bridges with even those. He reached for his sword, giving Angharad an excuse to dart forward and hit him in the belly again, catching his wrist and slamming the blade back in the sheath. She caught him by the collar and began dragging him towards the entrance to the Old Fort.

The flat grounds there were not within the span of the yellow lanterns, and so not sanctuary.

Augusto struggled, but his broken arm was in the way and she was stronger than her.

“Watchmen!” Augusto shouted. “This is murder, she breaks the spirit of the rules – you must intervene.”

Angharad paused there, for if the Watch intervened she would have to give way. Lieutenant Wen, still standing by the table, took a look at them and scratched a match on the tabletop. He pressed it against his cigar, pulling at it until the end burned cherry red. The Tianxi then breathed out a stream of smoke, cocking an eyebrow over his spectacles.

“I’m not seeing anything,” the watchman said. “Are you seeing anything, sergeant?”

Sergeant Mandisa, pulling off the cork on the bottle the lieutenant had earlier brought, began pouring herself a cup of the amber liquid within the green glass.

“Not a one, sir,” she prettily smiled. “And I’m trying real hard.”

Lieutenant Wen rested his hands on his bulging belly, offering a wide friendly smile while beaming at them both.

“Do give Captain Osian our regards when you next see him, Lady Angharad,” the Tianxi mused. “The brandy and cigars have made garrison duty much more tolerable.”

Sergeant Mandisa raised a silent toast to his words. Angharad was split between horror and gratitude. Her uncle’s doing was freeing her to deal out justice, but he had also quite obviously bribed these people. Even back on the Bluebell, he’d had a friend watching out for her in the crew. How many strings had Uncle Osian pulled – and how many of them were crooked?

When it sunk in that no help was coming, Augusto let out a noise that was whimper trying to be a scream.

“How dare you,” he babbled as Angharad dragged him forward. “House Cerdan will-”

He tried to get his blade out again so she twisted his broken arm and forced the steel back into its sheath while he screamed.

“They will hunt you like an animal,” Augusto hissed, “to the ends of the-”

Mere feet to the break in the rampart now, she could already see the yellow glow of the lanterns outside. The entrance to the fort was well-lit, lanterns hanging from the ramparts, so there was no missing it when a shadow caught up to her. Cutting across the floor it slithered, warning her of the arrival before Tupoc Xical ever came to stand before her.

Between Angharad and the way out.

Augusto began struggling again, so she stomped down on his foot.

“What is this, Xical?” she coldly asked.

“I am,” the Aztlan grinned, “defending the weak.”

The sheer absurdity of what he’d just said gave her pause. Enough that Augusto was able to wriggle out of her grasp, and though she kicked him down to his hands and knees she saw Tupoc hefting his segmented spear and she was yet unarmed. She was not, however, alone. Behind her a pistol was cocked as Song came to stand at her left, and to her right Brun pressed something into her hand – a straight sword, Song’s own. The Sacromontan held his hatchet, and tough he smiled reassuringly his eyes were cold. Angharad’s fingers closed around the blade, weighing it.

It was a little lighter than she’d like, but it would do.

“Move,” Angharad Tredegar told her enemy, “or be moved.”

Augusto crawled towards his protector and she let him, for it would not matter. From the corner of her eye, the Pereduri saw that Ocotlan was moving to flank them. The crowd looked reluctant to intervene, but the escalation was losing her support. No one wanted a full-on skirmish.

“Alas, I think we will have to save that dance for another day,” Tupoc wistfully told her.

A heartbeat later there was a sharp crack and stone went flying as a shot was fired on the ground between them. Above them, on all sides, blackcloaks were pointing their muskets. Lieutenant Wen, looking irritated, strode past her and pivoted to turn a glare on everyone. Sergeant Mandisa followed him, levelling their way the largest blunderbuss Angharad had ever seen. It was already cocked and the Malani looked a little too eager to use it for comfort.

“Enough,” he ordered. “Weapons down, all of you, or I’ll have you strung up.”

Angharad gritted her teeth even as Tupoc made a show of dismantling his spear, pale eyes smiling at her all the while. Brun’s hatchet came down, though, and Song’s muzzle dipped.

“It’s over, Angharad,” the silver-eyed Tianxi sighed. “They get away with it for now.”

Lieutenant Wen stared her down until she lowered her sword, then nodded in satisfaction. She watched Augusto offering grovelling thanks to his saviour with disgust. Walking away, the bespectacled lieutenant stopped to clap her shoulder and lean in. His sergeant was but a step behind.

“Sorry, Tredegar, but Xical’s not just yiwu trash come here for bragging rights,” he told her. “He’s to become one of us, like you, so it’s out of my hands. We can only play favourites so much.”

He left her standing there, rooted to the ground and facing the Malani sergeant’s cheerful face.

“Don’t lose heart, lambkin,” Sergeant Mandisa comforted her. “It’s really easy to murder people in the maze, so you’ll still have plenty of chances!”

Angharad wondered what it said about her that the perky madwoman’s words did, in fact, cheer her up a bit.

# Chapter 20

The consolation prizes for being denied her duel were several.

Sergeant Mandisa sent a Watch surgeon to stitch the cut on her head and she sat down for a hot meal afterwards. Little more than stew and bread, but both were warm and after days on the run she would have been delighted by even a warm rock. She polished both off and Sergeant Mandisa even offered her a thimble of brandy, which she had not anyone else, before clapping her shoulder.

“There’s a few swords in the armoury,” she said. “Have a look when you’re done.”

A pause as the beautiful sergeant looked her up and down.

“Wen said I should remind you there’s clothes as well, if you want something to take something, but that shirt-and-coat look you went with is pretty ravishing,” Sergeant Mandisa praised.

Angharad went still as a statue, thimble in hand.

“It is shockingly fashionable,” Isabel agreed, eyes smiling. “I could see it taking in salons with the right adjustments – perhaps a silk sash around the waist or an open vest?”

“Coloured breast bindings,” the Malani sergeant suggested. “That way you can make them out through the shirt.”

“Scandalous,” Isabel appreciatively said.

Angharad hunched over and drank her thimble of brandy, as sadly it was impossible for her to disappear down it from sheer mortification. Perhaps a vest was in order, if the Watch kept any. Her coat needed mending again anyhow. Sergeant Mandisa strolled away after clapping her on the back again, leaving her to embarrassment.

“There’s a well for drinking water and another for the washtub,” Brun informed her, perhaps taking pity. “I’ll show you where so you can clean up.”

“That would be a fine thing,” Angharad admitted.

Tristan had done good work getting rid of the blood, but he had not been interested in the filth beyond what might get into her wounds. She was surprised Isabel could stomach to sit across from her given how she must smell.

“I have the first place in line after the Watch is done using it,” Song told her. “As I said before our interlude, you can have it.”

“That is kind of you,” Angharad said, nodding her thanks.

“It the least we owe,” the Tianxi meaningfully said.

Her gaze turned to the end of the table, distracting Angharad from reminding her she owed nothing at all: Song had saved her life on the Bluebell. The silver-eyed woman was staring at the two sitting near the edge, Master Cozme and Remund Cerdan. Both were keeping silent, looking uncomfortable. Now that the heat of the moment had passed, both were wrestling with the reality that they had surrendered Augusto Cerdan to her blade. It was Cozme Aflor who broke first, shaking his head.

“It is as she said,” he admitted. “And you kept your word to the letter: it’s another duel you tried to fight.”

There was a coolness to the way he beheld her now, a wariness. Had he guessed using the precise wording was her intention all along? Remund Cerdan, on the other hand, looked more tired and angry than anything else.

“Would that you were able to end him,” he said. “Cozme would not hear of my seeing to it myself-”

“I have explicit orders otherwise,” the soldier flatly said.

“- else he would not have reached sanctuary alive,” Remund continued, teeth gritted. “He tried to murder us with that shot, to murder me.”

“I would have struck him down if Song had not stopped me,” Brun admitted. “Before we all ran, I mean.”

“The last thing we needed was to start fighting each other,” Song flatly replied. “All it would accomplish was help the cultists.”

Cozme nodded at her gratefully, then hesitated when looking Angharad’s way.

“Augusto Cerdan is no longer under my protection,” he finally told her. “I ensured he reached sanctuary and had the opportunity to withdraw from the trials, I owe nothing more.”

“He will stay, then?” Angharad said, honestly surprised.

Remund laughed unkindly.

“He must,” the younger Cerdan said. “He will be disgraced when Isabel and I return to Sacromonte, perhaps even cast out of our house.”

“Unless Lord Cerdan seeks a feud with House Ruesta, he will most certainly be cast out,” Isabel coldly stated.

“You believe he will try to kill you,” Angharad slowly said. “To prevent word getting back.”

“Not prevent, that would be too difficult. But it is understood between the houses that deaths on the Dominion are to be left on the Dominion,” Isabel explained. “Conflict has occurred before, you understand. He would be stretching the bounds of tolerance, of course, but if he returns and we do not…”

“Any heir is better than none,” Remund said, face pulled tight. “Our father is not a sentimental man.”

Angharad glanced at Cozme, who seemed to be treating this as none of his affair. He avoided her gaze, which was confirmation enough. The Pereduri hid her disgust at the thought that a kinslayer might be welcomed back into one’s family after the deed. It was absurd that Sacromonte might call itself a civilized nation without answering such a foul crime by being throwing the kinslayer down a cliff.

“But such talk can wait until tomorrow,” Isabel said. “Shall I ask Beatris to mend your coat again?”

Her smile as she said that was sly, a joke between only the two of them. Angharad was uncomfortable sharing in it before Remund Cerdan, however, who still seemed to be expecting these trials to end in a marriage.

“Please,” Angharad said, casting a look around.

Where was Beatris, anyhow? She had seen neither hide nor hair of Isabel’s sole remaining handmaid since she reached sanctuary.

“She is resting,” Isabel said, answering an unspoken question.

Song scoffed.

“She is catatonic,” the silver-eyed woman harshly corrected. “She came close to dying too many times for her nerves to keep holding and should not be on this island to begin with.”

Song matched Isabel’s cold look with one of her own. Angharad went still in surprise, for never before had the Tianxi been this bellicose with one of the infanzones – not even Augusto after he murdered Gascon. More surprising still, she gave no sign of backing down even in the face of Isabel’s open displeasure.

“We are all tired,” Angharad said. “And my coat can certainly wait.”

She rose to her feet, almost hastily.

“There was talk of a washtub, I believe?”

The two tore their gazes away from each other. Her request snuffed out the fuse for now, Song and Brun rising to help her as they had promised, but a line had clearly been drawn in her absence.

The washtub was little more than a barrel with a fire underneath, large enough for her to fit her body up to her neck in the water. The water was hot and it felt like being born anew to wash away all the filth and blood. She almost fell asleep inside and did not last long after getting out. The Watch had set out bedrolls in the small chambers made from the stables, so she simply claimed the one by Song’s and closed the curtain before crawling under the covers.

She was out in moments.

—

Angharad woke early, among the first to do so, and shambled out of her bedroll for a meal. Only a few had preceded her, among them Lady Acanthe and the Tianxi veteran called Yong. The two avoided each other and herself, and as the watchman charged with distributing the morning porridge – a horrid slop that tasted vaguely salty – did not feel like conversation either she ate in silence. By the time she was halfway through Song joined her, the two of them soon commiserating together about the fare. Conversation remained light.

“Your braids are coming undone,” Song told her.

She had suspected as much but could not be sure without a mirror.

“And the hair is gone dry,” Angharad sighed. “The rainwater did more damage than the bath, I think.”

At least her stitches did not sting even when she smiled.

“I cannot do anything for that, but I could help you with the braids,” Song offered. “I used to do my little sister’s.”

Angharad started in surprise.

“You have siblings?” she asked.

“I am the third of five,” the silver-eyed woman smiled. “My parents were very orderly: two boys, then three girls.”

“I am an only child myself,” Angharad shared. “I had some cousins from my mother’s younger brother, but I believe them to be dead.”

Uncle Arwel and his two boys had been in the manor when it was set aflame. None had come out.

“Your uncle in the Watch?”

“No, Uncle Osian is the elder of a pair,” Angharad said. “My mother had two younger brothers.”

Unlike Father, who like her had had been without siblings. She had never met her grandparents on that side of the family either, both having passed years before her birth. Talk of their families cast a pall on a conversation, so Angharad accepted the offer of help with her braids to tack on a different wind. Song took a bench and the Pereduri sat before her, finding it soothingly pleasant for someone to play with her hair. Both their moods improved and they sat there as the rest of the fort began to wake around them.

“Ishaan’s still looking sickly,” Song murmured.

Angharad’s eyes found the chubby-cheeked Someshwari in question, who like many among them was looking down at his bowl with a distinct lack of enthusiasm. He did look wan, she thought, and his elegant saffron tunic was touched with old sweat.

“It is not a good time to fall sick,” Angharad said.

“I do not believe he is, at least not in that sense,” Song told her. “Inyoni’s company arrived an entire day before the rest of us, but they ran into the heliodoran beast on the way. One of them used a contract on it to get away, and now Ishaan Nair looks sickly even though he had a day more to rest than the rest of us.”

It was, she would admit, a detail of significance. They spoke no more of it, however, for something else caught their eye. The old woman Angharad had journeyed with for a few hours, Vanesa, was being helped into a seat by Tristan. He then went to fetch them both porridge.

“Words is that the Watch physician advised they amputate the leg,” Song said. “She refused, but they won’t keep her on pain draughts forever – those are expensive, and if she cannot do the trial what do they care?”

“Did you learn how she was wounded?” Angharad asked. “It does not seem like Xical’s work or a darkling’s.”

She had not wanted to hurt Ferranda yesterday by prodding the fresh wound of Sanale’s death, but surely others of that group must have talked. Song chuckled.

“It’s a story worth hearing and they have not been shy in sharing it.”

Angharad listened intently at the tale, with every word more amazed any of them had lived at all. No doubt the events had been exaggerated, but to use an outwitted monster as a bridge was too livid a detail to have been entirely invented.

“Tristan did this?” she asked.

“And Sarai,” Song reminded her. “Signs are an art of great power.”

That much Angharad would not dispute, but she had a hard time believing that the same man who had beaten a nigh helpless woman for a pistol that had caught his fancy would take such risks for others. Song was nearly done with her braids by the time everyone was awake, and as the conversation ebbed low the noblewoman considered her way forward. Tupoc Xical must be made to pay for his actions, though not through some squalid murder as the sergeant had implied. A trial ought to take place, with crimes laid out and witnesses swearing oaths.

He had made enough enemies that Angharad liked her odds. The only questions was who she should approach first, Lady Inyoni or- her musings were cut short by a sunny Sergeant Mandisa walking out of the makeshift kitchen with a large copper pot, mercilessly beating it with a wooden spoon. She had the closest table, Yaretzi and Ferranda, wincing at the noise.

“Assemble, assemble,” the Malani sergeant called out. “An officer requires your attention.”

Most rose to their feet immediately, a handful inexplicably finishing the rest of their porridge first, but by the time Lieutenant Wen emerged from the barracks even those were standing. The Tianxi already has his gold-rimmed spectacles on and was tearing stripes off what looked like a piece of fresh bread. Once he finished the last, standing in front of everyone, he cleared his throat. The noise did not sound all that apologetic about making everyone wait while he ate.

“Our scouts are back,” Lieutenant Wen announced, “so as promised we will now go over the particulars of the second trial.”

Sergeant Mandisa came to stand by his side, still wielding the fearsome pot and spoon.

“The Trial of Ruins is just as simple as the first one was,” Lieutenant Wen said. “See how someone mislaid a pile of shrines behind me?”

It was hard to miss it, given that the vast majority of the great cavern had been swallowed up by the ruins. There was a general murmur of agreement, though no one committed so far as giving a legible answer. Already everyone had grasped that putting your foot forward with the lieutenant was a lot more likely to result in being made a figure of fun than garnering a reward.

“There are paths in there,” Lieutenant Wen said. “At the end of them lies a gate with a god trapped inside it: get there, cross the gate, and that’s it. That’s the entire trial.”

Someone cleared their throat. Cozme, Angharad recognized after a moment.

“So a maze requiring an offering at the end,” the mustachioed soldier stated. “Full of perils, one assumes?”

The corpulent watchman grinned at the other man, though there was much teeth to it and little amity.

“You’re an infanzon dog, Aflor, let’s not pretend you didn’t read up on everything before setting foot on the ship,” Lieutenant Wen said. “It’s a little like pretending your virginity mysteriously grew back after you set foot in the brothel.”

Master Cozme’s lips thinned and his mustache trembled with anger, but he held himself back from answering. Sergeant Mandisa cleared her throat. The Tianxi turned to glare at her but she just cleared it again, louder. Lieutenant Wen sighed.

“Fine,” he said. “I will be respectful of your delicate maidenhoods and ease you into this adventure with a proper, loving introduction.”

Angharad wondered whether politely requesting him to abandon that line of metaphor would make things better or worse. Worse, she decided. Almost certainly worse.

“Welcome to Trial of Ruins,” Lieutenant Wen said with caustic cheer. “We do not know who put those shrines in there and can’t be sure why, but we do one thing: they’re full of dead and dying gods.”

Spirits, he meant. Angharad was uncertain why a dead spirit’s existence should matter much – perhaps traces of power would remain, but surely no more than that? –  yet such a creature trapped and dying was certainly to be nothing to trifle with.

“Now that may sound like a bad thing,” Lieutenant Wen said, allowing a pause.

“Because it is!” Sergeant Mandisa helpfully provided.

“But it’s also how you’ll get through,” the Tianxi said, sliding his thumbs into his belt. “See, our friends out in the ruins can only get so far eating each other – diminishing returns, you know how it goes. Eating people, though? Now that’ll stave off extinction a decade or two. So they’ll let you into their shrines.”

“So they can eat you,” the Malani added, in case anyone had forgot.

“Not all shrines will open,” Lieutenant Wen warned them. “Some gods are sated, or too close to death or gone so mad they don’t remember how. In practice, that means you’ll be navigating a maze to get to the gate at the other end of the cavern.”

“Seems like a lot of gods to kill,” Shalini Goel skeptically said. “Could watchmen even do it?”

“We can’t,” Lieutenant Wen approvingly said. “But not for the reasons you think. If any of you are idiots or blind, you might have missed the giant spinning gold sky.”

To Angharad’s lack of surprise, no one stepped forward to name themselves a blind idiot by admitting that they had. Not that even the most unobservant of men could miss it: the only reason the cavern was not a pitch-black pit broken up only by the occasional lantern was the soft glow given off by the great machine hanging from the ceiling.

“We haven’t been able to get up there and confirm it’s Antediluvian work, but it seems likely,” Lieutenant Wen said. “Which is probably why it’s not just a very vain lantern: it’s also an aether machine placing restrictions on all gods within its area of influence.”

Angharad breathed in sharply and she was not the only one. It was one thing to walk the ruins of the First Empire, the worn and broken works of stone, another to walk in the light of one of their miraculous devices. No one had tamed Vesper the way the Antediluvians had, not even Liergan at its height.

“We have observed two restrictions,” Lieutenant Wen told them. “First, no god can do violence on anything but another god directly. Second, gods are bound to their shrine or seat of power. As a consequence of these, the Watch developed a method.”

“We’re going to make you bind your souls to boxes and bet them,” Sergeant Mandisa enthusiastically announced.

Angharad choked at the words, not quite believing what she’d just heard. She was not the only one. The bespectacled Tianxi glared at his sergeant.

“I was building up to that,” he reproached.

Notably, he did not contradict Sergeant Mandisa. The expression on Lieutenant Wen’s face might have passed for a pout if not for his inborn amount of spite making any application of the word unsuitable.

“Fine, the fun’s gone now anyway,” he sighed. “See, so long as terms are agreed on between mortal and god beforehand – and observed during – the aether machine does not consider what follows violence. So everyone has a chance at getting what they want: the god gives you a test, a game with rules, and if you fail or die during they get to eat your soul. If you win they let you through their territory, sometimes even throw in a prize.”

“Only the nice ones do that,” Sergeant Mandisa said. “There’s not a lot of those left, those that aren’t nice tend to eat them.”

“Should we have brought our own soul boxes, or will they be provided?” Shalini sarcastically asked.

“You can use ours,” Lieutenant Wen smiled. “It’s nothing all that sinister, Goel – a forged iron lantern splashed with your blood to serve as a mark on your presence in the aether. You’re technically gambling the marker, not your soul. It’s just so happens the marker’s enough for it to get at you.”

“You use aether seals?” Tupoc Xical asked, sounding genuinely surprised.

And pleased, for some reason. That did not bode well.

“Keep it in your pants, Leopard Society,” Lieutenant Wen replied, rolling his eyes. “It’s just a temporary mark. We’re not exactly burning souls to keep our candles lit, so don’t you start looking for a village or two to abduct.”

“This is vile calumny, lieutenant,” Tupoc replied with a friendly smile. “The Leopard Society’s purpose is the pursuit of criminals who flee beyond Izcalli borders, nothing more.”

The pair from the Someshwar loudly scoffed and Yong’s face might as well have been carved out of stone.

“Of course, of course,” Lieutenant Wen agreed.

A second later he gave the Aztlan the most exaggerated wink Angharad had ever seen.

“And the gate at the end?” Lady Inyoni called out. “Nothing else is simple, I will not believe that is.”

“Simple enough,” the bespectacled lieutenant said. “The god at the gate will not open unless ten or more of what it calls ‘victors’ – that is to say, those who bet their soul and won – are standing in front of it.”

Angharad bit the inside of her cheek. And there the nature of the trial changed again, Lieutenant Wen ripping the carpet out from under their feet. There were only twenty-five of them left, and of these several were no longer fighting fit. The Pereduri could not simply bet her soul ten times and gain victory enough to open the gate on her own, others needed to triumph as well. And if they lose even once, then or afterwards, that is the end of the line. That was why Tupoc was so certain he would get away with it: killing him was good as throwing away a victor. And he’ll kill some of us before we execute him, further slimming our odds.

Angharad considered her chances of simply killing him, without trial or verdict, the moment they stepped out of sanctuary. Alone she gave herself better than even odds, but it would not be quick and that meant complications. Ocotlan seemed likely to side with him in a fight, Augusto for certain and perhaps even Acanthe Phos. Angharad was not without allies of her own and Tupoc had certainly made enemies enough to be buried, but it would be a skirmish and not a duel. In that chaos, how many would be wounded or slain?

The costs would be too high.

Even if she gathered enough vengeful souls to strike with her, others would object: more afraid of the deaths ahead than angered by the deaths left behind. The moment Tupoc gathered someone to stand with him, showed it would be a fight and not an execution, her support would turn to mist. The trial she had wanted to arrange was good as buried. Angharad breathed in, let the indignation and the surge of rage – he’d been right, the smiling monster, he was going to get away with it – sink deep into her bones and let them simmer there as she calmed the surface of her.

Throwing a fit would serve no purpose but making her look unstable, unfit for alliance. Already she had attempted to kill Augusto yesterday, if she now had a tantrum because she would not be allowed to preside over the hanging of another trial-taker she would look like a bloodthirsty lunatic. For now her reputation was solid and Tupoc’s was as a full chamber pot: too foul for others to want to get close enough to throw it out, but that did not mean anyone was fond of the smell. She could not, would not set aside the demands of honour but Angharad was capable of biding her time. She would win oaths and allies, then get the last word. The dead were ever patient and she would not give any less than they.

By the time she had fully mastered herself, the conversation had moved on and the bespectacled watchman was speaking again.

“You’re a lucky bunch,” Lieutenant Wen jovially announced. “Three of the first row of shrines are open this year, so you’ve got plenty of paths to choose from.”

Lan raised her hand.

“Yes,” the lieutenant invited.

“Is that good?” she asked.

“That’s good,” Lieutenant Wen agreed. “It means dead ends are a lot less likely to force you through a shrine whose test will kill half of you.”

“It’s never the ones you expect either,” Sergeant Mandisa mused. “The Riddler-Teller’s usually such a sweetheart.”

Angharad made a firm and immediate decision to avoid any shrine whose spirit was named thus. When it became evident Lieutenant Wen would no longer speak unless prompted, the crowd began to disperse. Some of them had known of what was to come, at least part of it, but most would need time to digest the trial laying ahead. It was a man she believed part of the former that made his way towards her as others moved out of the way, making room. Space spread around them, out of either fear or manners. Angharad breathed in, back straight, and faced her enemy.

Tupoc Xical had come out of the Trial of Lines with nary a scuff on him.

There was a small rip in the long white skirts going to his ankles, already mended, but his collared green shirt and the dull breastplate he wore over it did not have so much as a stain. Angharad, who had only bathed once in several days and whose braids were not in the proper style, could only envy the way his long hair shone. Even the round earrings hanging from his ear had been freshly polished, flashing copper-gold whenever they caught the light. Her gaze must have lingered there, for Tupoc flicked one with a finger and gave her a smile.

“Like them?” the Izcalli asked. “They were a gift from my teacher when I declared my intention to enter the Watch.”

“So you are not a deserter, at least,” Angharad coolly replied.

The man clicked his tongue disapprovingly.

“I was offered help in that endeavour, Angharad Tredegar, not censure,” Tupoc informed her. “We hold the rooks in high esteem: they, too, understand the lessons of the Fifth Loss.”

It was a concession to manners and not the man that Angharad did not roll her eyes. She was in no mood to indulge the famous Aztlan superstitions, which the Kingdom of Izcalli had enshrined as dogma tacked on to the teachings of the Orthodoxy – the myth of some ancient lost war against the sky, ending in defeat and an exile that could only be turned back by triumphing over the Circle Perpetual. That the way to this triumph involved the Kingdom of Izcalli invading its neighbours at every opportunity had not endeared the preaching of Izcalli priesthood to anyone.

“And what would that be, Tupoc?” she said. “By the account of your deeds, I would suppose selling us out to cultists.”

“That the lights are fading,” Tupoc seriously replied. “That there can be no evil in any act undertaken to keep them on even a breath longer. What do you think the Watch is, Lady Tredegar?”

“The watchmen of Vesper,” she replied. “The keepers of the Iscariot Accords.”

“They are the lid on a very deep well,” Tupoc Xical said, shaking his head. “Only when they succeed in that duty can they spare the breath to be anything more.”

The too-perfect Aztlan smiled, utterly convinced of his words. Angharad might have spared some pity for him, for the way he must believe this to be able to look at himself in the mirror, were he not one of the vilest men she had ever met. No amount of paper-thin charm would make her forget the scream of terror that had ripped itself out of Briceida’s throat. Tiring of this playacting, of having to offer the monster manners, she sought his gaze and held it.

“What do you want?” she bluntly asked.

“I will be leading warriors down a path,” Tupoc said. “Be one of them and I will deliver to you the man whose death you seek.”

She bared her teeth.

“Only one of them,” Angharad told him.

“Greedy,” the Aztlan chided, more amused than offended. “But it seems you are not yet ready to bargain.”

“Nor will I ever be,” she replied.

After a curt nod she turned her back on him. In the wake of Lieutenant Wen’s oration most of the trial-takers had dispersed but there was nowhere to go save the great courtyard: none had gone all that far, beyond the distance courtesy dictated she be given for a private conversation. People clustered in pairs and small group, eyeing their fellows, but before Angharad could consider what she ought to do about this she found Isabel approaching her. The infanzona offered her soft smile and her arm with it.

“Walk with me,” Isabel Ruesta asked.

Who was Angharad to deny her? There was little to do but go around in circles in the courtyard if they did not want to leave the safety of the fort, so it was that they settled on.

“The second trial,” the dark-haired beauty told her, “is where most people are said to die. My family knows little about the Trial of Weeds, save that it ends in a port on the other side of the island, but it does not seem as dangerous.”

“Spirits are never to be trifled with,” Angharad agreed.

“We must make allies, then, else we will be at the mercy of others,” Isabel said, then paused.

The infanzona snuck a shy glance.

“That is, if you still want my company,” she said. “I would not presume, now that I have no guard left and only a single maid that-”

“Of course,” Angharad hurried to answer her. “You must know I would not abandon you now, Isabel, not when peril has reached its height and you are all but alone.”

“Thank you,” Isabel feelingly said. “Remund and Master Cozme are worthy friends, of course, but I cannot rely on them as I do you.”

“Cozme has his duty,” she conceded.

And it was Cerdan lives he was sworn to protect, not anyone from the House of Ruesta.

“The four of us – five, when Beatris recovers – make a respectable backbone for an expedition,” Isabel said.

“Five will not be enough,” Angharad replied.

Not when neither Isabel nor Beatris were any good at fighting.

“Then recruitment is in order,” the other woman agreed. “It would be best, I think, for you to take the lead in this.”

Angharad cocked an eyebrow.

“You might not have noticed, but your reputation rose to new heights after your battle with the Red Eye and their traitor allies,” Isabel told her. “Tupoc related how you faced an entire warband by yourself, when he arrived here, and that he believed you would live.”

The infanzona squeezed her arm.

“You will be sought after,” Isabel said. “Doors that would remain closed to me will open for you.”

Angharad frowned. Besotted she might be, but she could still see what lay behind what Isabel had said: the star of the infanzones was fading while her own had risen. On the Bluebell, Lord Remund and Isabel would have picked their allies and Angharad been expected to nod. Now the balance had swung the other way: it would be they who nodded, whatever her choices might be. That would take some getting used to. A lifetime of holding the least consequential title in every room had done little to prepare her, for all that Father had been readying her for the rule of Llanw Hall.

“Then I shall see about opening them,” Angharad replied with forced cheer.

After finishing another round of the courtyard they parted ways, Isabel reminding her that she was always there if Angharad felt the need for advice. By happenstance they had ended near an old acquaintance, which made the first step obvious enough for Angharad: Brun was kneeling by a bench, setting out his supplies and putting order to them. He was also, she saw, keeping a roving eye on the rest of the courtyard while working. He turned to her when she approached, slowly rising to his feet.

“Lady Angharad,” he said, pulling back at his sleeves. “Done talking with Ruesta, I see.”

A touch of embarrassment.

“It does make my purpose rather obvious, I suppose,” Angharad said.

“A tad,” Brun shrugged.

She did not make the request and he did not volunteer, which already told her all she needed to know about how the conversation would go if she did. It showed on her face and Brun passed a hand through his blond locks before grimacing.

“I would have liked to stick with you,” he admitted. “But I will not go with infanzones again, not after what it was like last time.”

“Augusto will not be with us,” Angharad said.

His lips thinned.

“And how much did his brother do, when Gascon got a knife in his back?” he asked. “Did Remund Cerdan try to help Briceida when she was taken, or run like a rabbit the moment he could?”

Brun had been fond of the redheaded maid. They had been courting, or near enough. Her death was not something he was taking lightly. Angharad looked away, ashamed that she had nothing to say. Neither of the Cerdans had covered themselves with glory on the Dominion of Lost Things.

“I hate that you must have that look on your face because of them,” Brun quietly said. “I don’t know what you are, Angharad Tredegar, but no infanzon is it. They will use you until you break, the same they do everything else, and after they’ll not shed a tear. It’s just what they are.”

“There is more to them than that,” Angharad said.

“Maybe,” Brun said. “Sometimes one man out of thousand does get rich riffling through the dung heap, it’s true. But even then, Angharad, all the rest just got shit on their hands.”

The phrasing was crude, but she understood the meaning: he was not going to take on the chance on either Remund or Isabel after what he had seen of them. It was, much as she disliked admitting it, entirely understandable. And it was not Brun’s duty to convince himself of the worth of the nobles ruling over him – if the sheep sought the shepherd’s crook, there would be no need for it, the High Queen had once said.

“I understand,” she said. “I wish it were otherwise, but what is that save noise?”

Brun worried his lip.

“I owe you for the way you drew the cultists off us,” the Sacromontan said. “I haven’t forgotten that.”

“I did not do it for reward,” Angharad dismissed. “We were companions, fighting to keep us alive is nothing more than what was owed.”

He looked frustrated, for reasons she did not understand.

“I don’t think the diving crews will stay the same,” Brun told her. “We can talk again after a day or two, see if there’s something to be done.”

She smiled, appreciating the intention more than a prospect she doubted would ever come to pass.

“I will still see you at camp,” Angharad told him. “We need not be strangers.”

“No,” he muttered. “I suppose not.”

“Then take care of yourself, Brun,” she said. “Perhaps the third trial will bring us side by side again.”

He jerked a nod, looking embarrassed.

“I’ll keep an eye out for you,” the Sacromontan promised. “See you around, Lady Tredegar.”

They parted ways with an undertone that was almost bittersweet. Angharad had spent only a few days with the companions she made on the Bluebell but the ties felt older than that. Thicker. She began to understand why it was that Mother said a captain who fought with her men need never fear mutiny. Facing death together was no small thing. Walking away as the blond man returned to his work, Angharad breathed out. Her crew lacked strength, she saw it plain. Brun had made his decision plain and she would not disrespect him by trying to convince him otherwise, which now left one name at the top of her list.

Song was cleaning her musket when the Pereduri approached her, carefully checking every part under lantern light.

“May I sit?” Angharad asked.

“There is no need,” Song replied without looking away from her weapon.

Angharad felt a sting of betrayal at the other woman’s words, however undeserved.

“Two more fighters,” the Tianxi continued. “If you want me to come along, that is what you need to secure. Anything less is throwing our lives away.”

She let out a breath or relief. Not a sundering of their relationship, then, but a requirement she could only call reasonable. Song owed none of their crew anything, certainly not her life.

“Will you desist from accepting other offers until then?” she asked.

“I will not go with Tupoc Xical,” Song said, tearing away her gaze from the musket only to look past her. “Anything else I will consider – waste no time, Angharad. The competition is not dallying.”

She turned to follow where the Tianxi was looking, seeing Lord Ishaan and Shalini Goel conversing with Lady Ferranda. Angharad pushed down her dismay. She had not thought Ferranda would be poached so quickly, half-hoping that after gathering more strength she could talk the other noble into coming with them despite her distrust of the other infanzones. By the way the blonde infanzona was nodding at the words of the other two, she would not have that opportunity. Teeth clenched, her gaze swept the courtyard for other possibilities. Tupoc was talking with the married pair, who displayed hesitant looks.

Even the desperate knew better.

Yong was speaking with Tristan and the toothless old professor. She was not sure the latter two would qualify as fighters in Song’s eyes, so she pushed that talk further down the ladder. Of those fit to fight a pair did stand alone: Lady Inyoni and her nephew Lord Zenzele. Angharad grimaced. She had avoided the Malani pair because of the man’s strange behaviour, thinking they might be assassins, but they had paid her no attention since the Bluebell docked. It seemed her suspicions had done them disservice. They were standing by the great iron gate, talking quietly as they beheld it, and Angharad made to join them.

“-er seen its like before,” Lord Zenzele was saying. “It must be some kind of stone from the far south.”

Her arrival was caught by the elder of the two.

“Lady Angharad,” Inyoni half-turned to greet her.

“Lady Inyoni,” she returned, then nodded at the nephew. “Lord Zenzele.”

The grizzled older woman snorted.

“My sister’s the one who got the title,” she said. “There is no need to spare me one as well, Tredegar.”

“Then you may take it as a mark of respect instead,” Angharad replied.

The older woman blinked in surprise. Her nephew seemed amused, though only shallowly. His eyes were as watchful of her now as when they had been on the ship.

“We’ve not much had the pleasure of your company, Lady Angharad, so forgive her for not knowing of your respect,” Zenzele wryly said. “Are you come to join in our wonder at this strange stone?”

She did not answer the unspoken reproach, for she had no good answer to it, and instead followed the other man’s invitation. Though the grand iron gate – not a simple slab of metal but a mass of intricate gears and mechanisms – was set into the massive pillar, the side and hinges were covered with a fine border in another kind of stone. It was deep blue, not unlike lapis in colour, but a simple rap of her knuckles confirmed her suspicion: it was soft stone, a kind she did know.

“This is Savuri marble,” she told them. “Polished.”

Lord Zenzele eyed her dubiously.

“You seem very sure of that,” he said.

“I had a piece in my bedchamber mere months ago,” Angharad amusedly told him. “A gift from my mother.”

Distaste flickered across the Malani’s face.

“Of course you did,” he scorned. “A least try a more believable lie, Tredegar. Who is your mother, then – Her Perpetual Majesty or Captain Maraire? The crown has a monopoly on Savuri marble and only Maraire ships may carry it. Every lord in Malan knows that, though perhaps word did not reach as far as Peredur.”

She met his scorn with a black stare.

“My mother’s name was Rhiannon Tredegar,” she replied, “though like all peers of Peredur she did have to register a Malani name on the rolls: Lady Sizani Maraire.”

She leaned forward.

“As for the piece of marble I refer to, it was the first ever dug up in Savuri after the colony was founded,” she coldly continued. “The High Queen was presented the second, you see, for its blue was deeper and it had a beautiful crack of gold going through it.”

Zenzele swallowed loudly. There was a long, awkward silence, then Inyoni let out snort.

“Well, you had that one coming,” the grizzled woman said. “You’ll have to forgive my nephew, Lady Tredegar, grief has addled his mood.”

At the reminder that the young woman with them was taken by the cultists, her expression sobered.

“I was very sorry to hear what happened to Ayanda,” she quietly said.

“We don’t know that she’s dead,” Zenzele said.

He sounded like a man trying to convince himself.

“Pray to the Sleeping God that she is,” Lady Inyoni flatly replied. “It is the kindest of the fates before her.”

The Malani clenched his fists.

“If Ishaan has just agreed to pursue, then-”

“Then we may well have lost more than one,” Inyoni sharply interrupted. “Or died at the bridge because he had already overused his contract.”

“You don’t know that,” Zenzele insisted. “And we’ll never know, because they fucking refused to try to rescue the reason I came to this fucking island in the first place.”

His voice was halfway to a shout by the end of the sentence and he was panting. Angharad did not need to look to know they were drawing attention but she could not bring herself to feel embarrassed, not looking at the raw grief on his face. It would been too petty.  Inyoni sighed, then turned an eye on her.

“I can guess at why you came to us, Lady Tredegar,” she said. “As you can see, we will not be making common cause with Ishaan Nair again.”

“I did seek you out to make alliance,” Angharad admitted, “but such talk can wait. I have disturbed you in your grief.”

Zenzele scoffed, though the anger did not feel directed at her.

“I’ll still be grieving her in fifty years, Tredegar – what difference could a few hours possibly make? Out with it.”

His bluntness bordered on rudeness, but patience came easy when she saw the look in his eyes. Much could be forgiven of a man when he had a knife in the belly.

“Crews are forming to delve into the maze,” Angharad said, matching frankness with frankness. “I would have the two of you in mine.”

Inyoni grunted, eyes considering.

“You’ve got the Ruesta dead weight and her maid, also dead weight, then the younger Cerdan – any truth to him having a contract?”

Angharad hesitated, then nodded. It was nothing they could not learn by asking around.

“Slightly better,” Inyoni conceded. “Cozme’s no slouch, but it’s not us he’ll be keeping an eye out for. Your roster is not a strong sell. Did you get that pretty blond boy or the Tianxi with the trick shots?”

“Song will join if you do,” Angharad said.

She could have turned a phrase to hide the detail, but why bother? It had been tiring, the game of twists and turns with the Cerdans, and she would gladly be rid of it. Best not to weave rope now she might later hang herself with. Inyoni met her nephew’s eyes, cocking an eyebrow, and Angharad knew her to be amenable. She would be, since they could not join the diving crew forming around Lord Ishaan and the other rising prospect was Tupoc. It was Lord Zenzele that looked unconvinced.

“You spent the entire trip to the island avoiding us,” Zenzele said. “What has changed?”

There she drew a line.

“Did you seek me out anymore than I sought you?” she evenly asked.

He conceded that with a grunt.

“I broke a betrothal to come here,” Lord Zenzele abruptly said. “With a house of no small means and a famously vengeful disposition. Keeping away from anyone come of the Isles seemed safer.”

On the ship, she recalled, his eyes had always been moving. Seeking out dark corners. It was why she’d thought he might be an assassin in the first place, and now the realization that he had been looking for the same knives she thought him to bear startled a laugh out of her. Zenzele’s face moved through surprise and then anger.

“I know not what-”

“I am the last of my house, save for my uncle in the Watch,” Angharad cut through. “I fled to Sacromonte pursued by assassins.”

She had not seen Father or her cousins die with her own eyes but there could be no doubt. The man’s face turned incredulous.

“You saw we were from Malan, and you thought…”

“Yes,” Angharad admitted.

“And we thought…”

“Yes,” Angharad repeated.

A moment passed, then Lord Zenzele let out a bitter chuckle.

“Sleeping God, that’s fucked,” he admitted. “Funny, in a horrible sort way.”

His aunt put a hand on his shoulder.

“We can band together,” Inyoni said. “But something must be made clear: we do not take orders from you, and certainly not from the infanzones. This is alliance, not servitude.”

“I would not ask otherwise,” Angharad told her. “It is all I have pledged.”

“Good,” Lady Inyoni said, then glanced at her nephew.

Zenzele let out a long breath, then nodded.

“We can deal,” he said. “If we had earlier, then…”

He grimaced.

“I could dig for a year and still find further mistakes were made,” the Malani said. “I will spare you the talk, Lady Tredegar. We will go fetch our packs and set them besides yours.”

As plain a statement about who they stood with as Angharad might ask for. It ought to be enough to convince Song, whose presence would turn their crew into a respectable force. The noblewoman nodded her thanks at the pair, watching as they left speaking in low voices. She allowed some of the tension to bleed out of her now that that they were no longer looking. Already her crew numbered eight, nearly a third of those who had made it to the Trial of Ruins, but she still felt vulnerable.

She stood there before the great iron gate, resisting the urge to fiddle with the buttons of her new vest as she wondered whether she should still be recruiting.

Soft footsteps on the stone had her glancing back, finding a familiar tricorn and crow’s nest. Tristan’s black eye was now a vivid purple, but the swelling had gotten better. As had the rest of him: not only had he clearly taken a bath but his most ragged clothes had been replaced. He now wore a black cloth kirtle over loose trousers tucked into a new pair of boots, the physician evidently having availed himself of the Watch’s stocks. There was even a pistol tucked into his belt, though Angharad could not ever remember seeing him fire a shot.

Though they had not parted on good terms and only reunited with complicating nuances, the grey-eyed man did not seem unfriendly. As he idly came to stand by her, facing the iron gate as well, Angharad came to suspect she was the only one feeling uncomfortable. It made her uneasy, to not know where the two of them stood. She had accused him, perhaps unjustly, and done so for reasons that now shamed her. Yet he did not seem to be keeping a grudge and had seen to her wounds when they encountered each other on the stairs to sanctuary.

Much as it embarrassed her to revisit their conflict Angharad knew it would be the only way to clear the air. Best to get it over with.

“I was wrong to accuse you after the twin died,” Angharad evenly said.

It was not an apology, she would not apologize for thinking he might have been involved when he had beaten the woman killed but a day before, but neither would she shy away from the fact that she had accused him for the wrong reasons. Feeling cheated by the good impression he had made on her and how harshly it had been revealed to be wrong was not an honorable reason to accuse him. She had been heeding the sting of her pride, not truly attempting to find out whether he had killed the Tianxi.

“I was the natural suspect,” Tristan acknowledged. “I imagine that’s half the reasons they aimed for Jun in the first place.”

Angharad shifted her footing, yet uneasy. It did not feel like anything had been resolved.

“I no longer believe you to have had a hand in it, whatever that is worth to you,” she offered.

That, at least, won a reaction.

“Tupoc Xical, is it?” the Sacromontan asked with half a smile.

“He was already scheming to offer us to the cultists,” Angharad said. “It seems consistent for him to have sown the seeds of us going our own way.”

“Our company came to the same conclusion while we ran,” Tristan told her. “And yet now I wonder.”

She started in surprise.

“It was only a matter of time until we split up, anyhow,” the Sacromontan continued, “so what did Xical truly gain?”

“He was most ardent in pushing fault towards you,” Angharad pointed out.

Not an uncommon thing for men to do when trying to avoid paying for their crimes.

“I’ll not deny he leapt at the opportunity to stir the pot,” he conceded. “But why do it when complete surprise would have served him even better? We would not have become suspicious of him so soon if not for Jun’s death.”

“If not him,” she asked, “then who?”

Tristan smiled at her, though it did not reach those grey eyes.

“I do not know, Lady Angharad,” he said. “And that worries me more than the thought of some gods in a maze, because those will not follow us past the Old Fort’s walls.”

The noblewoman was not convinced, but neither would she dismiss his suspicions out of hand. That he would be so caught up chasing shadows when he was said to have been fearless in front of a great monster like an airavatan was just one more confusing contradiction. She looked away, gaze going back to the iron gate.

“Some of the people here are easy to place,” Angharad finally said. “You, however, have been a discomforting man to try to fit anywhere.”

He cocked an eyebrow.

“I thank you for the compliment.”

It had been no such thing, they both knew.

“What did you do, Tristan, if I may ask?” she pressed. “I thought you a physician’s apprentice, but Ferranda calls you courageous and you wield a debt collector’s weapon as well as a knife.”

“I’ve never met someone who fit in a box without some parts first getting chopped off, Lady Angharad,” Tristan mildly replied. “As for my occupation, I did whatever would keep me fed that month. Some parts of that were pleasanter than others, as were the lessons the world doled out.”

Seeing her unconvinced expression, he sighed.

“Some of those months were spent serving as a cutter’s attendant,” Tristan said. “I have been a messenger boy, a dealer in stolen goods, a smuggler and a dozen other things that were never so neat as to be called a trade.”

A criminal, Angharad thought as her lips thinned. She had begun to suspect as much but it would have been a grave insult to assume. If this had been Peredur, if he had made the choice to break the law when there was a peer ruling over him and providing the opportunity of honest work, she would have held him in contempt. Only he was of Sacromonte, that rotting hive of a city, and how much choice did the souls in the belly of that beast really have? Angharad did not think she was wrong to try to place people but there was so much of the world that she had yet to see, to understand.

If a man did not fit in a box, she thought, the fault lay with the box and not the man.

“Did that ease your mind any?” he asked.

He sounded curious.

“The contrary, I think,” Angharad murmured. “But that might be for the best.”

To learn without discomfort was to fish only in shallow waters. She swallowed, dry-mouthed, then spoke impulsively.

“You could join us,” she said. “In the maze, I mean.”

Grey eyes considered her.

“I do not intend to venture out,” Tristan said. “Not for now, at least.”

She was not sure whether she was relieved or disappointed.

“You have done more fighting than most,” Angharad allowed. “Rest was earned.”

“That’s not why I want to stay here,” he smiled. “See, I’m not convinced that Lieutenant Wen told us the truth.”

She blinked.

“About the maze?”

“About this trial being anywhere as straightforward as the Trial of Lines,” he said.

He did not elaborate and she did not ask. Her path ahead was already set, and she could respect that the man had found his own even if she believed it would lead him nowhere. Tristan’s eyes remained on the great iron gate, never straying.

“What is it about it that interests you so?” Angharad asked. “It is the maze that will take us across, not the gate.”

The man cocked his head to the side.

“Those mechanisms on the gate, the moving parts,” he said. “What would you say they look like?”

Angharad blinked in surprise, then took her first careful look at it all. The iron gate must be fifty feet tall and about half as large, but it felt heavier for all the machinery it was laden with: cogs and gears and bands of metal, plaques fitted like a grid and so many pistons and interlocked pieces it was hard to tell where the mechanisms began or ended. She had seen some drawn schematics of First Empire wonders, as a girl – the famous towers of the Tower Coast, Izcalli candles and even the Broken Gate before the Triglau broke it – and the resemblance was striking.

“A lock,” she finally said.

“I thought that too, at first,” Tristan said.

“Not anymore?”

“Not anymore, no,” he agreed.

The grey-eyed man smiled.

“Right now, I’d say they look like clockwork.”

# Chapter 21

Angharad Tredegar walked away, leaving him to stand alone before the gate, and Tristan smiled.

That had worked out better than he’d hoped it might. The invitation to join her crew had come as a surprise to him – and to her as well, he suspected – but it told him his instincts had been correct. Tredegar liked for people to be good and bad, with little room in between, so now that he was not strictly bad her opinion of him was leaning the other way.

“That was nice of you,” Fortuna mused, chin resting on his shoulder as she held him tight.

A pause.

“So why did you actually do it?”

Tristan only kept smiling. That business with the airavatan had improved his reputation markedly, but while that may have some uses it also meant that his reputation was now worth something. It could therefore be used as leverage against him. So before Tupoc Xical came knocking with a smile and a threat to tell everyone that his medicine cabinet was truly a poisoner’s arsenal it was best to cut the grass under the Izcalli’s feet. Tredegar hated the man and was now likely to side with Tristan if he gave a halfway believable lie as answer, which would do away with most the damages.

Ferranda Villazur would keep her mouth shut about the lodestone extract, they had an understanding, and even if the remaining infanzones wanted to make something it they could not. Augusto was a muzzled dog, unable to do anything without his master’s permission, and the other two had to toe Angharad Tredegar’s line now. The mirror-dancer might not have noticed it but without her Remund Cerdan and Isabel Ruesta were fairly fucked.

Precious few people wanted to do anything with the Cerdan now that word had got around about one stabbing his own valet in the back and Isabel Ruesta was all but useless in a fight.

“Don’t you know I love making friends?” he lied.

Fortuna pressed her lips against the side of his neck and blew a staggeringly unpleasant raspberry in retaliation, which had him squirming enough he got a strange look from Inyoni. Fleeing the scene as the Lady of Long Odds’ laughter echoed behind him, he dipped by the kitchen table to help himself to one of the comforts the Watch had set out: a large steaming pot of what, by the smell, must be dandelion tea. He claimed a mug, thanked the watchman watching over the pot and proceeded to the next part of his plan.  

Finding a comfortable nook to sit in with his warm drink.

There he sat in silence, eyes unblinking, and began drawing a map. Not one of the maze, though in time there might be a need for that, but of something rather more important: crews.  The nature of mankind was that if you dropped thirty strangers into a pit with nothing but the clothes on their back, within an hour there’d be five factions and two of those would be looking for knives to pull on each other. It was simply how people were, no matter where they were born. Now the souls on display here were from all over Vesper and the lives that’d led them to this courtyard seemed just as disparate, so where they would fall was not easy to predict. This was not a curse, however, but a boon: looking at where people fell Tristan would be able to get some notion of what they actually wanted.

Take Ocotlan, for example. The large Aztlan legbreaker was sticking to Tupoc Xical and did not look like he’d ever considered otherwise even though he would be welcome in other crews. That was because Ocotlan most wanted to be on the same side of the beatings he was used to – namely, the one doling them out. The only one sure to deliver on that was Tupoc, who had all the restraint of the animal emblem of his former society. Now contrast the Menor Mano bruiser to the other survivor from Tupoc’s crew, Lady Acanthe Phos. Arguably the keystone of the Izcalli’s strategy in the Trial of Lines with her tracking contract. She now avoided getting anywhere near Tupoc, talking with the Ramayan pair like someone try to get an in.

That was because Acanthe Phos cared most about safety.

She’d been fine with Tupoc selling the rest of the Bluebell out if it made it any more likely for her to get to the second trial, but Tredegar has said he’d sold out one of their own – Leander Galatas, the sailor who’d lost his arm on the ship. In her eyes, Tupoc had turned from someone dangerous to others into a man dangerous to everyone. Including his own crew. So she was abandoning ship, and with Angharad Tredegar more likely to stab her than take her in the best bet for safety was the Ramayans. Ishaan Nair and Shalini Goel had already got their hands on Ferranda Villazur, an auspicious start.

Whether or not people realized it yet, they had begun to divide along the lines that Lieutenant Wen had implied: three shrines matched by three diving crews. Oh, for now it was more like half a dozen but Tristan had seen this sort of thing at work in the Murk. Small coteries – gangs – were fiercely independent when their corner of the mud went undisturbed, guarding their little kingdoms jealously, but that died the moment the bigger dogs came. When the Hoja Roja poked a nose in, all the petty kings swore brotherhood with the rivals they’d tried to kill a month ago and began talking about sticking together in the face of encroachment.

It was the same here, in a sense. The maze would do the work of convincing the smaller crews to let the larger ones eat them, until only a handful of forces broadly in the same league were left standing. Even if the knowledge of the horrors out there did not turn out to be enough today, then tomorrow the balance would tip: once bodies began dropping that strange sickness called tolerance for your fellow men had a way of spreading around. Tristan couldn’t be sure, not yet, but after watching for about half an hour he believed he’d figured out the three kingdoms that would end up the victors.

“So, what are we looking at?” Fortuna asked.

She sat above him to his left, in a broken cleft of stone: the blood-red dress dripped down to the dusty floor, long past her feet, as she rested her chin on the palm of her hand. She looked bored at a glance but Tristan knew better. She had always liked watching people, especially ‘interesting’ sorts, and many here qualified for the word in her eyes. He smiled and hid his mouth behind the rim of his cup.

“If we’re naming crowns, Tredegar is the easy one,” he said. “She’ll end up with the largest crew too, mark my words.”

Not that she had made it easy on herself. Given her record on the Bluebell and the rumours now going around that she’d single-handedly cut through a cultist warband before fighting Tupoc Xical to a draw, there was not a single individual here who would turn down an alliance with her. Not even Tristan himself, had he intended to delve the maze.

“She looks a little harried,” Fortuna observed.

“That’s because the leeches put her in charge,” he said. “Not that they had a choice.”

Tredegar’s trouble was that she had inherited a pack of parasites from the first trial: Isabel Ruesta, the smarter of the Cerdan brothers and Cozme Aflor. Though not Beatris, whose absence was glaring. Still, that early inheritance had raised Tredegar’s numbers from the start but come at a cost in that everyone not a fool knew the infanzones would sacrifice them without hesitation if it kept them alive even a minute longer. Not the kind of company you wanted to keep in a maze full of deadly tests. Even in the face of that, though, Tredegar was picking up recruits.

First came Inyoni and Zenzele Duma, the survivors of the Malani threesome from the Bluebell. Lord Zenzele had been looking all this time like he was either about to weep or bite someone’s head off, not the stuff solid allies were made of, and both he and his aunt were avoiding the Ramayans they’d come with – though not Yaretzi, the quiet Aztlan who once again glided through peril without drawing attention. Tredegar was the only safe port of call for the Malani, so she had hooked them without much trouble. With that many fighters on her side, she would now be able to pick up another member or two without nearly as much difficulty.

The more there were under Tredegar, the less the infanzones were a millstone around her neck.

“Tupoc’s one too,” Fortuna decided. “He’s already got two.”

Tristan drank, then hid his lips again.

“His will be the weakest,” the thief said. “He keeps Ocotlan and Augusto Cerdan has nowhere else to go, but it is only the desperate he will draw.”

His reputation was too blackened for anything else, no matter how skilled the man was at fighting. People going to Tupoc would know they’d be treated as expendable, so those who went anyway would do so for lack of a better crew to fall in with. Tristan suspected that Angharad Tredegar might well accept every fearful soul pleading to hide in her shadow, but her comrades would not be as accommodating. They would not tolerate useless hanger-ons trailing them in the maze while they faced all the perils.

“He’s getting Felis and Aines, at the very least,” Tristan said. “Perhaps Francho as well.”

He would have said as much even if the pale eyed Izcalli were not currently speaking to Felis, whose shoulders were hunched even though he was the one being sought out.

“It’s the Ramayans that intrigue,” he continued. “Their position is the most interesting.”

Lord Ishaan Nair and his right hand, Shalini Goel – who was visibly the most assertive of the two but still deferred to the nobleborn of the pair – were in the right spot to have some ripe fruits fall straight into their lap: anyone who did not want to work with the infanzones but could not stomach Tupoc Xical. They’d marked themselves as that option by recruiting Ferranda Villazur bright and early, forming a neat bundle of firepower and competence that everyone must eye with consideration. On the other hand, they’d failed to retain a single comrade from the first trial. The Malani survivors pointedly avoided them and Yaretzi had made herself scarce despite what Tristan believed to have been an attempt by Shalini to rope her in.

There was a mistake buried somewhere in their wake, and if the thief had to bet he’d say it had to do with the missing Malani. Ayanda, had it been? Tredegar had mentioned the Red Eye cult taking her with Tupoc’s help but there must have been more to it than that. Considering how unmoored Zenzele Duma acted and how closely he and Ayanda had kept together on the Bluebell, the thief had some suspicions about where things might have gone wrong. It also told him that Inyoni’s nephew had cared more about Ayanda than about passing these trials.

That might end up useful to know, before everything was over.

“They’re picking up Phos,” Fortuna replied with open distaste. “That seems more desperate than interesting.”

“No, it is very clever,” Tristan disagreed. “It’s not about if she is useful now, it is about opening a door.”

“For other traitors?” the goddess asked. “The big man won’t drop Tupoc and they wouldn’t want the rest.”

“It is about the precedent,” the thief said. “Acanthe Phos acted against others, treacherously so, but she was still taken in.”

“So they’re forgiving,” Fortuna shrugged.

“Oh yes,” Tristan murmured behind the cup. “And when tomorrow or the day after someone in Tredegar’s group cuts an ally’s throat to live and flees our honourable friend’s company, there is another home for them aside from Tupoc Xical’s collections of bastards and sacrifices.”

Even if all Acanthe Phos ended up being was a warm body with a sword when they walked the maze, her real value was in what her presence represented. The thief suspected he would enjoy a conversation with whichever of the Ramayans had come up with the scheme. A shame that even when he ventured out it would not be with their crew, as the men he intended to kill were among Tupoc and Tredegar’s followers. Draining the last of his dandelion tea, long gone from lukewarm to cold, Tristan set down the cup. Fortuna gracefully leapt down from her perch, dress trailing behind her as she adroitly came to stand before him.

“So, who are we joining?” Fortuna cheerfully asked.

Tristan rolled his neck, getting up with a sigh.

“First,” he said, “we begin by rigging the dice.”

And that meant dealing with a fellow rat.

—

“Smile,” Tristan suggested. “We are having a pleasant conversation.”

Lan beamed at him, tugging at her grey tunic as she tittered.

“What is it you’ve come to sell me, rat?” the dealer smilingly asked.

“I want us to run a game,” the thief replied just as smilingly.

She laughed, lightly slapping his arm like he’d just told a joke. Tristan rather admired the work: it’d taken him years to learn to laugh at will and he still didn’t look anywhere as convincing as the former Meng-Xiaofan frontwoman.

“Who on?”

“Everyone,” he said. “This maze is meant to keep us looking forward. It-”

“- splits us up so one can have a good look at the whole and figure out what this show’s really about, yes,” Lan impatiently said. “Obviously. You think I don’t know a front when I see one? The Watch is better trained at keeping secrets with knives than tricks.”

It was Lan writ in a sentence that her talent for seeing through things was just a little more useful than it was worrying.

“We split up across the crews,” he said.

“And share information back at the fort,” she mused.

It was hard to read what she thought of it, as Lan then let out a chuckle like they were having fun.

“You’re going to get Yong in under the Ramayans,” the blue-lipped woman decided. “He’s the best fit. So you want me to join up with Tupoc.”

“You won’t be alone, he’s taking Felis and Aines,” Tristan pointed out. “Fear’s a fine leash but it won’t beat your supply of dust.”

“I don’t need you to use it, Tristan,” Lan said. “And you’d be taking the nice cushy job by going with Tredegar.”

He shook his head.

“I won’t go with them,” he said. “I mean to trade with Beatris for that.”

 Lan’s brow rose.

“I have not seen her since I got here,” she said. “Not even for meals.”

“I’ll find her,” Tristan shrugged.

It was not so large a fort he would struggle to if he put his mind to it. Lan studied him for a moment, then let out a low whistle.

“So it’s the Watch you’re thinking of spying on,” she said, looking him up and down. “Look at the balls on you.”

He did not deny it, which killed any talk of him taking the lesser risk. In truth, for all that she was posturing Lan was short on choices. She had no in with Tredegar’s crowd and was not useful enough for Ferranda Villazur to vouch for her and get her under the Ramayans. Her way out would be tying herself to someone who was useful and coming as a package deal, but that would be tricky to manage and she had no obvious candidate. She might well end up stuck with Tupoc anyway, they both knew, and without the benefits of having accepted the terms he was offering.

“I want protection from everyone that’s brought into this,” Lan finally said. “It could turn sour on me.”

Tristan nodded.

“Then you must offer the same,” he said.

A symbolic gesture if it came to a brawl, but that was not where Lan’s strengths lay. She nodded back then brightly smiled.

“Now we need to sell it,” she said. “You demanded a fuck in exchange for protection?”

It was, he thought, telling that she would suggest that first. The Meng-Xiaofan did not deal in flesh-peddling, but that was business. Inside the coterie’s own ranks… The sisters had been twins, too. That would draw some sorts. He let no pity touch his gaze, for there was none of that to be had under the Law of Rats: it was for finer folk than they to extend the boundary of victory beyond survival.

“I don’t,” he simply said.

She did not comment aside from a blink of surprise. He considered for a moment.

“You asked for the relic pistol back, now that I have another weapon,” he said. “I refused.”

“Do you even have the scraps left?” she asked.

He shrugged. He did not, he’d thrown the useless weight away, but what did it matter? Even if someone thought to sneak into his pack and look she could simply say she had not believed him. After a moment she nodded, conceding to the unspoken answer. They both shifted their footing, turning to face each other properly, and mirth was replaced on her face by black anger. She slapped him, hard enough the sound carried, and said something that sounded like ‘she died for it’ before striding away angrily. Ignoring the many eyes now on him, Tristan cradled his stinging cheek and sighed.

She’d put her back into the slap knowing he’d have to let her away with it.

He first busied himself returning his cup to the makeshift kitchen, keeping an eye out for the people he needed to have a talk with now. Yong was not hard to find, and looked rather amused when their gazes met, but there was no sign of Sarai. A few others were missing as well, gone to talk or rest out of sight – Yaretzi, Brun, Song. And Beatris, of who there was still no sign. That was beginning to worry him. He went to sit by Yong, who had claimed one of the tables around the kitchen to clean his musket and pistol.

Given how many people were doing that, Tristan began to wonder if he should as well.

“Should I ask what you did to deserve that?” the Tianxi asked.

However sly the smile, it did not quite hide the slight slur to the words. He’s drunk. Too drunk for this conversation? Tristan decided not, after an appraising look. For now it was only slurring. The closest person to them was Remund Cerdan, who was at a table on the other side of the kitchen and eyeing Tredegar speaking animatedly with Zenzele Duma and Isabel Ruesta. The look on his face was somewhere between hate and desire, both dark enough that Tristan shivered in disgust. Still, the two of them should be safe to talk without being overheard.

“The same thing I am about to ask you,” the thief replied. “Have you given thought to which crew you want?”

“We agreed to stick together for the second trial,” Yong evenly said. “I have had offers but accepted nothing.”

“Ishaan Nair?” Tristan asked.

“Goel did the talking for them,” the former soldier replied. “Xical tried as well, but he can burn.”

“You should take Shalini’s offer,” the thief said.

Yong stared at him a long moment, frowning. The drink slowed his thoughts some but not all the way.

“Me,” he slowly said, “but not you. Are you ending our alliance?”

Surprise, Tristan thought, and perhaps a hint of hurt. He shook his head.

“No,” he murmured. “See, Lan took my offer. She slapped me so-”

“Xical wouldn’t think twice about taking her in,” Yong muttered, now caught on. “You’re trying to plant spies in the diving crews.”

His eyes narrowed.

“Or saboteurs.”

“No point in that,” Tristan dismissed. “There’s something off about this trial, Yong. And I do not think that going into that maze like good little soldiers is going to help us find out what’s really going on – at least not if that’s all we do.”

“That is dangerous talk,” the veteran warned. “You think the rooks will just let you sniff around?”

“I think that there’s a telescope set up on one of the bastions, with more astronomy equipment,” Tristan replied. “And that not knowing why is more likely to get me killed than trying to find out.”

Yong hesitated.

“I need to get to the third trial,” he finally said.

Tristan breathed in sharply. It was not quite a refusal, but close enough. He would have liked to say that it surprised, that he had not been sloppy enough to expect agreement, but it would be a lie. And it was unfair to do this when the man had drunk, but when if not now?

“Why did they send you here, Yong?” Tristan asked. “What do they have on you?”

The Tianxi’s face closed and his hand twitched, like he wanted to reach for his flask but had stopped himself. Only the aborted gesture wasn’t an answer, not really.

“You like a drink,” Tristan acknowledged, “but if it had eaten you alive you wouldn’t be able to fight like you do – or shoot, or run. Did you kill someone?”

“That is not a small question,” Yong said.

It was not, and rats paid upfront.

“I did,” Tristan admitted. “Someone on contract for the Hoja Roja, a Watch deserter. I didn’t set out to but it happened – and after that it was either the Dominion or getting my hands chopped off before they hung me upside down.”

Rios llorando, they called it. The weeping rivers. It didn’t take too long to die, not like some of the other ways coteries killed you, but they would hang you from up high so the red got everywhere. It was impossible to miss, which was what the Hoja cared most about: making an example. Reminding everyone that raising hands against them would cost the hands and then see you spill out everything inside you until there was nothing left at all.

Yong breathed in deeply, then rested a hand on the back of his head. Cursing in Cathayan, he reached for the inside of his coat and got his flask out. His fingers trembled as he undid the cork, taking a long swallow.

“I am surprised there is any left,” Tristan frankly said.

It did not smell like herbera, either, which had been all but finished anyhow.

“I brought three,” the Tianxi said.

The thief cocked an eyebrow. He’d seen the man drink often and smelled it even more frequently on his breath.

“And bought refills in their garrison rotgut,” Yong admitted.

The touch of levity was too light to really do more than skitter at the edge of their mood. Yong took his time, almost beginning to talk several times before closing his mouth. He drank twice more.

“Before leaving Caishen,” he said, “I stabbed a general five times.”

Tristan choked. He had not been sure what to expect, but it had not been that.

“I’d won decorations after the killing fields at Diecai,” Yong abruptly said. “They sent us across the plain, Tristan, with the Kuril cannons reaping us like wheat. I wanted to run, like anyone else, but we were halfway through and I knew the cannons wouldn’t stop firing just because we routed – so after a shot took off Old Rong’s head, I picked up the standard and told them to keep moving forward.”

Yong set his hands on the table, finger splayed against the wood, and glared down until they ceased shaking.

“And they trusted me, after our years together, so they did. General Qi sent four thousand men charging across the field at Diecai, all Caishen militia,” he said. “About half survived. The wings routed, but the center held and I was right in the middle of it.”

He let out a bleak, ugly laugh.

“My company had it worse because we didn’t rout,” Yong said. “They turned the full batteries on us so we’d break, ignored the runners.”

He breathed out, slowly, as if he were forcing out a ghost.

“We never reached their lines,” he said. “The battle was over before that. We’d been a distraction, see. Meant to rout and draw the Kuril regulars down the hills in pursuit so the mercenaries hidden in the woods could hit the left flank and flip their battle line.”

“But you didn’t rout,” Tristan quietly said.

“And didn’t end up mattering a fucking thing,” Yong said with cold fury. “The Kuril cavalry was out sacking a village an hour away instead of watching the left flank, so when the mercenary captains saw there were no guards and the enemy was watching the plain they attacked without waiting for the signal – took them completely by surprise, routed the entire army right off the field.”

Oh, Tristan thought, for words failed him.

“The greatest victory against an imperial army in thirty years,” the Tianxi said. “General Qi was the finest general in all the Republics, they told us, the most brilliant military mind of her generation.”

“So you killed her,” the thief said.

“It took two years to get close enough,” Yong said. “But she liked to keep us militiamen close because we’d been such an important part of her victory. Called us her bravest men, the backbone of Caishen. She liked to promote us when she could, make a show of it and have a meal between ‘just us veterans’ afterwards.”

The Tianxi grasped at the back of his head, avoiding the bun, as if he wanted to pull off hair.

“I wasn’t planning to kill her, at first,” he said. “But every night I dreamt about that fucking charge, Tristan, and when I got promoted to sima – major – she recognized my name. ‘This man,’ she said right in front of all those green boys, kids that’d never even been anywhere a battle and didn’t know she was lying, ‘this man won me Diecai,’ she said. ‘My grand plan would have come to nothing if not for the bravery of the Caishen militia’.”

Yong smiled.

“So when we sat for dinner, after the servant set down the roast duck I got up to carve it and shoved that knife right in her fucking throat,” he said, almost dreamily. “I kept stabbing until she stopped moving. Didn’t think I’d get out alive, after, but no one went in the tent for half an hour and by then I’d already stolen a horse.”

He drank again, licking his lips after.

“I got to Mazu before the news did,” he said. “I’d ridden that horse to death, then stolen another. Immediately bought a berth on a ship to Tenoch with the last of my coin.”

The former soldier met Tristan’s eyes, smiling sadly.

“And the dreams they stopped, for a time,” Yong said. “I did killing for bad men, enough to earn a decent living, and when some Caishen folk came asking around about a deserter I bought passage to Sacromonte. I was smiling when I did, though, you know? Tenoch had always felt too close, but on a ship to the City I felt free.”

“But it didn’t last,” the thief said.

“I thought it wouldn’t, deep down, but it did. I went clean in Sacromonte,” Yong told him. “No more bladework, not even for the Guardia. I bounced around jobs at the docks for a bit until I found a genuine Fuxing teashop in Old Town. I knew the brewing and the ceremonies – my grandmother was Sanxing stock, she taught me everything – and they felt that having someone born back in the old country added authenticity.”

“And you kept your nose clean as a host in a teashop?” Tristan asked, almost skeptical.

Yong shrugged.

“Dusted off my sword once when the Meng-Xiaofan came sniffing around, trying to make us a storehouse for butterfly powder, but I didn’t even need to use it,” he smiled. “It’s where I met my husband – Pietro was mad for white tea, came every week for a ceremony. He was younger than me, more than a decade, but neither of us cared. And things were good, they really were.”

It was, he thought, a pretty story. But Yong was here now and so the thief already knew the end would not be.

“It was my sister-in-law that was the start of it,” he said.

A pause.

“It wasn’t her fault, I don’t mean to say that,” Yong continued. “She’d borrowed some money from a lender when her husband broke his leg, to tide over until he got back to work, but when she returned to pay it was her the lender wanted. He invented some lie about the terms, said she had to pay with her body. She put him off and her husband beat the lender soundly when his leg got better. Knocked him out and left the coin owed. That should have been the end of it.”

“But he had coterie friends,” Tristan said, and it wasn’t much of the guess.

The coteries had their hands all over the moneylenders of Sacromonte, save those run by the infanzones themselves.

“A brother,” Yong said. “Some middling crew called the Mice Men. They sent three to break his other leg and told him if his wife didn’t go to ‘pay back the trouble’ next time they’d slit his throat.”

The thief winced. The smaller coteries were touchy about reputation, sometimes even more so than the real players. They knew they wouldn’t get anywhere if people weren’t afraid of them. Still, it was bold of these Mice Men to try such a thing outside the Murk. The Guardia actually cared what happened in the Old Town. Not as much as the Orchard, where the infanzones and the wealthy lived, but the Old Town made up most of Sacromonte’s districts and the crucial section of the canals that were its lifeblood. The redcloaks did not hesitate to shut down coteries that made trouble in that part of the city.

“That was overstepping,” Tristan said. “The Guardia didn’t get involved?”

“They brought in the lender for a talk, but there was no proof and he bought his way out,” Yong said. “Said he was being framed because we didn’t want to pay what was owed. Those two were terrified the Mice Men would take revenge for snitching and Pietro was the one who convinced them to tell the redcloaks, so he felt responsible.”

“And you felt responsible for him,” the thief said.

“That’s what love is, Tristan,” Yong sadly smiled. “Taking part. So I oiled my sword, cleaned my pistol and went to live with them for a few weeks.”

It was easy enough to tell what had followed.

“How many came?”

“Four,” the Tianxi said. “The lender was with them.”

He paused.

“I shot him in the belly,” Yong mused. “Never did learn if he died from that. But his brother went wild after so I had to kill him up close, sword to knife, and then another from behind when he tried to take a hostage. They ran after that, never came back.”

Yong drank.

“Until that night, I had not killed in over ten years.”

“And the dreams came back,” Tristan softly said.

“I couldn’t sleep a full night anymore,” Yong murmured. “Kept waking up screaming, charging across that fucking field at Diecai with all my friends dying and General Qi right behind me smiling a skull’s grin. Like she’d finally caught up.”

He pulled at the flask again, but it was empty.

“They warned me at the teashop that I looked too tired,” he said. “It put people off. We tried everything, Tristan, but I only found one thing that let me sleep.”

The Tianxi stared down at the flask, then flicked a finger against it. It let out a tinny ring, empty for now. But not for long, Tristan thought.

“Started just before bed,” Yong said. “Like medicine. But it didn’t stop there, and it got… well, you don’t need to know the details. We argued a lot. Pietro said I wasn’t the man he’d married.”

The former soldier grimaced.

“He wasn’t wrong.”

They were already past the crest of the hill, Tristan thought. Down was the only way for this to go.

“Money wasn’t great,” Yong admitted. “I got demoted to the back after smelling like rum before a ceremony, which paid less, and their family shop had to change suppliers after the old one died – prices were higher, profits slimmer.”

He flicked a finger against the flask again, the sound like the ringing of a bell.

“We had to borrow to keep the house, we were months behind in payments,” the Tianxi said. “I took care of it: the Hoja Roja needed a man dead and I did the killing, so they lent us without interest.”

Of course they did, Tristan thought. You’re everything they want in an enforcer: you need them more than the other way around, you have plain weaknesses and you’re a trained soldier. They would have kept handing him rope again and again, waiting patiently until a leash came from it they would be able to pull. Even drunk, the rotgut deep in him now, Yong saw that thought plainly writ on his face.

“They were looking to bring me in, I think,” he admitted, then looked away. “I’m not sure I was going to refuse, not that it ever got to that.”

And now the ugly end. Yong’s dark eyes were fervent when they returned to him.

“I don’t blame him, I want you to understand that,” he said. “I’m forty-three, Tristan. He’s only thirty, he still has years ahead of him. So I don’t blame him for taking the money and running.”

Tristan’s heart clenched.

“But it was the Hoja’s money,” he quietly said.

“But it was the Hoja’s money,” Yong quietly agreed.

What came out of the Tianxi’s throat could not be considered a laugh: it was just a convulsion barren of joy.

“They found him in three days,” Yong said. “Of course they did. What does he know about hiding? And then they told me they’d forgive the whole thing, if I put the shot in his head myself. Water under the bridge.”

“You didn’t,” Tristan said.

And there was much of that story that he had never believed a man like Yong might do, but that much he did not doubt.

“I love him,” Yong smiled. “How could I? So instead I made them a deal.”

And suddenly it made sense.

“That’s your red game,” Tristan sharply breathed in. “If you get to the third trial, they write off the money. They spare him.”

The other man toasted him with an empty flask.

“So I have to get there, Tristan,” he said. “Whatever it might cost me – or anyone else – I will reach the Trial of Weeds. I owe my husband that much.”

You owe him nothing, the thief thought. He ran, and that makes him one of my lot: there can be nothing owed under the Law of Rats.

“I understand,” he said instead.

“No,” Yong said, “I don’t think you do.”

He grimaced.

“I’ll help,” he said, “because it could be what I need. I’ll go with the Ramayans, who I liked most as a choice anyhow. But the moment this plan of yours looks as if it might keep me away from the third trial…”

“You turn on me,” Tristan completed. “You tell them everything.”

Who ‘them’ was did not matter. It could be the Watch, it could be the Ramayans or Tredegar of even Tupoc Xical. It would be whatever kept Yong safe so he would reach the Trial of Weeds, nothing more or less. It was a bittersweet thing, that in the same moment he came to understand the kind of man Yong was Tristan would come to understand that there was a limit to how far they could share trust. But having said this at all, the thief thought, was a kind of gift. Even if the Tianxi was drunk. Because he had not held back the secrets but instead given them out as a warning, so that Tristan might not overstep so much that betrayal must ensue.

“I’m sorry,” Yong quietly said, the slur thickening the words. “But it is what it is.”

Tristan straightened his back.

“Don’t be,” he said. “You promised all that you are free to promise. Asking anything more of you would be greed.”

And he meant it, he did, but looking at the pathetic gratitude in Yong’s eyes – what the drink was making of a man he respected – he had to look away. The bottle killed as many as sickness, down in the Murk. In some ways it was one. There was a reason Tristan never drank unless forced.

“We’ll talk before you leave,” the thief said.

Yong snorted, then waved him away.

“Go,” he said. “It won’t get any prettier.”

Tristan did not know what he would have answered, but he bit down on it anyhow. It was not his place to speak down to a man decades his senior, one who had lived through horrors he could not begin to imagine. Besides, that was one thing the bottle shared with sickness: once it was in your bones, it was not for you to decide when it left. Some got through it, got out, but most got ridden all the way down into the grave.

Tristan left with everything he’d come to get, but somehow it did not feel like a victory at all.

# Chapter 22

Tristan began fiddling with his cabinet like there was a point to it, keeping his hands occupied so he wouldn’t have to think about what he had just walked away from.

When he saw her approaching from the corner of his eye, it was almost a relief. Shalini Goel was the shortest of all the trial-takers, barely five feet five by his guess, and though she was full-bodied the thief could tell it was not the result of idleness: there was muscle to her frame and calluses on her palms. The same kind Guardia sometimes got, those come from shooting regularly. Her black hair was long, kept in a braid going down her back, and she had a gold ring in her nose. The vivid shades of her clothes spoke of coin even for a Ramayan, a people whose love of colour was proverbial.

A green kurta – the collarless tunic in the Someshwar manner – ended above her knees, leading into striped trousers in white and yellow that were tucked into high boots. A blood red sash at her waist had two pistols tucked into while a leather bandoleer holding powder horns hung loose across her torso, connecting a shoulder to the opposite side. Shalini had the look of a soldier but did not hold herself like one, which spoke to Tristan of someone who had been trained but not taken to such a life.

And while he’d been studying her, he realized, she had studied him right back.

“Tristan, is it?” she smiled. “I don’t believe we have been properly introduced.”

She had an easy smile, he decided, but it was not false. Shalini Goel struck him instead as one of those strange people Vesper had blessed with a general enjoyment of life. It must make her easy to like.

“It felt like a long journey here, but it ended up being so little time hasn’t it?” Tristan smiled back, entirely practiced.

She offered her hand to shake, which he did. Her grip was firm.

“I am-”

“Shalini Goel,” he said, then shrugged at her raised eyebrow. “Word gets around.”

“I suppose it does,” she chuckled. “And you even pronounced it right. Do you-”

Shalini said something he did not understand in what he was pretty sure was Samratrava – the most common of the Someshwari languages. Tristan answered with the only sentence in that language he had ever learned.

“The brothels are down the canal with red lanterns,” he informed her.

A flicker of complete and utter surprise, then Shalini burst out laughing. It was contagious enough that he found himself smiling as she slapped her knee, holding her stomach.

“Oh gods,” the Ramayan wheezed. “I guess that’s an answer. How much did they pay you to tell the sailors?”

“Only three radizes a night, but it came with a meal,” Tristan said.

He saw her pause, count in her head as she translated from the currency Sacromonte and most of the Trebian Sea used to coinage she better knew. The Imperial Someshwar had a few but jala – sheshajala, in truth, but not even Someshwari used the full name – were the only one he’d ever seen used at the docks. The private currencies of the rajas were rarely accepted, given how regularly they got debased when the latest palace or campaign got a little too expensive.

“So not even two kupah,” she mused. “I hope it was a good meal.”

“I’ve had worse,” the thief shrugged.

And taking the coppers had given him a reason to hang around Caballo Canal at night, letting him track the coming and goings of a Meng-Xiaofan warehouse he had been sent by Abuela to rob.

“I expect you have,” Shalini said, mood losing some of the humour. “It seems to have hardened you in useful ways.”

It was his turn to cock an eyebrow at her. She was the one who had come to him, after all, so it was her who should make the pitch.

“Tredegar is being run by the infanzones,” Shalini Goel told him, “and we both know Xical’s worse than a snake. A Leopard Society man through and through.”

“I have never heard of them before,” the thief admitted.

“I wouldn’t expect a Sacromontan to have,” she said. “Izcalli name their societies after animals from their homeland that embody traits they want to emulate, Tristan, but there are no leopards in the Kingdom of Izcalli.”

Tristan blinked in surprise.

“They’re not a formal society,” Shalini said. “When forced to acknowledge their existence the Grasshopper King will say they’re charged with hunting criminals that flee outside Izcalli borders, but what they really do is raid.”

She spat to the side.

“They go out with the candle-priests, hit undefended villages out in the Someshwar or the Republics and bring them back like cattle,” Shalini said.

He grimaced in disgust, not faking it in the least.

“For the candles?”

She nodded and he almost spat as she had. The Kingdom of Izcalli had been one of the strongest nations to emerge from the fall of the Second Empire, with fertile heartlands full of Antediluvian wonders and its strong military bent, but its unification was a bloody business. Izcalli was hardly alone in that, but what set the kingdom apart was that it was heavily dependent on First Empire lights to live and almost all of them were on the ground instead of set in firmament. During the wars many were damaged, which had unbalanced the intricate system of devices regulating light in Izcalli. Entire regions had begun to go dark for weeks, months even.

Until the men now known as the candle-priests found their solution: feed the machines aether where they grew weak.

Nowadays Izcalli claimed the era of bloody sacrifices, of murdering men on altars to keep the lights from burning out, was long past. That it had been much exaggerated anyhow, a very rare happenstance, and that advances in modern understanding of aether now made such savagery obsolete. There were kinder ways to keep the ‘candles’ lit, needing no death and hardly any pain. It had not stopped flower wars from erupting at Izcalli borders, and such assurances from the Grasshopper Kings were taken with a heavy grain of salt. With good reason, if Shalini spoke the truth about the Leopard Society.

“They’re expendable,” the Ramayan said. “If they get caught, become an embarrassment, they will be called rogues or bandits and left to hang. Xical came by that ugliness honestly, whatever else may be said of him.”

“And there is much to be said,” Tristan drily replied.

“Figured you’d agree,” Shalini grinned. “You can see the same things I can: Ishaan and I, we’re your best bet.”

He smiled at her, saying nothing.

“That Yong comes with is another point in your favour,” she acknowledged, “but after the way Lady Ferranda talked you up I would have made an offer anyway.”

“You,” he said, “and not Lord Ishaan. I find that interesting.”

“It’s not a slight,” Shalini assured him, “it’s just that he’s a little scrambled at the moment. By now you’ll have heard we ran into the airavatan before you did.”

“And that a contract was used to buy enough time for your crew to escape,” Tristan said.

Ferranda Villazur had claimed that something stupefied the beast long enough for them to run away. That it was contract work was not in doubt and he had already suspected it was Ishaan, but to hear it confirmed made the guess solid.

“There was some backlash,” she said. “Hard not to, beating back a monster that large. But he’s nearly through it and will be back to form by tomorrow. He’s just, uh, going to get confused easily until then. It’s best for me to do the talking while he recovers.”

She paused.

“If your worry is that I make promises he won’t keep, there is no need,” Shalini reassured him. “He’s not insensate, it just takes a while for him to understand things – everything I say, I say with his approval.”

It was tempting to keep stringing her along, see if he could get any more information out of her, but that was greed talking. If he took too much before declining, he would be salting the grounds. Best to end this now and add a little sweetness so they remained on good terms.

“It is a tempting offer,” he said.

“But,” Shalini said.

“I won’t be going into the maze tomorrow,” Tristan said. “Not with anyone.”

She drummed her fingers against the side of a pistol.

“Hedging your bets is not unreasonable,” she grudgingly said. “And we have had longer to rest.”

But it was not the answer she had wanted – and perhaps even expected – so now for the sweetness.

“Yong will not refuse if you ask him again,” Tristan said. “He does not want to wait.”

Shalini eyed him with interest.

“Is that what you two were speaking about?”

“We are inclined to different strategies,” Tristan shrugged.

She would come out of it with another shot at a companion she had wanted more than he, but more important still she would come out of their conversation with the feeling that she had ‘won’. Getting her hands on a source of tension between he and Yong was worth more than some talk about a suspected contract and idle conversation about the Leopard Society. Their conversation remained genial and Tristan suspected she might have stayed longer if she had not caught sight of something: Brun was approaching Ishaan Nair. Shalini made her excuses quickly after that, going to join them.

That’s another one for their crew, then, the thief thought. Brun was fit, loyal – he had backed Tredegar against Tupoc – and came with no baggage attached. He was, in essence, a perfect replacement for Yaretzi. Like her the blond Sacromontan had made few waves and come out of the perils with a solid reputation. And that made Tristan uncomfortable, because Fortuna had called the god he was bound to loud. It did not necessarily follow that a contractor must be alike in nature with their contracted – he had little enough in common with Fortuna – but a loud god ought to be loud in their gifts yet no a single whisper had spread of Brun’s contract.

The other man had navigated the game of alliances with a deft hand: he’d gotten in with the infanzones when the getting was good through the more influential of Isabel Ruesta’s maids, then stuck closely to Tredegar. A woman who would bite her own arm off before raising a hand against a comrade, a category Brun had made certain to fit in. Now he was changing ship for the Ramayans, getting into a more stable crew, but carefully burning no bridges as he did.

“You are certain his god is the loud one?” Tristan murmured, feigning a yawn.

“Yes,” Fortuna flatly replied. “And he is being incredibly tasteless about it.”

She did not deign to elaborate further and he knew better than to ask. There’s something off about you, Brun, Tristan decided. No one genuinely following sentiment ended up making all the right choices all the time. The other man was running a game, had to be.

But which, and for what purpose?

No answers would be found standing here, the thief knew, so he tore his gaze away. Whatever it was Brun wanted, if his ambitions extended beyond survival, then it would be something to chase after later. Tristan had more pressing matters to worry about, three of them to be exact. Francho was the most likely to have other offers, but Tristan still sought out Vanesa first. It was she whose expertise would determine whether his intentions were at all feasible.

The old woman was sitting by herself in a corner, looking half-asleep. The Watch physician had her on poppy extract for the pain, but Tristan had checked the vials and the man was keeping the doses as low as he could. It was for the best: at her age, too strong a dose risked sending her into the kind of sleep she would not be waking from. Not much had been done about the shattered leg, aside from cleaning it and binding it, but that was not laziness on the man’s part. The airavatan had broken the limb beyond repair, bone shredding muscles and tendons as it shattered into pieces. Her kneecap was in three pieces and the swelling made it nearly impossible to operate and stem the internal bleeding. The physician had little choice but to recommend amputation.

“Either way,” the watchman had told her, “you won’t ever be using that leg again.”

Vanesa had… balked, at that. Tristan had spent long enough as a cutter’s assistant to know that was not an uncommon reaction, but it had been startlingly ferocious. She went hysterical for a time, needing to be restrained until she calmed, and had been subdued since. The one-eyed clockmaker was awake enough to notice when he came to sat by her side, though her face betrayed her exhaustion.

“Is it time for lunch?” Vanesa asked.

“Not for a few hours yet,” Tristan said.

No one would be leaving anytime soon, anyhow. He thought some of the crews might set out to have a look at the shrines later this afternoon but doubted anyone would begin the maze until tomorrow. First they would want to recover and organize.

“Ah,” she muttered. “Sorry. My mind, it has been wandering.”

“Common enough when taking poppy extract,” he assured her.

She nodded, looking thankful. As if he had not simply said the truth.

“A nice young woman from the Watch is making me crutches,” Vanesa told him. “From an old oar, I believe?”

He said nothing.

“Anyhow,” Vanesa continued, “when they are finished I will be able to have a look at this maze. It seems an interesting enough place.”

Sometimes, Tristan thought, the line between kindness and cruelty was thin as a breath.

“You know you won’t be doing that,” he quietly said.

“Perhaps not in one of these companies forming,” Vanesa said, “but surely-”

“If you go into that maze, you will die.”

He interrupted as gently as he could, but his voice did not waver. It was a statement of fact, not a guess. Tristan had little heard of the tests these gods of the maze would set, but a one-eyed old woman with a broken leg would be as meat on the table. Vanesa’s lips pursed, then she looked away. He saw the emotions flicker across her worn face – frustration, anger, fear. And at the end of the road, resignation.

“I am dead if I stay here,” she finally said. “The physician says I have two weeks at most, with the bleeding inside the leg.”

Much as he wanted to bring up the amputation again, it was not his place. Vanesa knew the costs of her decision; they had been made plain to her. If she thought a slow death better than losing her leg then it was her choice to make.

“There may be,” Tristan said, “another way.”

Her eye went to him, as if dragged by a hook. The hope he saw there burned, for there were no certainties in what he had to offer.

“Have you had a close look at the gate?” he asked.

“I have not,” she admitted.

“Then let us,” Tristan said. “I think you will find it interesting.”

He went about it methodically. First he took one the spare benches near the kitchen and moved it in front of the gate, then went back for Vanesa. She had to lean on him all the while, most of her weight carried for her, but he got her to the bench and helped her down. She was barely paying attention by the time he did, sole eye flittering across the span of the iron gate – or, more precisely, the intricate mechanisms covering it.

“I cannot tell where it begins,” she murmured. “Oh – and some parts go into the gate. Pistons, Tristan, see those? That will be aetheric machinery, unless they have a steam engine on the other side that can run forever.”

“Can you make any sense of it?” he asked.

“The grids are the key,” Vanesa told him, eye still on the gate. “See how the gears around them are all derivative? Those metal plaques are the functional equivalent of levers, or perhaps more accurately a combination lock.”

“Moving them would have an effect,” Tristan said.

Vanesa nodded.

“Absolutely,” she said. “Mind you, there are few distinguishing marks on them and I do not see how anyone could easily get up there to activate them, but-”

She paused, enthusiasm slowly bleeding out of her as she turned to him.

“It is an interesting puzzle,” Vanesa said, “but it will not get either of us through the maze. I do not need a distraction, Tristan.”

Yes you do, the thief thought. Else she would simply wither on the vine. Better yet that this was not a distraction at all.

“I disagree,” Tristan murmured. “I think that gate is exactly how we get through the maze.”

He gestured at the gate.

“The stone around it isn’t the same as the fort’s,” he said. “And the scale of the structure it i set in is absurd.”

While the stone the gate was set in a pillar, as it reached all the way to the distant ceiling of the cavern, it perhaps ought to be called a tower instead for the sheer size of it. It was at least a hundred feet long from side to side, at the apex of the curve.

“So perhaps it is a First Empire ruin,” Vanesa shrugged. “That is no surprise given the great machinery above our heads.”

“You are not paying attention to the right part,” Tristan chided her. “The pillar is in perfect state. This Old Fort, however, is falling apart.”

The old woman stared at him, still uncomprehending.

“It was built later, not by the Antediluvians,” the thief said. “And to guard what, a gate it would take ten batteries of cannons to break through? I doubt it. And that leaves only…”

“The shrines,” Vanesa said. “The maze. You believe it is also a recent addition.”

“I do,” Tristan agreed. “And now that begs the question: what is that pillar for, then? Where does the gate lead?”

The clockmaker’s lone eye dipped upwards, at the pieces of gold slowly moving above them and giving out a ghostly golden glow.

“Even Antediluvians needed to maintain their machines,” Vanesa softly said. “However fine the make, they fell apart eventually.”

“And they would need a way to get up there,” Tristan murmured. “I believe we are looking at it.”

Vanesa hesitated.

“There is no guarantee that up there waits a path across the mountains,” she said.

Tristan could have said that even the Antediluvians must have brought the pieces in from somewhere, that if the maze of shrines was recent and a god bound to the gate on the other side then that very gate might be just as a recent an addition, but at the end of the day she was right: there was no guarantee.

“It is a bet,” Tristan admitted.

He met her eye squarely.

“But I believe in it enough to hold off on the maze,” he said.

Tristan was a rat: could there be a stronger endorsement from the likes of him than putting his own fortunes on the line? His life was the sole thing of worth he owned. He said nothing more, letting the silence do the talking. The Sacromontan knew she would agree, for as Lan had seen the truth was Vanesa did not truly want to die. She was resigned to it, perhaps, but if the choice was between the certain death of entering the maze as a lone cripple and rolling the dice on the gate they both knew what she would choose.

Tristan did not hurry her, letting her make the journey at her own pace until she was staring down at her ruin of a leg. There was a bitterness to the cast of her face that came to it more often these days.

“Well,” Vanesa said. “I suppose there is not much left for me to lose.”

She sighed.

“Only the two of us?” she asked.

“I want Francho as well,” the thief immediately replied. “And I have recruited outside helpers.”

“Of course you have,” the old woman tiredly smiled. “You may count me as part of your cabal, then. I look forward to seeing what comes of it.”

He would have stayed longer, sitting with her, but she dismissed him. Wanted to look at the gate without distractions, she said, but if he wanted to be a dear he could see about getting her ink and paper. That would have to wait, he decided, until he had spoken with Francho. The old professor was speaking with Lan when he found him, the blue-lipped dealer departing in a huff when she saw him. Francho cocked a brow at the thief but Tristan rolled his eyes.

“I will ask no questions, then,” the toothless old man drawled. “What may I do for you, young man?”

“Answer a few questions of mine, for one,” he said.

“Had I known all along that all it took was the threat of grisly death to seed curiosity in my students,” Francho smiled, “I might have dabbled in it at Reve.”

“It might have shortened your career,” the thief amusedly replied.

“Oh, murder is the least of the offences one can get away with after tenure,” Francho said. “The old Master of Music once – ah, but I am rambling again. Please, do ask away.”

Tristan was going to come back and get that story about the Master of Music later, for it promised to be most amusing, but it would have to wait.

“I expect Lan was approaching you on behalf of Tupoc Xical,” the thief leadingly said.

“The Izcalli is most forthright about wanting cannon fodder,” Francho said. “The honesty of the offer is somewhat admirable.”

“You don’t seem to be biting at the bait,” Tristan said.

“I thought it unwise before finding out what it is you are plotting,” the professor candidly said. “You do not seem to be joining up with anyone, which has me wondering what you do intend.”

“There is a mystery in the bones of this trial,” the thief said. “I would dig it out.”

Francho considered him, sucking at his gums thoughtfully.

“The gate,” he said. “You want to open the gate.”

“An endeavour in which a historian might be of some use,” Tristan said. “Especially one with fine ears.”

The reference to his contract was not particularly subtle, but neither was it too telling. And he did want Francho on his side, if not strictly speaking need him. If the gate were easy to open, the Watch already would have. Having someone could listen to what had gone on around the great pillar, to parse out the parts of the puzzle they unearthed, would be very useful indeed. It would starkly increase their odds of success, in Tristan’s opinion.

“An interesting offer,” Francho finally said.

It was not agreement, but neither was it a refusal. Unlike Vanesa, the old professor might potentially survive delving the maze – the risks were merely high, especially if he went in under the likes of Tupoc.

“Think on it,” Tristan simply said. “I will not be going anywhere.”

His odds, he thought, were good. He would know by the end of the day what kind of a crew it was he was working with.

—

Maryam only reappeared an hour later and avoided talking about where she had been. Of Beatris there was still no sign, which had him reconsidering how he would get eyes in Angharad Tredegar’s crew, but before that question was answered there was another conversation he wanted to have.

“Not while people are around,” Maryam whispered. “Especially the Watch.”

So they waited for night to meet, even as Tupoc’s crew and Ishaan’s went to have a look at the shrines. Tredegar, by contrast, seemed to be preparing her own for combat: putting them into formation, preparing weapons.

An hour before the Watch dimmed the lanterns Francho approached him.

“If it leads nowhere, I will have to turn to the maze,” the old professor warned.

“I would not ask you otherwise,” Tristan replied.

And like that, there were only two stones left to turn over.

—

Tristan considered night one of the more interesting lies people told themselves.

It rested at a lively intersection between need, tradition and control. Men must sleep, they could only stay awake for so long, therefore there must be an end to the day: a night where rest was allowed. Yet in most of Vesper there was no natural boundary to delimit this, only a few old wonders of the Antediluvians underwriting such a cycle in fact. It was thus in the hands of men to delimit night and day, to make them, and there the lie got interesting.

Was a stretch of hours to be called night because your parents had called it such? Tradition had weight, it was true. If you were raised to be awake at certain hours and asleep at others, you might not question it. But those hours were not the same for everyone, were they? Half the miners of the Trench lived during ‘night’, their little towns outside the walls of Sacromonte living askew in time from the rest of the City, and they were hardly the only ones. And it was not tradition that’d made that decision, for who would ever choose to work in the hell of the Trench?

It was those with power who had set the lines, the boundaries. It was they who decided when the lamplights dimmed and when they burned, when men worked and when they rested. Abuela had once told him that about forty years ago, the Six – the infanzones of infanzones – had tried to take an hour out of the night. They had wanted the docks and markets open longer, for those were the arteries of wealth in the City and sooner or later all of Sacromonte’s wealth made its way into the hands of the Six.

They’d not announced this or trumpeted it about, instead sneaking it in as a natural thing: the lights had stayed on, the shifts been extended. The public clocks were tampered with or taken down for repairs, leaving people to measure time by the eye, and the scheming few had thought that if this went on for long enough without notice they could steal an entire hour from the many. It’d not worked, Abuela had told him. People with little always noticed it when you took something from them.

Somewhere around three thousand people died in the Canario Riots, after the mob began storming noble mansions and the Guardia answered by wheeling out organ guns and firing them into the crowd.

Afterwards, smelling disaster, the Six hung a dozen ringleaders after accusing them of having taken coin from the Republics – it was all a foreign plot! – and after that show of strength promptly backed down. The debacle with the ‘stolen time’ was blamed on a single family, House Arlagon, which was exiled as the Six once more protected the rights of the good people of Sacromonte. The hour went back, the clocks were all mysteriously fixed within a week, all the world was pleased.

And the infanzones quietly began building worker’s towns outside the city walls, where criminals and the indebted would agree that day and night were whatever their betters said they were.

“What was the lesson of that story?” Tristan had asked Abuela.

“There is no such thing as night,” she’d said. “Yet look at the storm of violence that was unleashed when men tried to change the span of it. An old lie is a powerful thing, Tristan. Learn to use them.”

To the boy he’d been when they first had the conversation it had meant little. As he grew older, though, the words began to take meaning. It was not a secret or a trick Abuela had been trying to teach him but a perspective: the things taken for granted, the foundations that Vesper rested on, should not be spared a skeptical eye. The chains that bound men most surely were those they never saw, never thought to strain against. Tristan was no confederales, to plot the bloody liberation of Sacromonte with a butcher’s knife on his lap and a red circle sown over his heart, but he would not suffer being owned. So he’d learned to keep his eyes open, to sniff out the lies.

And this Trial of Ruins, it reeked.

Enough that it was forcing him to look back at the entire Dominion of Lost Things and wonder what it was that the Watch truly wanted with this place. He’d come here treading on a foundation of certainty: the blackcloaks used the trials to bring in skilled but irregular recruits while fattening their pockets by letting the nobles use them as proving grounds. Perhaps a little posturing thrown in as well, an unspoken reminder that at the end of the trials the infanzones used to set themselves above one another all that the victors qualified to be was the rank and file of the Watch.

Only the numbers didn’t add up.

Even if Tristan was willing to dismiss the way trial-takers were chosen – and he wasn’t, not when he had to wonder if the blackcloaks would actually want half of the people who’d paid to get on the Bluebell – there was a larger discrepancy behind it all: coin. How many infanzones, how many red games candidates were sent every year? Possibly enough to keep an old cog like the Bluebell and the other ship the first wave had taken afloat, their crews paid, but not much more than that. Then the Watch would have to pay and feed the garrison on the Dominion, to supply and maintain its forts, to defend them against the cultists of the Red Eye.

In the most generous of suppositions, if a hundred people took to the Dominion every year and half of these survived to become Watch – a very generous supposition – then after the losses to sickness, gods and cultists were subtracted, the blackcloaks couldn’t be getting more than a dozen net recruits or so. And for those dozen recruits they’d be drenching their ledger in red. He had thought this explained the seeds and trade goods he and Maryam had figured out at the docks: the Watch was trying to get some gold out of this place and perhaps lower its casualties with bribes.

But now here they got to the Trial of Ruins, a horror of dead and dying gods under a First Empire aether machine that had to be worth a small city. Why hadn’t they stripped that thing out and sold it to make a fortune? If they feared the gods of the maze enough to threaten the execution of anyone contracting with one without reporting it, why not fill this place to the brim with blackpowder and light a fuse? No, there was something going on here beyond the Watch running a seemingly sloppy recruitment operation.

And instead of running around in the maze with the rest of them, Tristan Abrascal was going to find out what it was the blackcloaks knew the rest of them didn’t.

The first step to that, in an unusual turn, was not to be all that difficult. There was one person who knew more about these trials than she should and they were already set to talk. Maryam had promised, in the heat of the moment when the airavatan seemed set to kill them, that they were to have a conversation. It was a one best kept away from prying eyes, she had claimed, so Tristan used an old lie in the very simplest of ways: they waited until night made everyone go to sleep. Not every trick had to be bold or brilliant.

They met in one of the broken bastions under a ceiling half-collapsed, surrounded by loose masonry. The blackcloaks didn’t patrol, not really: they kept watch from atop the walls and sometimes went around the fortress to eye the courtyard but they had no interest in the nooks and crannies of the Old Fort. They’re not afraid of animals or lemures, Tristan decided. Given Lieutenant Wen’s enthusiastic oration about gods eating each other, he suspected there might not be any around.

Maryam came in but a few heartbeats after him, hand on the knife at her side as her blue eyes scanned the dark. He pushed off of the stone he’d been leaning against, passing under the broken ceiling and the rays of gold pouring down it. Her shoulders relaxed.

“You know,” Maryam said, “if someone else had asked me into a dark corner after everyone went to sleep, I might have assumed they had intentions.”

He cocked an eyebrow.

“But not me?”

She rolled her eyes.

“I’m not blind, Tristan,” she said. “You are about as interested in bedsport as I am in collecting butterflies.”

“A traditional hobby, if largely pointless,” he said.

He had not specified which he was talking about, which by the look of her grin she had absolutely noticed. Much as he disliked sobering the mood after such a pleasant start, he had not come here for the pleasure of her company. Seeing the change in his expression, Maryam’s own shed the mirth.

“And now I pay my dues, yes?” she said.

“I would not dig into your personal secrets,” Tristan said, “but I have questions and you answers.”

She dismissed his words with a wave.

“I made my choice out on the plains and will not walk it back now,” Maryam said. “There are limits to what I may speak of, but within them I will not balk.”

“You said,” Tristan murmured, “that this year was not like the others. That some of us were marked for more than simply joining the Watch.”

Maryam slowly nodded, she was considering her words – navigating promises, perhaps? – and ultimately it was with a question she answered.

“What strikes you as strange about the Bluebell passengers?”

He cocked his head to the side. He’d given that subject much thought, now that he had time to spare and more information to chew on.

“You and Leander Galatas could both use Signs,” he said. “And not the way some street witch would, the usual potions and curses. The real kind of Signs, those Navigators use. That is more than passing rare.”

She nodded encouragingly.

“There are also much too many people with contracts,” he added after a moment. “It seems like at least half the foreigners have one.”

Zenzele Duma did, and Ishaan Nair. The same was likely true of Tupoc Xical and Tristan sincerely doubted that even a mirror-dancer could be as quick as Angharad Tredegar without a little help. Throw in Song, Acanthe Phos, Isabel Ruesta, Brun and Francho – then on top of that the rumor that Remund Cerdan had one as well? The numbers were troubling. Even if no one else was hiding a contract, which he had doubts about, then out of the thirty-three people on the Bluebell there had been at least twelve with contracts, counting himself and Marzela. It was a staggering number even for individuals aiming to enter the Watch.

Someone might well go their entire life without meeting that many contractors, much less all of them in the same room.

“All the recommended are being evaluated to see if they qualify for special enrolment,” Maryam told him. “Yourself included.”

“Special enrolment?” he pressed.

“I cannot speak about it,” she admitted. “I skirt the edge of breaking an agreement by even telling you this much.”

As he’d thought, her foreknowledge had come with strings. It only reinforced that he was speaking to the right person to find the thread he must pull at, because the most likely suspect for Maryam’s interlocutor was the Watch or a least a member of it.

“You knew about this before coming here,” he decided, studying her face. “What is that makes this particular year different from the others?”

“Timing,” she quietly said. “An opportunity that will not come twice.”

Tristan passed a hand through his hair, frustrated at how vague she was being but half-sure it was not on purpose. She has called it an ‘agreement’, what stilled her tongue, and that implied someone on the other end of the bargain – it was not an oath, but a bargain struck with another. Someone who might care if she broke the terms.

“The Krypteia,” he said. “The Masks, you said they wanted something from me. Do you know what it is?”

There were a hundred name for the agents of the Krypteia, the most secretive of the Watch, and as many rumours for what their purpose might be. Spies and assassins, most said, though others claimed it was the watchmen themselves they watched over. Whatever the truth, their reputation for ruthlessness and secrecy was no lie. It might not be a good thing at all that he had somehow drawn their eye. Maryam studied him for a long moment, blue eyes searching, before she let out a startled breath.

“So you really don’t know,” she quietly said. “It’s not something they want, Tristan, it’s you. They are the Circle that recommended you.”

Did that mean everyone who’d been recommended had – no, that wasn’t as important as the fact that for some reason he had apparently caught the eye of the fucking Masks.

“You’re sure?” he got out.

Maryam leaned forward, openly worried.

“Tristan, the other recommended all had a name with them,” she said. “The person who gave the recommendation. All except you: yours was just a wax seal with the symbol of the Krypteia. I don’t know high up their ranks you must be to be able to use that, but it’s not low.”

She grimaced.

“You’re telling me you have no idea who did this?”

“I know who arranged for me to have a place on the Bluebell,” he admitted. “But I could never be sure she was part of the Watch. She has never claimed so and I have never seen her in a black cloak.”

But how likely was Abuela to put one of those on, if she was truly part of the Krypteia? The rest of the Watch announced themselves, the black cloaks like a banner reminding everyone of what they stood for, but the Masks were spies. The last thing they would want was to be announced.

“It could be she knows someone in the Krypteia,” Maryam said, be she sounded doubtful. “Maybe she called in an old favour.”

Old was the right word, for Abuela was at least nearing seventy for all that she remained spry. She could be retired, he thought. Could Masks retire? He did not know. Tristan could feel his mind beginning to go in circles, picking away at all the many unknowns he had no way to shed light on, so he forced himself to keep speaking.

“Tell me about Song Ren.”

It was half a guess, come of details he had noticed in that bracing debate about who should get lynched for Jun’s murder, but the rueful surprise on her face told him he’d struck true.

“I met her before the trials,” Maryam said. “She is here for the same reason I am.”

“And what is that?” he asked, knowing the answer he would get.

“Not something I can speak about without breaking my agreement,” she replied.

The special enrolment, he thought. That was the heart of the secret, for both she and Song. But in a way that was a disappointment for that was a particular, a temporary addition to the greater secret of the Dominion of Lost Things. It would not help him unearth the truth of this place.

“How much do you really know about these trials?” he quietly asked.

“More than I should,” Maryam said, then grimaced. “Less than you likely think. I can tell you that most people who contract with a maze god will get executed – I was specifically warned against it – and that the sanctuary past the ruins is a fort on the other side of the mountains.”

He raised an eyebrow, inviting her to continue.

“My source was vague on the Trial of Grass,” she admitted. “But it is meant to rid the Watch of the reckless and trouble cases.”

Tristan bit at his thumb, thoughtful. First the relative shallowness of what she had said, juxtaposed with the emphasis made on certain details. If he had to bet, someone with full information had given her a broad outline and emphasized dangers that might get her killed. Has to be the Watch, he thought. Infanzones wouldn’t know anything about the third trial, or care about keeping whatever its purpose was intact – the easy guess for why the information she’d been given was vague. Good enough to help craft strategy, but not much beyond that.

Second, he was now even more certain that the Trial of Ruins was the heart of this entire enterprise. Weeding out the reckless and the trouble cases? That sounded like filtering tacked on at the end of the road so that the blackcloaks would not be stuck with anyone they didn’t truly want to enter their ranks. Which means the parts that matter are here and within the Trial of Lines, he thought.

“You’re not interested in the maze at all, are you?” Maryam suddenly said. “I thought you might just be leveraging your reputation, holding out for a better offer by one of the groups, but it’s not them your eye is on.”

“I will have to go into the maze eventually,” Tristan acknowledged.

If nothing else, it would be the most expedient way to get rid of Cozme Aflor and the Cerdans. He was not worried about being able to join later, given that after casualties began to mount all the diving crews would be looking for fresh blood. It would not make him liked, but what did he care for that? Still, it was through the gate he intended to pass this maze – and not the one the Watch had told him to use.

“Yet keeping my attention on it strikes me as missing the canal for the barge,” he continued. “This place exists for a reason and this game is not it.”

“That will be Watch business,” she warned him.

“Mine as well, so long as the Watch demands I take part in this trial,” Tristan replied.

Maryam paced away, crossing her arms when she came to a halt. Light poured down from behind, gilding her silhouette as shadows obscured the lay of her face.

“You are not going to let this go.”

Neither of them pretended that had been a question. Through the shadows he met her eyes with his own, neither blinking.

“Are you?” he challenged. “What did the warnings help, when the airavatan hunted us? You’re in the same game as the rest of us, Maryam. Their secrets are just as likely to get you killed.”

For a long moment they remained that way, until finally she jerked her head to the side.

“There’s another aether machine around,” Maryam told him. “It can be used to look at parts of the island on great panels of gold – it’s how they make their reports, though supposedly there are limitations. We will have to be careful.”

We, she had said, and like that a weight left his shoulders. Maryam stepped away from the light, the gold sliding off her dress. It left the ghostly pit between them, painting the rubble. He saw the hesitation on her face but said nothing, letting her come to the decision to speak in her own time.

“Your surname,” Maryam said. “You keep it hidden for a reason.”

It was, he thought, gently done of her. If he simply answered yes the conversation would end there, but the door was opened if he wanted to say more. And it was tempting to simply put an end to it, but the thief held back on the impulse. She had, the day before their group tried the bridge, implied she might help him with his revenge. Tristan had just decided to dig at the Watch’s secrets because they might get him killed, which would make the hypocrisy of keeping Maryam in the dark here a large one to swallow. Not so much he could not, but he found he did not want to.

Not after all she had told him, even if those secrets were not her own.

“I cannot be certain,” Tristan said, “but I believe Cozme Aflor might recognize the name Abrascal.”

“It is uncommon?” Maryam asked.

“Only somewhat,” he said. “But while we only met a handful of times when I was a child, he knew my father for two years.”

The blue-eyed woman slowly nodded. She did not ask, which perversely enough made him want to say more.

“He is at the bottom of my list for a reason,” Tristan murmured. “He pulled the trigger, in the end, but they’d killed my father long before that.”

“House Cerdan,” she said.

He nodded.

“Sacromonte is,” he began, then halted.

It was hard to explain to someone not of the City.

“We do not have a king,” he said. “And the Six, they are not different from other houses in principle. Most of their privileges are ceremonial. Yet it is the Six who rule us, have for as long as anyone can remember, and every noble house in Sacromonte craves to sit where they sit.”

He passed a hand through his hair.

“Only a few come close,” Tristan said, “and the Cerdan are one of them. Only they can’t seem to break in. Their blood is the right amount of old, they own enough land and make enough coin, but they don’t have the something that lets the Six be on top – like contracts for the Arquer, or the feracity chambers for the Calzada.”

He thinly smiled.

“So they’ve been trying to bridge the gap,” he said. “Quietly, so the others don’t notice, but quiet is just about the only line they drew in the sand.”

“What did they do, Tristan?” she quietly asked.

He looked away, jaw clenching. Remembering how Father had seemed so grateful when Cozme pulled the trigger.

“Too much for me to forgive,” he said.

They left it at that.

—

Maryam snuck back ahead, at his suggestion, because Tristan was not yet done with the night. It was not back to his bedroll he went but instead into the shadows of the Old Fort. And there, patiently waiting as he watched the movements of the patrols, he found out two things of some import.

The first was Beatris, coming out of the Watch barracks and taking a short walk around the courtyard with an escort before returning within. Though she had a watchman with her, she did not seem a prisoner. Protection, Tristan thought. Unless he was quite wrong, Beatris had withdrawn from the trials and no one else yet knew of it.

The second came later, after he risked getting closer to the bastion with the astronomy equipment. It did not seem to be getting used, to his confusion, until his eye was drawn by a flash of lantern light. The bastion went slightly around the side of the great pillar, but it was high above that he saw the light: an opening in the stone, from which someone was lowered a rope ladder.

He’d just found the other lieutenant in command of the garrison, Tristan decided, and why Lieutenant Wen had been so convinced none of them would see her.

And with her he had found his first clue.

# Chapter 23

One more joined their number.

Yaretzi was the last, approaching her on the evening when Tupoc and Lord Ishaan’s crews went scouting ahead. The Aztlan did not look any worse for the labors of the first trial, her tanned face without mark and her practical clothes – a sleeveless stripe blouse above a long patchwork skirt, all of it under a thick sailor’s coat – barely scuffed. The earrings dangling from her ears were of the same copper-gold as Tupoc’s, but they were set with blue stones. They drew attention to her sultry dark eyes.

“Turquoise?” Angharad asked, touching her ear as the other woman sat.

Yaretzi looked surprised, even pleased.

“Indeed,” she said. “I was part of the Turquoise Society before leaving Izcalli.”

Angharad cocked an eyebrow.

“I thought Izcalli societies were named after animals,” she said. “Jaguars, eagles and the like.”

“Warrior societies are,” Yaretzi corrected. “Izcalli cosmology separates the world into three spheres, one of which is war. As a diplomat I was part of the second sphere, culture, whose societies are named after precious stones.”

“And the third?” she curiously asked.

“Trade,” Yaretzi said. “In the sense of occupation, not the mercantile, though that is also covered. It is the third sphere and the least, though still above okse – the other, that which is not in the spheres.”

“I will hazard a guess that this is where foreigners are counted,” Angharad said.

“It is hardly our fault that they did not have the good sense to be born Izcalli,” she said, lips twitching.

“I can only apologize for the slight,” the noblewoman gravely replied.

“I will forgive you this once,” Yaretzi allowed. “It is a difference in philosophy, the way the societies are named. A warrior seeks to embody the strengths of their emblem, but that is a personal distinction. A cultural society is named after precious stone because we seek for our service to Izcalli to be just as precious.”

“That is admirable,” Angharad said. “One’s honor is often found in service to that of others.”

It was the fundamental tenet of honor in the Isles, whose root was the High Queen. She was keeper of the honor of all Malan, its beginning and end, and could not die so long as the people of the Isles remained honorable.

“Mostly it teaches us to think differently than warrior society thugs,” Yaretzi said. “There are only so many flower wars you can start before you’re drowning in enemies instead of war prizes. I think our… friend Master Xical never quite learned that lesson.”

Angharad eyed her speculatively.

“But you did?”

“I have spent much of my life learning to read people,” the Aztlan smiled. “Which is why I can tell you with a degree of certainty that Shalini is one of the loveliest people you will ever meet, and also that if she suspects someone might be slight trouble for her Ishaan she will fire a shot into the back of their head without batting an eye.”

Yaretzi’s smile never wavered, though it pulled tight around the yes.

“A strong crew, those two have assembled, but until they have decided whether they are siblings or lovers I would much rather be part of yours,” she said. “It will do wonders for my nerves, if nothing else.”

Angharad choked, both at the glimpse into the private affairs of the Someshwari and the suddenness of the request.

“You can fight?” she coughed out.

Yaretzi stared flatly at her.

“My dear,” she said, “I was an Izcalli diplomat.”

That was fair enough, and so their company added another. They spent the rest of the afternoon preparing supplies and drilling basic formations at Angharad’s insistence, for a crew that did not know their place would only trip each over each other in a storm. Or so Mother had always said. Come evening she was satisfied everyone had elementary understanding of each other’s skill and would know where to stand when violence inevitably came knocking.

Now all that was left was to venture out.

—

Come morning the divisions had become clearly visible.

Three delving crews sat together for breakfast, and then the handful of spares who did not intend to venture out that day – Tristan, Sarai, Francho and Vanesa. Some off-color jests were made by Remund about why Tristan and Sarai might want to stay behind with only dotards as witnesses, but they petered out in the face of her obvious disapproval. Save for that misstep, the mood was pleasant. Yaretzi got along well with the pair she had shared the Trial of Lines with, though she tread carefully around Zenzele, and while the air between Song and Isabel was yet frosty the Tianxi found much to speak about with Inyoni.

That friendly air was shattered by Sergeant Mandisa, who made a round at every table with a wooden crate full of what Angharad finally saw to be small iron lanterns. None larger than a fist, charming but quite identical. Some Tianxi workshop must make them in bulk. The sergeant showed them the small engraved circle inside where they must put at least a drop of their blood, about where a candle would be were this a real lantern. Angharad pricked her forearm with a knife and smudged a drop inside as instructed.

“Why a lantern?” she asked Sergeant Mandisa.

“Same reason the Twenty Crowns used them,” Lady Inyoni idly cut in.

Angharad stared at her blankly, to the other woman’s confusion.

“Have you never read ‘The Empty Sea’?” she slowly asked.

Ah, the noblewoman thought. That would explain it. It was the third of the Great Works and from what she recalled only marginally more interesting that ‘The Vainglory’ and its incomprehensible mythologies or the endless litany of deaths and disasters that was ‘The Dead Shore’. Angharad had stopped trying to read it after Father admitted that though it purported to recount how the nations of her ancestors had sailed away from the dying Old World and journeyed to Vesper it was a largely philosophical book about the nature of mankind and its reflections on the eponymous Empty Sea.

Lots of finding islands where the lesson was that men were the real monsters all along, she’d heard.

“I began the Works with ‘The Ships of Morn’,” she admitted.

And ended them with the following work, The Madness of King Issay, she refrained from adding. That she had only read two of the nine Great Works was occasionally a slight embarrassment.

“Can’t blame her, I never read as anything half as depressing as The Dead Shore,” Sergeant Mandisa shared. “I’ve written up casualty lists that were more cheerful.”

“But you did read it, that’s the point,” Inyoni grumbled. “It is our common heritage, there’s a reason it’s mandatory.”

The grizzled older woman squinted at her.

“The Twenty Crowns, Lady Tredegar, our very own ancestors,” she said with an accusatory pointed finger, “found that our perceptions influence the aether. We associate lanterns with sight, with finding things, and so-”

“Gods will be able to use them to get at you,” Sergeant Mandisa completed. “You know, for the eating.”

Both of her gave her odd looks at the choice of word.

“I was raised Orthodox, they’re not spirits to me,” the sergeant informed them.

“It is your prerogative to be wrong,” Inyoni conceded.

“Hey now.”

“It is not her fault, she was never taught any better,” Angharad ‘excused’.

“And I was going to give you hints about the maze,” Mandisa said.

Inyoni raised an eyebrow.

“Were you really?”

A moment passed.

“No,” Mandisa confessed. “Gods, it’s like getting stared down by my own grandfather. Any moment now you’ll be asking why I haven’t found a husband yet.”

“And why is that, young lady?” Inyoni asked.

Sergeant Mandisa shivered, called the whole affair eerie and fled to another table. Angharad lost the war to keep her grin from showing, though she would admit she had not put up much of a fight. As breakfast slowly came to an end and it became clear that once more Beatris would not be joining them, Angharad’s lips thinned. Isabel had last evening admitted that she had not seen her maid in over a day, not even for meals, and that the Watch had refused to answer her questions. Since she no longer slept in the old stables like the rest of them and her personal affairs appeared to have been removed, it was suspected that she slept in the barracks with the blackcloaks.

Angharad sought and found Isabel’s eye. As they were all at the same table, a common company, it was not breaking the oath she had given Remund and must still heed.

“She may have retired from the trials,” Angharad said.

“And not even asked me for leave?” Isabel said, openly dubious. “The barracks are also where that charming old woman was operated, so there must be a physician’s office within. I expect she is simply sicker than anticipated.”

How much of that was genuine belief and how much was saving face at possibly having been abandoned by her handmaid Angharad could not tell, and now was not the time to plumb the depths of the question.

“Regardless, she is not to be counted among our company,” she said.

To that Isabel could only agree. They would be eight, then, and not nine.

After everyone finished breaking the last of their fast, when her crew went to get their packs, Angharad found herself approached by a pair she had so far had little to do with: Lord Ishaan Nair and Shalini Goel. Save their occasional cordial conversations on the Bluebell they had hardly spent a minute together, so this was unlikely to be a social call. Movement drew her eye and she found Song, ready and armed, already on her way. Isabel was behind her, talking to Remund with a faint air of irritation on her face. Pleased with the prompt reinforcements Angharad turned to meet the Someshwari pair with a polite smile just as Song came to stand at her side, mirroring Shalini.

“Lady Angharad,” Ishaan greeted her.

“Lord Ishaan,” she replied. “Good morning to you.”

“And you,” he easily said.

He looked better now, not at all wan or feverous as he had the days before. The unpleasantness brought on by his contract must have passed.

“Shalini.”

“Song.”

Their tones were strangely amused, given the banality of the situation. Were this another situation Angharad would have engaged the others in small talk, as her station demanded, but they had more pressing duties to attend to.

“May I be of assistance to you, Lord Ishaan?” she asked.

“It occurred to me that while we will part ways later,” the chubby-cheeked man said, “we could journey to the shrines together.”

The tone was casual, the implied offer was not. Angharad decided to set it out plainly.

“Mutual defense against Tupoc’s group on the way seems agreeable,” she said. “And it would be diplomatic to keep some distance in order to… avoid arguments.”

Zenzele Duma was a lord of Malan, he would no more break a truce than he would shoot a child out of the black, but temper were best left untested if possible.

“Brisk business,” Shalini commented.

“We left our tea and silks at home,” Song replied.

They both ignored their seconds.

“Against Tupoc’s group or other third parties that are not the Watch,” Lord Ishaan counteroffered. “And I would extend the same terms to a common return, should we leave the maze around the same time.”

Angharad could see the attraction in a common return, as they would be the most weak then – tired, wounded, possibly carrying corpses. The first part she hesitated about, for it was unpleasantly open-ended. Third parties could mean a great many things, even if their cooperation was limited to mutual defence.

“Third parties that were not intentionally provoked,” Angharad finally specified.

She would not let her crew be dragged into disputes like a reeve tricked into siding with some Uthukile clan. She had heard the stories, the reeve always ended up shot and then the clans promptly made a peace-marriage so they could begin raiding their other neighbors for cattle instead.

Being appointed a royal reeve on the Low Isle was not what a wise woman called a reward.

“Cautious,” Shalini said.

“Last time my people weren’t, it took four Cathayan Wars to get you out.”

“Savage,” she praised.

Angharad traded a look with Ishaan, sharing in the kinship of being faintly embarrassed of the person they had brought along. They shook on it, as much to avoid more of that than because there was nothing left to quibble over. As they parted ways the Pereduri tried to look for what Yaretzi had mentioned, but mostly she saw that Shalini was protective of the man – which was hardly a revelation.

She informed the others of the bargain struck as they assembled to move out, to mostly approval. Zenzele’s face darkened but even he saw the sense in a protection pact. They set out without further dallying, through openings in the ramparts at the back of the Old Fort. The Watch kept an eye on them from above as they moved across the rubble and onto the uneven bare rock of the cavern floor. It was not so smooth here as it had been before they entered the fort.  

Without lanterns and the pale golden glow from above it would have been trouble to walk: not only were there crevices and clumps but also stretches of some sort of coppery moss that was highly slippery. Lord Ishaan’s crew was waiting ahead, nearly arrayed, while ahead of them both lanterns made it plain that Tupoc Xical and his five had taken the lead.

The journey was uneventful, though the atmosphere was stilted from nerves and tension. It was about a quarter hour from the fort that the slope of broken shrines began, Lord Ishaan informed her. After they left behind the great pillar the Old Fort was nestled against, it was largely open grounds between them and the ruins. Only a few jutting rocks, usually covered in that copper moss, broke up the barren landscape.

The beginnings of the maze were not clear, for though every piece of this place had been built by men the place itself had not – whatever haphazard spirit had seen fit to cast everything down in a pile cared not for gates and paths. Rubble and loose stones, sometimes entire slices of structures like arches and pillars, rose in a soft slope that inch by inch turned into a mountain within the mountain. So many temples and shrines and pavilions had been thrown atop one another that she could not tell where the ruins of one ended or began, leaving her with the impression that she truly was looking at a mountain.

There were dozens of half-open shrines that might have served as a gate, Angharad saw, but only three whose entrance was open beyond the first few feet. The three shrines the Watch had told them of: one marked by a lion, another a dove and the last a serpent. Tupoc’s crew was already slipping in a narrow crevice between two walls along which a broken mural of a serpent slithered. It felt a little on the nose for the Aztlan to choose the Serpent Shrine, in all honesty. Her musings were interrupted by Lord Ishaan, who offered her his hand to shake. She did.

“We explored the Lion Shrine yesterday,” the dark-eyed man said. “We will again today.”

“Good luck,” Angharad replied.

“And you.”

Theirs was, then, to be the Dove Shrine. It was in the middle of the three between a painted and sculpted arch to the left, adorned by roaring lionhead, and the narrow winding path that Tupoc was leading his fellows through. The way into their own shrine was broad stairs half-covered in dust and rubble, going up twenty feet into a collapsed arch – which would easily be climbed over, leading into yawning open gates whose sides were covered with intricate bronzes of doves at play. A hall continued into what she thought might be the shrine proper, while above the gate the mountain of ruins continued to rise.

A mere half a foot above a column had toppled backwards, stuck between two laughing monkey statues, and above those heads was a window where a yellow light trembled that – Angharad shook her head. She could spend a lifetime finding new paths here and barely scratch the surface. She would have to trust in the explorations of the Watch. She turned to glance back at her company, finding it grim-faced and ready.

“Forward,” she simply said. “Let us see what the shrine has in store for us.”

The stone here was unsettlingly dry, she noticed, not at all like the natural cavern floor they had walked on. It was as if the spirits of this place had licked up even the dew. Though Angharad went forward with a lantern, after passing the broken arch and entering the hallway she found it was hardly needed: lights burned on the walls at regular intervals, small trembling flames inside eggs of glass. It was surprisingly beautiful, especially when the light shone along the edge of the bronze reliefs adorning the walls: they showed feathers, the Pereduri thought, though some of them bent folded strangely.

They went down the corridor into a larger chamber, whose dusty floor was touched with old footsteps. The Watch, she decided. A flicker of movement at the corner of her eye had Angharad reaching for her new blade, a solid saber that was not at fault for not being the sword she wanted, but when she looked it was only an empty glass egg in a corner. The bare stone of this place was unsettling, so she pressed on without waiting longer.

This was, the Pereduri knew within a heartbeat of entering, the heart of the Dove Shrine. The chamber was the largest yet, at least thirty feet wide and as long, with elaborate decorations. The first few feet of the floor were bare stone, but beyond that a tiled floor in blue and bronze led all the way to another bare stretch and a cramped door at the back – but it was the walls that drew the eye. They were covered in dizzying murals of bronze tiles, painted so that great swirls of dark colors would envelop eyes and feathers, and exquisite perches of bronze extended at irregular intervals.

Angharad moved aside from the entrance but was careful to stay on the bare stone. The spirit of this shrine would reveal themselves soon enough: the only way out of this room seemed to lead into a much smaller chamber, perhaps the way out. Her instincts told true. The moment the last of them, Zenzele, entered there was a small flutter. Eight pairs of eyes turned to the same perch, where the spirit had deigned to reveal itself.

It looked like a dove, but now finally Angharad understood the strange gilding from earlier: every single feather was made of intricately folded paper, patterns within patterns, and she was careful not to look at them too long. If the powerful storm painted on the mural was any hint, there may be danger in staring. The dove spirit flicked its paper-fathers, eerily bird-like.

“Supplicants,” it spoke in a voice like fluttering paper, “you enter the shrine of-”

Angharad winced. That had not been a word, at least not in a way a woman’s ears could hear. Her companions seemed to have fared no better.

“By ancient accord,” the dove spirit continued, “for a wager you may take my trial and win right of passage.”

“And what is to be your trial, spirit?” Lady Inyoni called out.

The dove rustled with anger, paper feathers inflating. Spirits often enjoyed the unearned deference that was being called a god, but Inyoni had done no wrong. The sole god was the Sleeping God, they who would one day wake.

“Cross the tiles of my shrine,” it said, “without standing on water.”

Angharad eyed the tiles, seeing no water. Did it mean the blue tiles instead of the bronze? That would be easy enough since they alternated, which meant there was likely some sort of trap. Given how singularly well suited her contract was to avoid making such a mistake, however – it was nothing glimpses ahead would not see her through – then she ought to begin. It would be a good example, besides. Only before Angharad could so much as say a word she was interrupted.

“Let me,” Isabel said, stepping forward.

Surprise, Angharad’s among them.

“There is no need to-” she began, but the dark-haired beauty shook her head.

“There is,” she replied. “I am not unaware that my skill at arms is lacking compared to most here. I must then be ready to risk my life on tests of cleverness to compensate. It is only fitting.”

There were many approving faces at that, enough that Angharad curbed her instinct to insist that someone else should take the very first trial. It would be disrespect twice over: first of Isabel herself, who was acting with honor, and then of everyone else in this crew for implying that their lives were not of equal worth. She kept her worry off her face.

“Be careful,” she said instead.

“Of course, darling,” Isabel smiled back.

She then stepped forward, gathering her skirts, and approached the edge of the tiles straight-backed.

“God of the land, I ask you for terms,” she called out.

The dove spirit shuffled on its perch, what looked like feathers shivering at first glance in truth an intricate dance of paper folding and unfolding.

“I already gave them,” the spirit replied, its voice like pages being strummed.

“Then there will be no imposition in speaking them anew,” Isabel firmly insisted.

The spirit flicked its paper-feathers irritably, likely irked at having been robbed of starting another game entirely without telling anyone.

“There are sixty-four tiles on this floor,” the dove spirit said. “You must cross from one side to another without ever standing on water or leaving the tiles.”

“God of the land, I would accept these terms,” Isabel said. “I offer for my wager this lantern.”

She presented the small iron lantern touched with a drop of her blood.

“What offer you in return?”

“Peaceful passage unhindered through my shrine for all who stand in this room,” the dove spirit said. “Until your death.”

“God of the land,” Isabel replied, bowing respectfully, “I accept these terms and wagers.”

“Then you may undertake my test,” the spirit allowed. “Begin.”

Only Isabel did not immediately step onto one of the tiles. Instead she went looking through the bag she had carried, taking out a long and thin rod of metal – almost like a hollow fishing rod. The dark-haired beauty paced along the length of the tiles as everyone made room for her, eyes considering, before she pressed the tip of the metal rod on a blue tile – the fourth from the left on the first row. After nothing happened, she stepped onto the tile. Angharad’s heart stammered, but after a long moment it became plain Isabel was safe.

Methodically, Isabel began prodding other tiles.

Angharad was not sure of the rhyme or reason to it, for she tried not only tiles ahead of her but also the one to her left – only for that one to immediately crumple. Like a flower closing, the thin covering of paper of the tile bunched up and revealed the painted river underneath. Several of them breathed in sharply. There was the mentioned water.

“No supplicant you,” the dove spirit hissed, its voice like paper ripping. “Thief, thief, thiefthiefthief-”

Halfway across the board, one of the tiles shivered. In the heartbeat that followed it was no longer a tile but a gaping hole of shimmering darkness. Gloam, Angharad realized. A pit of Gloam. Nothing but death could come of stepping into that.

“It never promised to leave all the tiles,” Lord Zenzele noted. “We should have thought of that.”

“It is angry,” Song evenly replied. “And might never have acted such had Lady Isabel not been so obviously forewarned of this test.”

It was, Angharad admitted, likely she had been. The blind groping around seemed instead to have been Isabel looking for a particular pattern – perhaps there were several and she was trying to find out which she was dealing with? Certainly, after moving twice in a diagonal to the right and revealing two more paper tiles she moved with much more certainty. Only the dove spirit was angry, hissing its spiteful accusation of thief as it sowed another Gloam pit every minute or so. It was trying to box her in a corner, cut her path across, but though Isabel’s slightly shaking hands revealed fear her eyes were steady. It took bravery to take such a test, Angharad thought, even forewarned. Unlike her, the infanzona had never been trained for peril.

It was rather attractive to see that Isabel Ruesta was the kind of woman capable of gambling with her life, if it came to it.

For all the dove spirit’s anger, its tricks and test were no match for the stratagem plied against them. Within ten minutes Isabel set foot on the bare stone, victorious in the challenge posed to her. All eyes turned to the spirit, whose spitting anger was no great augury.

“Thief you are,” it screeched, paper twisted and bent. “Thief and victor. Get out of my sight.”

They hurried across careful to avoid the lingering pits of Gloam, which the spirit pointedly did not remove. Isabel’s nerves were soothed by the time Angharad joined her but her cheeks were still fetchingly reddened. There were some congratulations from the others as they left the large chamber for the smaller one behind it – little more than a dark room with a large bronze dove within it, which all took care not to touch. It felt like the idol of the shrine. Beyond that a hole in the wall led into a slice of golden light, a small barren garden where the glow from above cast shadows on the dusty ground.

They all breathed easier out there, away from the spirit and its anger at being beaten.

The garden was quite petty, for all that it was desolate and the earth covered in a layer of dust, but as they took the time to look around Angharad found why it was the Watch called this place a maze: there were easily three paths they could take, perhaps four. On the other side of the garden, beyond an elegant arrangement of stones a short, curved bridge over a deep crevasse led into what must be another shrine. To their left a slender path circled around what looked to be a forest of columns jutting out from a raised temple ground, while to their right a large slice of toppled stairs served as the first of a series of platforms to climb past the garden wall to what looked like a winding path.

“The columns look like the path that most advances,” Remund Cerdan pointed out.

He had been quiet today, almost withdrawn. It was unlike him, but then he was surrounded by strangers that were not beholden to him. Master Cozme had not left his side even once.

“It also looks like a larger temple,” Inyoni told him. “Could mean a stronger spirit.”

“If we take a test every hundred feet none of us will live to reach the gate on the other side of this cavern,” Song noted, “so I would argue against the shrine beyond the bridge.”

“Agreed,” Zenzele grunted. “Unless Lady Ruesta’s… luck would extend there as well?”

Isabel shook her head.

“I have never heard of this garden,” she said. “The end of the Dove Shrine was described to me as large courtyard with collapsed sections revealing tunnels.”

“It would not be much of a maze if it could so easily be mapped,” Master Cozme said. “Lady Tredegar, your opinion?”

“The broken stairs intrigue,” she admitted. “It seems to be that from up there we may well see the temple grounds anyhow, so come worst we could advance there better informed.”

“It is the most difficult path,” Remund Cerdan objected. “If any of us should miss a jump…”

“Sweat is good for the soul, Lord Remund,” Inyoni snorted. “I agree with Lady Tredegar.”

Most, if not all, did. They set out for the path to the right. Climbing atop the toppled slice of stairs was not difficult, neither was the leap atop what looked like the roof of a ruined stone gazebo. From that roof to the top of remarkably fat column was trickier, given the smaller size of where they might leap, but after Angharad stayed behind to help Yaretzi make the jump the others followed suit and their company was lucky enough no one fell. The Pereduri was not certain the height would be enough to break a leg, unless one fell at a very bad angle, but it certainly would have hurt.

The edge of the garden wall was the last jump, going into a slightly lower stripe of tiled roof that swiftly got covered by the edge of a collapsed rotunda. It was easy enough, if you were careful not to slip on the tiles, and after that the path needed no jumping at all: they circled around the edge of the rotunda, seeing the temple under it and worrisome flickering lights, before climbing up an angled walkway past a series of arches. It seemed that had cut above many trials, which was good news if they could find a way down. Unfortunately the paths kept going up. They doubled back after stairs heading down led to a barred iron gate, then shimmied along the side of ziggurat while strange shapes prowled in the too-pale grass below. Yet for all that they kept rising, they also kept advancing – and without tests!

Their luck came at an end when the fallen-but-whole aqueduct they were using as a road crossed a gap to bring them straight at an open gate, flanked by two waterfalls with no other path in sight. They gathered near the gate – it was pitch black inside – and shuffled awkwardly. It must have been at least an hour and change since they took the first test, it felt as if they had begun anew.

“Nowhere to go but forward, it seems,” Song muttered.

“I wouldn’t say that,” Lady Inyoni replied.

She was, Angharad saw when she turned, kneeling by the waterfall to the left.

“The current is weak and the water shallow,” the older woman told them. “We could get around the test through the waterway, if we are not afraid to get wet.”

There was some debate, but at the end of the day they preferred shuffling leg-high in the wet with their bags held above their heads than trying their luck with another spirit. It was as exhausting to wade in the water, even against so light a current, but the dimly lit waterway eventually led to a luminous series of pools nestled between shrine walls so high they might as well have been cliffs. The water was deeper in the pools so they kept to the sides, and it looked like a dead end until Song found handholds carved in the side of a cliff. They led about twenty feet up, to a cleverly hidden nook that was the entrance to a tunnel.

There was not much space up there, so after Angharad and Zenzele joined Song there they had to shout down to talk with the others. Song was convinced the tunnel was not a god’s lair, insisting there was no shrine mark, and she was convincing enough the others agreed. It helped that no one wanted to go back through the waterway if they could help it.

The tunnel turned sharply to the left through what felt like solid stone, eventually reaching open air and revealing a large domed temple in the distance, atop series of airy stairs. To get there, however, they must make their way along a thin ledge that faced an elegant red mosaic on one side and a precipitous drop on the other. Looking down, Angharad saw only mist and the sound of distant water. It did not look like a fall one would survive.

“It does not seem impossible, if we take our time,” Remund Cerdan said. “There is space between the stone and the mosaic to hold on.”

Taking a second look, Angharad saw he was right. More than enough to hold on to the top of the mosaic. The infanzon did not offer to make handholds with his contract and she did not ask – there was not yet a true need to reveal the details of his power, not with an alternative at hand.

“It would be a waste to turn around now,” Lord Zenzele agreed. “We are almost a third of the way through, I believe. Even if we cover only half as many grounds this afternoon, at this pace by tomorrow we would have a path to the end of the maze.”

There was some excitement at that idea. If they had a path, well, the need for ten ‘victors’ could be seen to more leisurely. They could choose the tests undertaken, aim for those giving the best chances of survival. With most in agreement, they got to crossing. Only Song seemed less enthusiastic, and Angharad held back to speak with her.

“Nothing practical,” the Tianxi told her before she could even ask. “It’s the mosaic that trips me. It clearly was part of a shrine at some point, but it no longer is.”

“The Watch mentioned some of the shrine spirits die,” Angharad reminded her.

“That is a dangerous thing, Angharad,” Song murmured. “When a god returns formless to the aether, they leave behind an impression of themselves. It is rarely a kind thing.”

The Pereduri was tempted to dismiss this as Republican superstition but Song had earned better than such talk.

“I will keep an eye out,” she promised.

For once she chose to stay in the middle of the company instead of taking the lead, before Zenzele and behind Yaretzi. Rising on the tip of her toes, she took a look at the space above the mosaic but it was empty save for old dust. She still kept a firm hand on her contract, pulling at a glimpse before she began moving across. Nothing. Again when Inyoni had crossed all the way, Isabel right behind her, but still nothing. Once more, she told herself when halfway through, and-

(Teeth and claws and a blood-curling scream, between Yaretzi’s hands, and she slipped)

-she was already moving by the time the spirit popped out, catching Yaretzi by the collar of her coat and forcefully pressing her against the mosaic as she trembled.

“STEADY,” Angharad shouted over the screaming thing. “Remember it cannot directly hurt us.”

It was not even touching Yaretzi’s hands, she saw, its claws carefully avoiding any contact.

“Lords,” Yaretzi gasped, shivering as she clutched the stone. “Oh, Lords.”

Angharad’s eye stayed on the spirit, whose screeching began to lower in pitch. It looked like a hound eaten up by wriggling worms, half rotten, but the worms did not move and neither did its eyes. After a few seconds the screeching cut out entirely and the creature went still as a stone. That is not a living spirit, Angharad thought. It was not as… aware, or complete. After another few heartbeats it began to crumble from the inside, collapsing into clumps of dust. The stink of them was atrocious, like a rotten corpse. The noblewoman cast glimpses ahead a few more times as they crossed, but there was no second ambush. They made it across without deaths.

The other side was a broad walkway leading up into the airy stairs they had seen earlier. At the end of the steps stood a large domed temple, whose crumbling stone gates were cracked open. Though they were surrounded on all sides by walls so high as to feel as cliffs, there was a sense of open air to the walkway – helped along by the golden light falling from above – that she found enjoyable. She was not alone in that opinion. When Angharad suggested they stop for a meal, as it should be nearing noon, the notion was popular. After that excitement during the crossing all could use the time to settle their nerves.

The fare obtained from the Watch was simple but filling, but there was little conversation. The looming silhouette of the temple was too stark a reminder of what they must soon do.

When they set out Angharad felt sharper for the rest, taking the lead as her crew began climbing the stairs. This particular temple, she saw, was not so ruined as others they had crossed. At the top of the stairs the entrance boasted a floor of elegant turquoise patterns – she shared an amused glance with Yaretzi at the coincidence – and though the gates were broken the antechamber beyond them was a splendid thing. The walls were tiles of moonstone and serpentine, touched with streaks of gold and iron as if someone had painted with the liquid metals.

Age and use had worn a slight groove in the floor that led out into a massive chamber, at the threshold of which Angharad cautiously slowed. Isabel, right behind her, softly gasped at the sights. Not without reason.

The temple was as a single segmented chamber under the great dome they had seen from outside. A polished black marble floor – so polished it seemed a mirror – reflected the exquisite insides of the dome above, a riot of ticking golden gears as an enormous clock. The machinery there connected to the lower chamber on golden threads and pulleys, a hundred mechanisms of gold and iron moving in a strangely harmonious disharmony. Several of the machines on the ground were so large they effectively segmented the room, casting moving shadows on the marble as golden lanterns whirled above. Not a single part of it made a sound.

Angharad slowly stepped onto the marble floor, others following behind.

“Well,” Lady Inyoni said, “at least there’s no need to ask where the spirit is.”

She followed the other woman’s gaze and found that, in her study of the room, she had somehow missed the silhouette sitting cross-legged at the center of it all. It looked like a man, at first glance, but only that for though the contour of the silhouette was perfect, the inside was a madness of copper – gears and wheels and twitching pistons.

“Welcome,” the spirit said, voice like ringing brass.

It seemed much friendlier than the last, so Angharad returned the manners in kind.

“We thank you for your welcome, honored elder,” she said.

The spirit twitched, though there was nothing animal about. It twitched like a clock losing a gear, a carriage tumbling off the road.

“Manners,” the spirit said, surprised. “It has been long.”

There were no eyes inside that silhouette, but somehow she felt the weight of its attention anyway. She came no closer, for politeness did not mean harmlessness, and the others stayed close but behind the invisible line her presence had drawn.

“You seek to cross my temple, yes,” the spirit said. “This can be done, but there must be a test.”

“I would hear the terms of it, honored elder,” Angharad said.

The clockwork spirit twitched again, but this time there was a grinding metal sound and it spit out something. A small golden gear tumbled against the floor, rolling until came at a halt.

“Everything,” the spirit said, “must be measured. Must be earned. Two or more, hold my gear for the agreed amount of time.”

Angharad frowned. That sounded much, much too simple. It twitched.

“And live to the end,” the spirit added. “Victory so long as one survives.”

It was with a fresh eye that Angharad considered the machinery all around them. She now grasped that every part might be used to try and kill her. The Pereduri politely asked for clarification, learning from the spirit that the more of them agreed to take the trial the shorter the time that must be survived would be. Time where the gear was not being held by a living participant would not count towards the total. For all its friendliness, she thought, it was looking to feed.

“Manners,” the spirit approvingly repeated. “I will give reward, good terms. Only they who hold the gear will be in direct peril.”

Angharad blinked in surprise, thanking the spirit before going to confer with the others. Opinions varied.

“Best to go around, I say,” Remund Cerdan said. “It is a large temple and not so ruined, which I cannot trust.”

“If we do not go through here, we may well have to go back through the waterway to find another path,” Zenzele said. “I will not say the test is without risks, but which would be? We will have to take one sooner or later.”

“We can choose who goes in,” Cozme mused, stroking his beard. “It makes the business more manageable, I agree.”

“I would rather take another swim than try this,” Yaretzi frankly said. “Never trust a well-fed god.”

“It seems a test of skill,” Inyoni noted. “Dangerous, yes, but in some ways the fairest kind we may undertake.”

The split was slightly in favor of the attempt. Two against, three for. Isabel desisted from expressing an opinion since she would not be taking the test, saying it would be unseemly, and that left Song as well as Angharad herself. The two shared a look, Song grimacing but not advising against. Dangerous, then, but not impossible to her all too seeing silver eyes.

“Let us attempt it,” she said. “Volunteers only.”

That Angharad should participate was not in doubt and neither were Zenzele and Inyoni’s addition. Master Cozme received Remund’s hesitant permission, but Yaretzi was the true surprise. The Aztlan shrugged at her inquiring look.

“If it must be done, then I would tilt the odds in our favor as much as I can,” she said.

Angharad smiled back, charmed by the sentiment. She was rather pleased Yaretzi had joined their crew. Five of them would need to survive five minutes, beginning the moment one of them picked up the golden gear from the ground. The Pereduri cautiously made certain that the lanterns illuminating the temple would not be snuffed out, which the spirit agreed to speak in the terms. It was, for all its hunger, inclined to fair play. The wager was simple enough: there would be no lantern on the line and a victory would grant all present safe passage across the temple until all who took the trial were dead. Though five would participate, only the individual holding the gear when the test ended would be considered a ‘victor’.

“Let us make sure the minutes mentioned are the same we know,” Inyoni prudently suggested.

The spirit proved this, counting one with them and agreeing that all minutes would be the same length. With that last precaution out of the way, Angharad agreed to the terms.

“Good,” the spirit said, twitching. “Begin when you would.”

But instead of moving, she remained frozen. For a moment, when the spirit had twitched, she had thought she glimpsed something inside its neck. Teeth and red flesh, swallowing. Only she saw nothing of it now, only the clockwork spirit, and she ignored the beating of her heart. Staring too long at spirits was never for the best. She had volunteered to be the one to first take the gear, so she slowly approached it. Slowly enough she could risk more than a glimpse. Angharad thought of dark waters, of the coolness enveloping her, and sunk deep.

(Angharad Tredegar picked up the gear and the chamber came alive.

A forest of cylinders rose from the seamless floor, golden edges like blades turning so quick they were a blur, and a tapestry of golden thread twitched above. Scythes began to fall like pendulums, sharp wheels shot forward and though Angharad danced across the danger she was cornered. She passed the gear to Inyoni after a minute, but the spirit had been methodical: it was cornering them, leaving obstacles in the way. Inyoni passed to Zenzele to avoid a narrow death, who took three steps before he was crushed by a weight. Yaretzi lost her head trying to take the gear from his corpse and-)

She broke the foresight and let out a wet gasp, body shivering as if she had been drenched in ice. She could feel wetness against her eyes but knew it was not tears. Discreetly as she could, she wiped the beads of blood before they could trail down. A flex of her power told her she could still glimpse but that already she was nearing her limit for the day. It had been worth it, to learn that the spirit was not only using the machines but would be leaving them there: every attack on her was an obstacle afterwards, and it would be very easy to get cornered were she not careful.

“Ready?” she called out.

“Ready,” Inyoni shouted back.

She took the gear.

By the time her back straightened the clockwork spirit was gone and the whirling golden blades rising from the mirror-like floor. Breathing out, ignoring the shouts of surprise from her allies, Angharad kept an eye on the machinery around her. A twitch of thread told her the scythe would be coming down a heartbeat before it did, but instead of fleeing she stepped behind one of the risen cylinders. The golden scythe from the ceiling slammed into the whirling blades, the two traps scrapping each other with cacophonous noise. A glimpse told her it would be the wheels next.

Some kind of clockwork engine on the other side of the chamber twitched, shooting out a sharp iron wheel towards her – and then similar machines did the same from three other sides.

“Steady,” Angharad murmured.

The longer she stayed in the center, the harder it would be for the spirit to corner them. Like in her vision, the purpose of the wheels was to force her to leave cover and the moment she stepped away from the scrapped cylinder scythes began to fall one after another. Left, she caught as she stepped around a spinning wheel and a blade filled the space between two whirling cylinders. Right, she saw as a pulley tightened and a bar of solid iron swung through where she had just been standing, rising back up to the ceiling as the arc went all the way through.

A cylinder unlatched itself from its base and wildly went spinning, lethal golden blades scrapping at the floor, and as Angharad fled back towards space filled by a scythe she realized she had been caught. Above her a large mass of gold was being aligned, enough to crush twice over. Thankfully, the others were not far. She chose her successor.

“Zenzele,” she shouted, and threw the gear.

The Malani lord almost fumbled the catch but caught it against his coat. His aunt stayed close, ready to bail him out at moment’s notice, while Angharad breathed in relief and circled around. The test had gone on long enough all had noticed the danger of letting yourself be driven into a corner, so the grisly ends she had seen need not come about. Master Cozme had prudently moved around the scrapyard she had made in the center, positioning himself to have much ground to give when his turn came, so it was Yaretzi that Angharad came close to. She was counting under her breath.

“Over halfway there,” the Aztlan told her.

They stayed together for a while longer, as Zenzele struggled and passed the gear to his aunt – who promptly passed it back to the better-prepared Cozme Aflor. There the spirit struck relentlessly, smashing weights and pistons and scythes after the soldier with a fury Angharad never not seen even in the vision. It wanted a kill. Pieces of machinery went flying, another danger to keep an eye for. She had to pull back Yaretzi when a broken piece of wheel almost took her in the side, though the Aztlan fumbled on her feet and almost tripped her into a spinning cylinder.

“Careful,” Angharad chided, steadying them both.

“Sorry,” the diplomat murmured. “This is… out of my experiences.”

You and I both, she thought. Cozme saw his death writ ahead, so he passed the gear back to Inyoni. Yaretzi, perhaps shamed by the fresh mistake, darted close so the older woman could toss it. She broke into a run, scythes falling in her wake, and as they all felt the trial coming to a close they neared the corner where it would all end.  The spirit lost all subtlety, dropping weights not to kill but to close off paths, and Yaretzi handed the gear to Zenzele. Angharad staked out good open grounds to finish the last of the time, then dipped close to the Malani.

Only he did not pass it, did not have the time to look for that: all four of the cylinders around him unlatched in quick succession, at the right moment in the spin to converge towards him. Angharad cursed, unsheathing and striking at the closest but finding herself too weak to even slow it. Yet Zenzele, impossibly, threw himself down between whirling blades and emerged with only his coat and back cut up as the cylinders violent collided. Already a weight was being aligned above, but his aunt stole the gear out of his extended hand and stepped away.

“TEN,” Yaretzi shouted.

They had it, Angharad saw. Inyoni had an open stretch ahead of her, leading straight into a corner but so long as she did not run too quickly – and the cylinders around her stopped. Angharad glimpsed ahead, ignoring the heat in her veins, but it was a second too late.

“Duck,” she shouted.

Inyoni tried. But every golden blade set in the cylinder came flying out, like a spray of shrapnel, and she could not avoid them all. Two in the leg, one in the torso, and still Angharad held out hope until the older woman stumbled back and fell – revealing the golden blade splitting her skull in half, dug deep between her eyebrows. The corpse toppled down less than a foot again from Zenzele, bloodied and weeping, whose hand clawed as his aunt. He ripped the gear out of her hand, and a heartbeat later machines went still.

The test had come to an end, Zenzele Duma its victor.

—

After, when the grief and the recriminations and the weeping had ebbed low, they gathered themselves and began the trek back to the Old Fort, carrying Inyoni’s mangled corpse.

Thus ended Angharad’s first effort against the Trial of Ruins

# Chapter 24

“So?”

Vanesa frowned down at the papers with the gate mechanisms drawn on them, idly picking at the edge of her missing eye wound. Maryam was a deft hand with charcoal.

 “It is not a lock,” the clockmaker said. “It is much too complex for that. That it is a machine is not in doubt, but the manner of machinery it is trips me up.”

Tristan, crouched at her side, hummed as he glanced at the papers. He taken looks at Maryam’s drawings as well but gotten little out of it. He was a lockpicker, this was several miles past his area of expertise.

“Why?”

The old woman bent over as she leant on her crutches, letting out a small hiss of pain, and tapped the set of metal tiles above the center of the gate.

“See these?” she said. “Their surroundings are full of cogs that would move only if we press the tiles, not unlike an elaborate combination lock, but the section does not connect to most of the mechanisms on rest of the gate.”

“So we are not seeing the whole mechanism?” he ventured.

“Almost certainly,” she said. “I believe that, under all the misdirection, the gate is best understood as three concentric circles.”

She tapped the tiles again.

“First this section, whose tiles will require pressing.”

She then drew a finger in a vague vertical oval shape around the tiles.

“Then this area, which has the most moving parts but no obvious trigger or purpose – my guess is that it connects to something unseen, possibly an aetheric engine.”

To end she drew a circle that swallowed up most of the gate, near the edges.

“We end with a broad ring that bears an underlying circular structure. I should be able to make it rotate when I grasp what makes it move,” Vanesa mused. “It is not a puzzle, Tristan, because the machinery is clearly meant to have some continuous movement. Yet neither is it akin to a clock: it does not seem to be using a fixed unit of measurement.”

“And if you had to guess what the mechanisms do, all used together?” Tristan pressed.

“Whatever it is those tiles decide it should,” Vanesa replied without batting an eye, moving her finger back to them. “Beyond that I could not say without having a look at the hidden parts.”

She paused.

“If you lend me Sarai as eyes and legs,” Vanesa added, “I think I could make out the purpose of the outer ring. It is after that we shall hit a dead end.”

“I will ask her,” Tristan said. “As for the dead end, let me worry about it.”

He had already begun planning how to get up in the pillar, through that opening he had glimpsed last night. The hidden parts that Vanesa was thinking of must be in there. Movement caught his attention, revealing that Maryam and Francho had returned from their belated walk to the shrines, so he parted ways with the old woman. He met Maryam halfway as the old professor kept going, leaving the two of them behind.

“Any trouble?” he asked.

“There is not a soul out there, everyone is in the maze,” Maryam told him. “It was safe enough, though it would be wise not to let him go unescorted anyhow.”

“Agreed,” Tristan said. “And thanks.”

“He is an interesting man and free with conversation,” she shrugged. “It was not much of an imposition.”

“Thanks anyhow,” the thief said. “Vanesa would have your help, if you are willing to lend it.”

“Progress on the gate?” Maryam asked.

“She believes with your help there could be,” Tristan said. “Though I will need to venture in a few dark corners before we get our full answers, I think.”

“Work suited to your nature,” the blue-eyed woman drily said. “You are a natural skulker, Tristan.”

“That is most unkind of you,” he gravely replied.

A beat.

“I took me years to learn such splendid manners of skulking, do not discredit my efforts.”

Maryam’s lips twitched, as did his own. They parted ways without need for anything more, brushing elbows as they went in opposite directions. Francho, looking tired but beaming, had obtained a cup of water and was dutifully sipping at it on one of the kitchen tables. Tristan joined him.

“You look in a fine mood,” the thief observed.

“I have found answers,” the professor said. “That is always a fine thing.”

“You have willing ears as well, should you be inclined share,” Tristan easily replied.

The old man nodded, eyes bright.

“As we suspected, my young friend, it was the Antediluvians that built this place,” Francho said. “That is, the earliest parts of it.”

“The iron gate and the pillar,” Tristan guessed.

And the great golden machine above, though that was not in doubt. Who else built could build the likes of that? The old man nodded, sipping at his cup.

“My surprise,” the professor said, “was in learning it was not men who built the maze and fort.”

The thief breathed in sharply.

“You mean the Watch didn’t bring in all these shrines?”

“Oh no,” the toothless old man grinned. “This is much, much older than the Iscariot Accords – the shrine adorned with a lion head, for example, was brought here during what I believe to be the Century of Loss.”

Tristan counted in his head. The Accords were signed in eighty-one Steel so that was all of Loss and Crowns on top of those eighty-one years. Almost three centuries from a date that was now over three centuries ago. The thief’s brow rose.

“Darklings built this?” he asked.

It was not impossible, he supposed. Hollows were hardly incapable of great works, for all that they tended to be decades – if not more – behind the great powers of Vesper. The Century of Loss was not so long after the collapse of the Second Empire either, they would still have wielded some old wonders.

“Devils built this,” Francho corrected.

He broke out into a wet cough, leaving Tristan to digest the strangeness of what he had just heard. Devils? They were months away from Pandemonium by sail, and though Hell was hardly the only dwelling place of their kind Pandemonium was their only city. But then the maze was not meant to be inhabited, was it? This was merely a kind of outpost, not so uncommon a thing.

“Both the fort and the maze?”

“The fort all at once, from what I can hear, but the maze is the work of centuries,” Francho said.

“And then the Watch took it over,” Tristan muttered. “Why? Why build this place, and why take it?”

“A fascinating mystery,” the old professor enthusiastically said. “I cannot make out devil’s voices as clearly as men’s, especially the young, but I do believe further journeys to the maze will yield some answers.”

“I will be getting word about what lies deeper inside it from of our friends,” Tristan said, absent-mindedly nodding. “That too should be of use.”

“I shall look forward to it,” Francho cheerfully said.

He left the old man to his rest.

It would be hours yet before the maze crews returned, but Tristan did not have time to idle. He had plans for tonight, but to be feasible they first required to Old Fort to be cased. The blackcloaks were generally disinclined to let him onto the ramparts but after some wheedling a sergeant let him under escort for a minute or two. He had not gotten anywhere near the parts of the fort that were off-limits – the barracks, supply depot and northwestern bastion – but now he had a decent idea of where the patrols on the walls would be looking from.

There were quite a few dead angles, if you timed yourself right, which he could. That was the downside of patrolling carrying lanterns, anyone could see you coming.

Getting to the bastion stairs should not be all that difficult, given how many nooks and crannies to hide in he had already found, but once on the stairs it would be difficult. There was always a guard on the wall above the stairs and even if he snuck up onto the bastion there was no cover there: he could be seen from all over the fort. Snuffing out the lanterns was usually his answer to that sort of thing, but this was not the Murk and these weren’t bored street toughs: if a lantern went out, the Watch would go there and look. Besides, there is no way for me to get up that rope ladder quickly enough that I would not be noticed.

Which was a problem, since up that ladder was where he needed to go.

“Make a distraction,” Fortuna suggested. “Like fire.”

“You always suggest fire,” he complained. “What are you the goddess of again?”

“Second-rate thieves, apparently,” the Lady of Long Odds savagely replied.

Tristan mimed taking an arrow to the heart, to her peal of laughter. Her plan would not work for the same reason that snuffing out the lanterns would not. These were professionals, if he made a mess the section of the fort they wanted to keep hidden was the very first part they would lock down. Her suggestion was useful, however, in a way he had learned to cultivate as a child: always consider the very opposite of what Fortuna was advising. ‘Go loudly, using the ladder’ would thus become ‘go quietly, not using the ladder’.

He stared at the pillar, then swallowed.

“You look a little sick,” Fortuna noted.

“Remember when we robbed that printer who’d walled himself in?” he murmured, feigning a yawn.

Gods, the smell. He would never forget that. The golden-eyed goddess looked gleeful.

“You almost knocked yourself out on a gargoyle climbing the tower,” Fortuna remembered with relish.

“This is going to be worse,” Tristan sighed.

Having a closer look at the massive pillar the gate was set in only confirmed his fears. Prying at it with a knife revealed that the surface only looked perfectly smooth because the building stones were covered in a thin layer of that First Empire plaster that didn’t decay – the same from the Alfonsan Baths in Old Town, which stayed pretty no matter how many times they had to wash graffiti off it. That was good news, because that ancient plaster was no harder than the imitations Vesper had since come up with. Picking at the stone beneath he found that the almost seamless junctures had a little give.

Wall hammers and some spikes might be enough, then. The trouble would be how to get them without making it obvious. He went to find Sergeant Mandisa, the tall Malani that was charged with care of the trial-takers, but she was nowhere in sight. When he asked a watchman, he instead found himself dragged before her superior. Lieutenant Wen was eating again, some sort of jerky baton that even the Tianxi’s perfect pearly white teeth seemed to be struggling with.

“I’m not sharing, so stop staring,” the lieutenant bluntly told him. “What do you want Mandisa for?”

“I would like a look through the supplies,” Tristan said.

The lieutenant glanced at his clothes – a long-sleeved black tunic that stopped above his knees, trousers of the same color and standard-issue Watch boots – then cocked an eyebrow. It was quite evident Tristan had already had a look.

“What’s your name?” Lieutenant Wen asked.

“Tristan.”

A spark of recognition in the Tianxi’s dark eyes.

“You know,” the corpulent man said, pushing back his glasses, “when I first enrolled in the Watch the argument of the day was whether or not the Krypteia should be folded into the Academy.”

The largest of the Circles, Tristan knew. The Academy trained officers, the Stripes, which was not so mystical or exciting as Navigators or Militants but significantly more useful in running something as large as the Watch.

“Why?” he asked.

He was, after all, being invited to.

“Because there’s as almost as many Stripes as there as other people in all the other Circles combined while the Krypteia’s by far the smallest,” Lieutenant Wen idly said. “It was a prestige thing, too – there are two guilds in the Guildhouse and three societies in the College. Why shouldn’t the Stripes bring a second Circle under the Academy banner?”

The large Tianxi smiled.

“It got as far as them talking about what the new name for the Stripes would be, since they wouldn’t be the whole Academy anymore, before the scandals started coming out.”

Tristan swallowed a smile. Predictable.

“Turned out those officers were skimming off Conclave funds, contracting off the books or fucking someone they shouldn’t,” Wen said. “Every single one of them. Funny, that. You’d think at least one was clean.”

“Life is full of coincidences,” the thief blandly said.

“That and shallow graves,” the lieutenant smiled. “I dug a little into the archives at the Rook’s Nest, boy, and found out this happens about every fifty years or so – the Academy starts making noises, then there’s a pointed rash of scandals and accidents.”

Tristan blinked.

“And they have not considered simply… stopping?” he slowly said.

“I figure it’s too big a beast to learn, nowadays,” Lieutenant Wen replied. “The Masks only cut off one of the hydra’s heads at a time, so the others keep biting. That’s not the point of this little story, though.”

“I am all ears,” the thief said.

“The point is that Krypteia’s a bunch of shifty assholes not above fucking their brothers and sisters in the black even when they don’t deserve it,” the Tianxi coldly said. “And that if whatever you’re up to hurts any of mine, I will find a way to keep you awake and alive while we hammer our entire supply of nails into your body one at a time.”

The bespectacled lieutenant tapped a finger right between his eyebrows, still smiling.

“Pop,” Lieutenant Wen said. “One at a time, Tristan.”

The Tianxi searched his face, carefully kept blank, then nodded in satisfaction.

“Good,” he said. “Now let’s have a look at those supplies.”

The depot was much the same as when he had last come: half a Watch armory, uniforms and arms included, and the rest piles of arms and clothes from those who had died in the trials. The blackcloaks did not appear to have wall hammers – unsurprisingly, given that it was equipment used mostly by explorers and thieves – but Tristan took from their stock a pair of leather gloves that fitted him well. After that he went fishing through the piles of dead men’s possessions while Lieutenant Wen apathetically resumed struggling with his jerky. Though he found a hammer, it was too large. More a war hammer than a work one.

There was, however, a war pick in a pile with horseman’s leathers. A little heavy, but it had the right parts – beak and hammer – and by the short length of the handle it had been forged for someone shorter than him. It would serve.

“Done?” Lieutenant Wen asked.

“Done,” Tristan lied.

—

Their forge was in the open and its grounds more often used for woodcutting than smith’s work, so it was not difficult to wait until the guards and patrolmen were otherwise distracted and get his hands on a few things. A small hammer, much easier to work with, and a set of twelve large steel bolts likely meant as spares for the oven. He stashed it all away in one of the broken bastions.

—

As afternoon stretched towards evening and Tristan finished his nap, the crews started to return.

Tupoc Xical’s first and in a fine mood. They came strutting back in without a casualty with the only wound cuts on Felis’ leg which the man boasted of, as he’d got them in the process of beating a god’s test. Two victors, they claimed, Felis and Tupoc each having triumphed over a test. Maryam sat with Lan to get a report, learning that their crew had taken the Serpent Shrine. That god’s test, to cross a room full of snakes, was beaten when Tupoc walked through and shrugged off getting bit a dozen times. Lan had checked and he’d suffered no consequence save some sweat. More than that, there was now no trace of any snakebite on his skin.

That, Tristan thought, looked like quite the troublesome contract.

The crew had then spent a long slice of the afternoon breaking their way through a crypt unguarded by any god, taking turns with Ocotlan’s hammer to smash through plaster walls. It led them to some kind of large arena littered with nonsense weapons where another test awaited, seemingly a simple test of strength against a bear but in truth some kind of riddle – Felis, who it turned out was fond of these, ‘slew’ the bear with a sort of paper fan whose name could also mean honeycomb. He took a slash to the leg getting close, but a shallow one. Lan thought he had gotten very lucky already knowing the riddle and insisted he had been completely insufferable since.

They had hit the equivalent of a dead end when they were presented a choice between a broken bridge and a temple whose test was too brutal – a god demanding they play some kind of game of chance where every loss would mean losing a finger or toe. They were now preparing equipment, ropes and hooks, to try to cross the broken bridge on the morrow.

The crew under the Ramayans stumbled in an hour later, haggard and a collection of wounds. Ishaan Nair had a disfiguring cut going up through both his lips, Ferranda Villazur was limping on a bandaged leg, Brun and Acanthe’s faces were red as if brushed too close to flame and Yong’s topknot had been sliced off – his hair fell in uneven disorder. Only Shalini Goel looked unscathed, but at least they did not seem to have lost anyone. Tristan himself sat with Yong for the report.

“The Lion Shrine was easy enough,” Yong told him. “One of us was to run a gauntlet of ten duels against the shades of increasingly larger beasts – and could withdraw, but only at the price of a pint of blood. Goel breezed through, finished almost every fight within the first three breaths. Never seen anyone so fast with pistols.”

Another likely contract.

“And after?”

Yong grimaced.

“We found a shortcut, a narrow overpass that went on for half a mile,” he said. “No railings and high up, but not so difficult if we took our time. Only it was older than we’d thought.”

“It collapsed,” Tristan guessed.

“We got lucky,” the Tianxi sighed, confirming with a nod. “We fell into water, some kind of shallow canal, and the only one to get hurt was Ferranda. We followed the current, as it was headed the right way, but it led to some kind of waterfall facing furnaces.”

“Brun and Acanthe Phos look burned,” Tristan said.

“A tongue of fire flared out, came close to catching them when they were looking over the waterfall’s edge,” Yong said. “It was a dead end so we had to double back against the current. The canal was fed into by some kind of stormdrain, so we went up that and reached a crossroads with four shrines.”

The dark-haired man let out a long breath.

“We agreed we needed to secure a way back first, so we tried the one leading back towards the Old Fort,” Yong said. “It seemed straightforward enough: a test of skill with pendulum blades to avoid in order to reach the other end of the room. The terms were generous, even – no lantern bet, only it must be at least two of us taking the test.”

“You and Ishaan,” the thief said.

Yong grunted in agreement.

“It was a trap,” he said. “The chamber itself began spinning and more blades came out of the other walls. Nothing larger than a mouse could cross that room without losing limbs, not with so many moving parts. Even just getting out got us cut.”

“So how did you return?” he asked.

“We went over the shrine, climbed up the sides,” Yong said. “Which the god took offence to: it collapsed its own shrine’s ceiling. Two heartbeats quicker and it would have killed Ferranda.”

They had doubled back to the Old Fort after that, the Tianxi elaborated, and avoided taking any more tests. It had meant taking long and exhausting detours that further chipped away at everyone’s mood. With so many wounds and a single victor to show for it, their first day did not feel like a success. The mood of the Ramayan crew was downcast and stayed that way as they patched their wounds and planned the following day’s expedition while Felis strutted about, loudly telling others of his cleverness in the test he had beat.

It was only when Angharad Tredegar came back carrying a corpse that perspective set in.

Inyoni Duma had been butchered by some sort of large cutting implement, by the looks of it, and her wounded nephew was walking a ragged edge. His eyes were red and the glint in them wild, just itching for something to lash out at. Much as Tristan wanted to find out what had happened to their crew, Zenzele Duma’s look warned him off it. His instincts were proved right when within half an hour the Malani ended up smashing Felis’ face in after the man boasted a little too mockingly. They were pulled off each other by their crews, but the thief decided to steer well clear.

The only angle he could see for getting eyes in that crew was Yaretzi, and he would not risk that without first getting a better read on her.

Perhaps aware that the day’s course did little to strengthen her crew’s position, Shalini did not approach him at dinner for recruitment again. Tristan sat with the other homebodies, only half paying attention to the conversation as he watched the undercurrents of the rest of the table. A corpse being brought in had settled the mood in the Ramayan crew somewhat, but it was still shaky. Ironically enough, Tredegar’s own company seemed more united than they. Whatever the nature of the death, it did not seem to have shaken their faith in the Pereduri.

As for Tupoc, his unambiguous victories were propping up his position. Already his crew looked less like they were waiting for the gallows and tough the Izcalli himself was still disreputable the others under him were not being treated as if they carried the plague anymore. That tentative thaw would not last if the streak of successes broke, Tristan thought, but if it continued… Something to keep an eye on. After the meal and some huddled talks between the crews after it, most headed for bed. It had been a long and bloody day, with tomorrow promising to be much the same.

For Tristan, however, night was the beginning of the work.

He had napped through the afternoon for a reason: there was precious little sleep ahead of him.

—

There was no curfew in the Old Fort, so it was a simple matter of timing.

Beatris had gone on a walk around the courtyard at two past midnight, the previous evening, so a little before that Tristan snuck out of his bedroll and slipped into the kitchen. When she came out with her blackcloak escort, same as last night, he came out of the shadows and sat down at a table facing her. He made sure that his hands would be flat on top of the table and there were no visible weapons on him, making it clear he was no threat.

He was still faced with a naked sword within moments.

“Back to your bed,” the watchman flatly ordered.

Tristan ignored the armed man, instead seeking Beatris’ eyes. She hesitated for a moment but ended up nodding.

“It is fine, Sergeant Chabier,” Beatris said. “Tristan is an old acquaintance, this is not an unpleasant surprise.”

The watchman hesitated but she smiled.

“I would talk with him a moment, if you please,” Beatris said. “We can resume our walk afterwards, yes?”

The man sheathed his sword, but his eyes were still hard.

“Say the word if you need me,” Sergeant Chabier said. “You are under the Watch’s protection now, to harass you is a breach of sanctuary rules.”

Ah, confirmation that Beatris had withdrawn from the trials. He had been nearly certain, but it was good to know for sure. The watchman stepped away, far enough he would not be able to listen in but hardly a step further than that. Tristan ignored his glaring. He had come here for answers and he would have them.

“Do you still have the ruby?” he idly asked.

Beatris’ jaw clenched.

“I promise to keep an ear out for you,” she acknowledged. “I’ll not go back on that. What do you want to know?”

First something he had been itching to know, however marginal the use of holding that information.

“Why is Isabel Ruesta still taking the trials?” Tristan asked. “The cousin she wanted to pursue is dead.”

Beatris softly laughed.

“She fucked herself,” the other rat told him. “Lord Ruesta only let her risk the Dominion because she told him she was trying to choose between the Cerdan brothers. She argued that danger would let her see the true face of them.”

“Only she does not want to marry either,” the thief slowly said.

Unusually sensible of the infanzona.

“She despises them,” Beatris snorted. “She goaded the Cerdans into following her because they are so awful she would lose no sleep over sacrificing them.”

Tristan hummed.

“But now she is stuck,” he laid out. “Her way out was seducing the cousin, but the man is dead. Worse, Augusto was revealed to be unsuitable so if she withdraws from the trials then she will be married off to Remund.”

That was why you needed to be careful with cover stories: sometimes you ended up having to live up to them. Tristan had got off light pretending he was deaf for a month.

“She would rather cut her own feet off than marry the shit,” Beatris confidently said. “She has dozens of better prospects wriggling on her hooks back in Sacromonte.”

And the simplest way out of her blunder was hardly difficult to figure out.

“So she must stick around to ensure our friend Remund has an accident,” Tristan mused.

One had to commend Lady Isabel for her industriousness: not yet married and already she was arranging the divorce. It appeared that the issue of lacking eyes and ears among Angharad Tredegar’s crew would not be so unsurmountable a problem after all. The infanzona should be quite willing to pass information in exchange for a little help on the path to preemptive widowhood.

Why, he was almost beginning to approve of Isabel Ruesta: what rat would not applaud a snake intent on eating others of her kind?

“Tell me about Brun,” he asked.

Beatris looked surprised.

“I didn’t think you cared much about him and Ren,” she said, then worried her lip.

She spent a little while in thought.

“He decided early on that Tredegar was the ally to secure and he went after it straightforwardly,” Beatris said. “He was also courting Briceida, but…”

She hesitated. Tristan leaned in.

“But?”

“I’m not sure I buy it,” Beatris admitted. “He’s Murk, I could tell even if she couldn’t, and she was never shy about her opinion of rats.”

Oh? That was interesting. Tristan had suspected the man to be, for he did not act like some shopkeeper’s son, but that had been only a guess.

“You’re sure?” he asked.

She nodded.

“Tredegar mentioned his parents were Trench miners,” Beatris said.

More than decent odds, then, as not even the foremen of the Trench could claim to live well.

“It’s strange, though,” the former maid continued. “He got restless when we began to run out of food, even Lady Isabel noticed.”

And a rat should be used to a little hunger, Tristan finished. That was unusual.

“Contract?” he asked.

“Something that allows him to feel when people get close,” Beatris shrugged. “He stayed vague about it.”

Some kind of detection contract? Not what he would have associated with a god that Fortuna called loud, but the goddess did not think the way a human might. ‘Loud’ to her could very well mean a different thing entirely. Perhaps the means of detection were loud to other gods, or somehow garish. Or he is acting odd because his god sticks closely to him, Tristan considered. He too acted in way that seemed strange from an outside eye because of Fortuna’s foibles. Brun might simply be a skilled operator making the best of his circumstances and nothing more nefarious.

Time would tell.

“Song Ren,” he asked.

“Hates Lady Isabel’s guts and isn’t all that good at hiding it,” Beatris said. “It got worse as we travelled together.”

“Yet she is sticking with the remains of your old crew,” Tristan informed her. “Including Isabel Ruesta.”

That clearly surprised the other Sacromontan.

“She was tight with Lady Angharad,” Beatris slowly said, “or at least trying to be.”

“In a bedsport way?”

The dark-haired woman shook her head.

“I would say sisterly, but that’s not quite it either,” Beatris said, biting her lip. “It was almost as if she was humoring Tredegar by letting her take the lead. I do not believe she saw herself as subordinate the way Brun did.”

Maryam had never said why it was she had gone with the leftovers during the Trial of Lines. A demonstration of Signs or even just the map she had memorized would have seen her added to Inyoni’s company in a heartbeat. Yet instead she had stuck with him, much as Song was sticking with Angharad Tredegar. Special enrolment, the thief thought. Maryam had admitted that she and Song were there for the same reason and the way they acted was telling. They were making allies not for just for these trials but for what would come after, the secret opportunity that would be afforded to the recommended.

Maryam had picked him and Song had picked Angharad Tredegar.

“You put something together,” Beatris said, eyes intent.

“Maybe,” Tristan demurred. “I cannot be sure.”

“Maybe,” she softly said. “But you are anyway.”

The thief hid his irritation at being seen through. He was losing his touch of late.

“Who are you really, Tristan?” Beatris asked. “You’re not just some boy from the Murk.”

She stared him down.

“Those don’t murder hardened killers twice their size and make it look like an accident within hours of meeting them.”

It seemed boldness was making an appearance now that the protection of the Watch made her all but untouchable. She was overplaying her cards, however. He could not touch her, but neither could she touch him. That would be interfering in the trials and the moat she was hiding behind went both ways. So instead of answering he rose to his feet, ignoring the wariness on her face to offer her his hand to shake.

“Good luck,” he said, “in Sacromonte.”

Her face tightened.

“That’s it?”

He shrugged.

“What else should there be?”

They were rats keeping to their common law and with this conversation all their debts were settled. Tristan would keep no grudge over their dealings, which had been fairer than not, but a choice had been made before they ever left the Bluebell: they were bound by transaction and nothing more. She was not Maryam, who had chosen him and been chosen in turn. Beatris stared at him, gaze searching for something, but whatever it was she did not find it. Her eyes strayed away.

“Goodbye, Tristan,” Beatris said.

She did not shake his hand and he did not offer it again.

What was the best way not to be caught?

It was, sometimes, to be caught for something else entirely. When people were certain of where you were and why you were there, they put you in the box of affairs that were settled. Tristan, for example, had been out at night but his purpose was obvious: he had been trying to speak with Beatris. So when he trudged back to his bedroll afterwards and closed the curtain behind him, he shed the suspicions of the Watch. They had accounted for him, he went into the box.

That made it much easier to sneak out a second time a little over an hour later.

The timing was careful. Like the previous night a light appeared high on the pillar, above the bastion with the astronomical equipment, and a rope ladder was lowered. Six watchmen came down, all of them heading straight for the barracks, and in their wake a seventh followed. Unlike the others she did not head down the bastion stairs, instead setting down a sheath of papers on a table and busying herself with the telescope. She was, Tristan saw, looking at the machinery above – the one whose golden moving parts mimicked the sky, stars and moons moving around.

Pressed close in the shadows below the bastion, Tristan waited until Fortuna returned from having her look. She strutted back as if she had single-handedly won a war, which in truth was not all that different from her usual walk.

“She looks Someshwari,” the goddess confirmed. “Thirties or very kind forties.”

Tristan smiled. There was a decent chance, then, that as deduced last night he had found the missing Lieutenant Vasanti. He had not been able to find out during the day how many watchmen there were in the Old Fort, as from a distance their black cloaks made them very difficult to tell apart, but he doubted there could be many posted up there. The practicalities of food and shit would dictate otherwise: even a chamber pot needed to be emptied eventually. He must make the climb now, though, for eventually the soldiers that had come down would be replaced or themselves return.

Getting out of the Old Fort was not all that difficult, as the Watch kept an eye mostly on the openings in the walls. Climbing down the side of the northeastern bastion with his tools wrapped in a blanket was slow work more than strenuous. It was after that, when he stood outside the fort in one of the blind angles of the ramparts, that the real work began. Taking out the work hammer and a few spikes, he began to hammer himself a way up. The way to do it without noise was to hammer the spike through cloth, to kill the echo, but that made precision difficult.

Tristan had long been trained out of any fear of heights – it would be too much of a disability for a thief – but he still found his nerves thinning as he rose up the side of pillar. His boots rested on spike after spike while he nailed one above, at the precise intersection of the building stones under the plaster so the length of steel would slide in securely. His work slowed further when he got halfway up and began pulling every third spike with the side of the war pick, for otherwise he was sure to run out before the end. His muscles ached and his limbs began to tremble from the tension, but by the time he’d got to the right height he saw that he had been blessed with a stroke of luck.

Lieutenant Vasanti had left the bastion with the telescope, going to the supply depot, which left him an open path.

The last stretch was the worst. It was the easiest to hammer in, for now that he had gone up the pillar he was following the curve of the stone towards the entrance where the rope ladder led, but he was exhausted and uncomfortably aware that all it would take for a blackcloak to see him was someone shining a lantern in his direction. Below he could see a few watchmen spread across the walls, a few walking around the ramparts. None cared to look up so he remained safely hidden in the shadow of the great pillar, shielded from the golden light of the aether machine above.

He was careful not to leave a trail, removing every spike he did not stand on, and about an hour after he had begun Tristan found himself about a foot below the opening in the pillar from which dangled the rope ladder. Pressed into the shadows below that slender opening, he was hidden from below – and needed to be, for Lieutenant Vasanti and another blackcloak had returned to the bastion. They were talking, discussing charts by the telescope, but if the rope ladder began to move they were sure to notice. Instead Tristan stretched up from the spike, hoisting himself onto the stone, and wriggled inside. Scorch marks, he noticed as he crawled on the floor. They blew their way in.

And then he’d made it in.

There was no telling what the chamber had been before the Watch moved in: the walls and ceiling were bare stone, with only small marks betraying that at some point weighty objects had been dragged across the floor. It had since been turned into an outpost that could not quite decide what it was mean to be: a handful of bedrolls were propped up against the left wall, a rack of swords and muskets the right one, and in the back there was some kind of office. Stacks of papers were piled up everywhere around a wooden desk and the small cabinet flanking it. There was only one seat, a broad chair behind the desk, and that was where Tristan’s eyes stayed.

There was someone sleeping in it.

An old woman in a black cloak, white-haired and wrinkled. She snored away, cheek pressed on top of the desk, and slightly drooled on the wood. Given the Someshwari look of her and the seniority implied by age – she had to be in her sixties at least – Tristan realized that he had been wrong after all: it had not been Lieutenant Vasanti on the bastion, because he was looking at her now. She looked frail, but there was a pistol atop a pile of papers that would make that point moot.

His climb had been quiet and he had not woken her by entering the chamber, but he still felt stomach clench: there was almost no cover in the room to hide behind. He could not stay out in the open, he was sure to be caught, so the thief smoothed out his breathing and looked for the exit. There was bound to be one, no one would set up in this eagle’s nest without a reason. As he’d thought, tucked away besides the bedrolls was a discreet opening of the wall through which he glimpsed stairs in the flickering light of the chamber’s sole lamp. There was, despite sweeping the room twice, no sign of anywhere leading down. An isolated chamber?

The size of this room was no more than a third of the great pillar’s length, at a look, so there might be others carved inside the stone. Regardless, up the stairs was the way he must head. He would find no answers here, only get caught by the Watch.

Creeping across the floor on all fours, careful not to make a sound as he moved towards the bedrolls and the stairs, the thief kept an eye on the sleeping officer. One foot after another, until he was halfway through the row of bedrolls – and then the snoring stopped. Tristan pulled at his luck before he even turned to look, only realizing his mistake when he saw Lieutenant Vasanti had not moved. Her eyes were still closed and she still lay on top of the desk. Shit, he had borrowed luck for nothing. That was… no, best get up the stairs before releasing it. It was too dangerous out here.

He began to move again, only to be given pause when he heard someone pulling at a stuck drawer. He hurried to his feet only for Lieutenant Vasanti to curse, snatching the pistol atop her desk and firing a shot right into his chest. A plume of smoke came bursting out, and as he threw himself down to the right the thief only spared a moment of incredulity at this being luck – only for the explosion of pain he was awaiting not to come.

“Ovya,” the old woman cursed. “Gods, girl, but I will have you caned until you learn to load your pistol properly.”

There had been, he realized, no ball to go with the powder.

Tristan released the luck, preparing himself for disaster, and still missed it: the weapons rack fell onto his back as he began to rise, a mass of wood and a dozen swords crashing down onto him. He wriggled free, hearing the sound of a drawer forced open, but by the time he got onto his knees with a few bruises to show for it a cool muzzle was pressed against his forehead.

Lieutenant Vasanti’s rheumy green eyes were cold as the steel she held in her hand.

“Move and die,” the old woman said. “Understood?”

“Understood,” Tristan replied.

Could he get free of this? Pulling on the luck again, most likely. It was what came after that worried him. There was a witness to him being inside the pillar. He was not, strictly speaking, breaking the rules by being here. The pillar was not off-limits, the way the barracks and bastion were. Yet it was impossible for him to have come here without having broken the rules, an offence Lieutenant Wen had made clear would earn summary execution.

“You’re one of the kids from the trials, yes?” Lieutenant Vasanti said.

He did not answer, so she pressed the muzzle forcefully against his skin.

“Yes,” he said.

He could not see a way out of this without killing the watchwoman, which would not be an act without consequences. And a shot was fired, we are bound to have been heard. Other blackcloaks would be on their way. Was all already lost? Would killing her be pointless?

Either way, Tristan must make his decision soon.

“Name?” she pressed.

He hesitated, but saw her hand begin to clench.

“Tristan Abrascal.”

“You’re one of the Cryptic prospects,” Lieutenant Vasanti grunted. “One of the two died, I heard, so which are you?”

He blinked.

“I don’t know,” he slowly said.

A moment passed and he settled into the decision. He saw only one way to survive, and though it might see him die later it was always better to breathe than not. He would strike when she got distracted.

“Fuck,” the old woman feelingly said. “You’re too calm. You’re Nerei’s pet project, aren’t you?”

He paused.

“Abuela?” he ventured.

“Grandmother,” she translated, disgust rippling across her face. “Gods, that’s sick.”

A sigh and the pistol went up.

“On your feet, boy,” Lieutenant Vasanti said. “I should shoot you for sneaking in here, but you’re not worth a feud with Nerei. There are too many ways to make it look like an accident at my age.”

Tristan, disoriented by the realization that he was not going to have to kill his way out of this after all, hesitantly rose to his feet. He flicked a worried glance backwards.

“There’s no one coming,” the watchwoman told him. “This entire construction swallows noise: the Makers did not want the machinery noises to echo around the cavern.”

Lieutenant Vasanti stepped away from him, going to sit atop her desk after pushing aside a few papers.

“So you got curious and decided to go sniffing around our work, did you?” she said.

Tristan weighed his options, trying to get a read on her face and finding that there was little there to find but steel.

“The maze can’t be the only way through,” he decided to risk. “The pillar is much older, and the Antediluvians would have needed access to the machinery in the ceiling.”

“Been a while since a trial-taker figured that out,” Lieutenant Vasanti noted. “We try to keep them looking forward instead of up.”

“There’s something wrong with this place,” Tristan quietly said. “This was not built to be a trial, even if the Watch turned it into one.”

The old woman considered him coolly.

“Best you keep that tongue in your mouth, boy.”

She tapped the side of her pistol against her fingers thoughtfully.

“What to do with you now?”

Punishment, even if he was not killed, but the thief could not afford that. It would all come falling down on his head if he was made an example of now, even if he got away with a mere caning or flogging. She’s the key, Tristan thought as he watched Lieutenant Vasanti. So what did he have to move her? Nothing, at a glance, but that was never true. What did he know? Old but still a lieutenant, he thought, which was unusual. She knew Abuela, or claimed to, and had Maryam not said that the seal Abuela used to recommend him was the mark of a high rank? She had also implied that she had seen more than a year of trials being taken.

Lieutenant Wen had said there was a tinker from the Umuthi Society at the Old Fort, when going on one of his grisly rants.

The pieces came together.

“How far did you get in finding the way up?” he asked.

Lieutenant Vasanti stilled.

“Definitely one of Nerei’s,” she said. “You have the same unpleasant nose for secrets.”

“That’s why you’re here, isn’t it?” he said. “For the aetheric machine above. I’ll bet you even took a demotion so you could stay assigned at the Old Fort.”

“Sometimes it can be hard to tell,” the old woman said, “whether you’re digging out of a grave or digging it deeper. Would you like me to tell you which it is you’re doing, boy?”

“Lieutenant Wen said there was a tinker,” he said. “A tinker. This isn’t a Watch study, you would have a team for that. It’s yours.”

“Clever,” Lieutenant Vasanti acknowledged. “But cleverness does not impress me. What does that matter?”

Tristan straightened, put a confident smile on his face.

“Ihave a team for you,” he said. “A clockmaker, a historian with a contract, a Sign-user and even eyes in the maze for those things the Watch won’t led you send people to look for.”

The old lieutenant went still, studying him with unblinking green eyes.

“You think I’ll let you dig at our secrets just because you have some tools for me to use, boy?”

His façade of calm did not waver. I think you have less than a decade to live and you chose to be here, eating bad food on this misbegotten island with none of your old friends. I think that telescope isn’t Watch equipment at all, that you had it brought in, and for you to do that you must have been here for years now.

“Yes,” Tristan simply replied.

A heartbeat of silence, then the old woman laughed. She set down her pistol on the table and it was an effort not to let out a breath of relief.

“I can’t help but notice you didn’t put yourself in the list,” Lieutenant Vasanti said. “But that’s fine, Tristan Abrascal.”

Her grin was neither pretty nor friendly.

“I have a use for you too.”

 



# Chapter 25

It was a grim supper.

After the day’s bloody price none were in a chatting mood and Angharad discreetly asked Song to stay close to Zenzele, lest he lose his temper and strike another again. Felis had been acting tastelessly enough that none had made a fuss over the brawl, but if the Malani had to be dragged out of another scrap she suspected sympathy would wane. Isabel, who sat by her side as they dug into their plates of salted pork, biscuits and peas, leaned close.

“Only one victor for Lord Ishaan’s crew,” she murmured. “And there appear to be some recriminations over the results.”

She was right, Angharad saw. Lady Ferranda and Acanthe Phos were arguing, however quietly, while Ishaan Nair attempted to play peacemaker. The others only watched.

“We have our own troubles,” Angharad finally said. “Best to leave them to their own.”

She was the only leader to have brought back a corpse as well as victors, which would make her singularly unsuited to poaching even if she were of such a mind. Which she was not.

“Not so great as that,” Isabel said. “Lord Zenzele is grieving, as is only proper, but who has spoken to you of leaving?”

No one, so far, but they had not been back for long. They would see. It was draining, to have to consider all that. Life had been so much simpler when she was but a duelist on the circuit, her rule of Llanw Hall a distant thing Father still had decades to prepare her for. Her mother had been a lady and a captain, so authority was in her blood, but she did not think is came as naturally to her. Would Mother have always taken charge if she found it out as exhausting as Angharad did? She had her doubts.

Someone staring at her, but when she turned Remund was speaking with Cozme. Strange.

After the meal they lingered at the table a little longer, expectant looks sent her way, but Angharad had no clever plan to dazzle them with. She told them to rest and prepare, receiving only nods in return, and they went their own way. Cozme Aflor, however, sought her out after the others were gone. He made small talk at first but kept pulling at his beard and hardly met Angharad’s eyes. Eventually he came out with the reason he had approached her in the first place.

“Lord Zenzele is not so wounded that he cannot come tomorrow,” he said. “The Watch physician said the cuts on his back required no stitches, only thorough cleaning.”

“Flesh is not what was cut deepest today,” Angharad replied.

The older man smoothed his mustache, which had been entirely pristine.

“I feel for Lord Zenzele, I truly do,” Cozme Aflor said. “Yet his grief cannot see him withdraw from the crew in all but name.”

“He is a victor,” she pointed out.

“So is Lady Isabel,” the older man said, “and if one stays so will the other. What is left of us then?”

Not much, she had to admit. Herself, Song, Yaretzi, Cozme and Remund. They would be the smallest of the crews, if not necessarily the weakest, but size was what concerned Master Cozme. A crew of five was certain to force Remund Cerdan to take a trial, which his protector was trying to avoid by keeping their numbers high – even it meant taking Zenzele Duma back into the maze. It was good and loyal service to House Cerdan, this conversation. Angharad bade herself to keep that in mind, for otherwise she might grow angry.

“I am not certain what it is you wish of me, Master Cozme,” she finally said.

“He respects you, Lady Angharad,” he replied. “You held the cog the longest of us and almost saved her life at the end. If you request that he continue with us tomorrow, he may well listen.”

For the barest of moments, she felt like striking him. What had Cozme Aflor given in these trials, that he had earned of her the right to ask that she wade through a man’s grief to make demands for another’s benefits? Only Cozme was not asking for himself, and that let her swallow the anger. It was not selfishness that drove the request but duty.

“I would not see our crew sunder,” Angharad stiffly said.

Tacit agreement. She, too, could see how victors remaining behind could be the beginning of the end for their band. For the remainder the temptation would grow to seek refuge with Lord Ishaan instead of remaining on a sinking ship.

“I make no promises,” Angharad said.

“Nor would I ask one,” Master Cozme hurried to say.

He looked relieved. Perhaps he had reason to be. Dimly left with the sense that she was doing another’s dirty work, Angharad walked away from the man and sought out Zenzele. The Malani was alone, sitting in his ‘room’ with the curtain open, for though Song was close and keeping an eye on him she had not gone to speak with him. At a glance, Zenzele Duma looked fine. He had bandages wrapped around his torso but his back was straight and he seemed in no great discomfort. His hair was too short to have the capacity to be disheveled and even his hat – brimmed, pinned and feathered as was the current fashion in Malan – was set at a jaunty angle.

It was the eyes that gave him away.

Red-rimmed and raw, like a wound had been drawn around two pits of bleakness. Angharad’s steps almost faltered, for what might she possibly say to a man with eyes like these, but she forced herself to keep moving. The glance he flicked her way when she came to stand before him was disinterested.

“May I sit?” Angharad asked.

Zenzele gestured wordlessly. She lowered herself onto the stone, leaning back against the partition between his stable stall-turned-room and what she suspected had been Inyoni’s. Twice she almost began to speak before biting down on the words. They felt fake, hollow. The kind she would have raged to hear in the days fresh after the massacre of her family. It was him that broke the silence.

“You told us,” Zenzele said, “that you are the last of your house.”

“Save for my uncle in the Watch,” Angharad quietly agreed.

Not that it meant anything. Uncle Osian had renounced any claim to Llanw Hall by becoming a blackcloak, just as she would. There was no longer a claim left to press, anyhow: House Tredegar had been struck from the rolls of nobility. The land would become the possession of the High Queen, who would grant it to another family at her pleasure.

“How did it happen?”

Her fingers clenched.

“They came in the night,” she said. “Steel and powder, before they put our very hall to the torch.”

Her cousins had been but boys, but sometimes she hoped they had been put to the sword. Better the steel than being barred inside their rooms, burning alive as so many of the servants had. Not until her dying day would she forget the sound of those screams on the wind.

“And you fled,” Zenzele said.

“My father had a riverboat stashed away,” Angharad murmured. “He died distracting them long enough for me to reach it.”

Had Father known what would find her on that dark river, rowing alone on a trail of ink? Sometimes she thought he might have. He had been a learned man, keeping to old ways. Unknowing of her mind, the Malani breathed out deeply.

“My mother has four other children,” he abruptly said. “I am the thirdborn, which means marrying for advantage.”

The same fate Uncle Osian had gone to the Watch to avoid. It was considered imprudent to marry the secondborn out of the family, but any child beyond that number was fated for the marriage market. Angharad would likely have wed a thirdborn daughter before she reached twenty, arranging in the marriage contract for a son of that family to stand in for their daughter when she decided to conceive an heir for House Tredegar.

“Mother never really gave a shit beyond ensuring I would be a decent prospect,” Zenzele confessed. “I used to think I had disappointed her, but looking back she simply never really saw me as a Duma. I was born to marry out.”

He shook his head.

“Sometimes I think she didn’t even notice when I left to attend the isikole,” he said. “It was Aunt Inyoni who saw me off, rode with me on the wagon.”

He trailed off.

“Is it there you met Ayanda?” she asked, prompting him to continue.

A spasm of grief. Best that wound be lanced now, lest what lay within fester.

“Under the red roof there are no titles,” he quoted. “For four years it didn’t matter that she wasn’t nobly born, only that she was lovely and funny and so fucking clever. It felt like a dream she even wanted to be with me.”

“Then the four years ended,” Angharad said.

“And out in Malan, nothing else matters,” Zenzele bitterly said. “I had not even taken off my traveling cloak before Mother told me I was betrothed.”

She winced.

“Arafa Sandile,” he said. “Only two years older than me. Pretty, they said. But even if she had looked like a seal I would have been promised to her, because the Sandile silver mines are prettier to my mother than any girl could ever hope to be.”

Even Angharad had heard of House Sandile. In southern Malan they were a byword for extravagance, the main line having once thrown a feast on a ship being carried through the countryside by elephants imported from the Imperial Someshwar. It had been the talk of the Isles for years afterwards. No wonder Zenzele had run after breaking his betrothal: the Sandile had deep enough pockets to bury him neck deep in swordmasters after such a slight to their honor. Zenzele chuckled.

“That’s about the face Aunt Inyoni made when I told her I was going to run,” he said. “She said I wouldn’t make it ten miles out, much less as far as a port. Then she said she couldn’t just let me get myself killed.”

His face tightened.

“She was more a mother to me than the woman who spat me out into the world,” he said. “Then and now. And how did I repay it?”

Angharad knew that rage in the man’s eyes, the urge to strike something stoked all the higher by the way there was nothing around worthy of being struck. The first time an assassin had come for her, it had been as much a relief as a thing of dread. Finally she had been able to hurt someone for what had been done to her, someone deserving of her hatred.

“Sleeping God, but when we set out it felt like an adventure,” he hatefully said. “Terrifying, we were leaving it all behind, but I was with Ayanda and the only family I cared to claim. Aunt Inyoni’s friends in the Watch were interested in our contracts, enough to recommend us, and all we needed was to win some trials and we would be forever beyond anyone’s reach.”

His jaw clenched.

“I thought I could get it all,” Zenzele said. “Instead I killed them both.”

Angharad could have told him that he was not to blame, that both the dead had made choices and he had not decided for them, but she knew it would mean nothing. It had not to her when she heard the same truths, for they held the ring of platitude.

“When a shot is fired,” she said, “who is to blame – the bullet, the powder, the flint that struck the spark?”

His eyes moved to her.

“Blame the finger that pulled the trigger, Zenzele Duma,” Angharad said. “You did not run away on a whim, you were made to.”

To marry for the good one one’s family was duty, but to be treated by cattle by the head one one’s house – not even consulted during the negotiations, never meeting the other party before the betrothal – was undeniably a wrong. A nobleborn child had responsibilities to their house, but that house also had responsibilities to them and the Duma had failed Zenzele before he them. It did not make running admirable, but it was enough for Angharad not to look down on the man for it.

“So I should take my revenge on them, is that it?” the Malani snorted. “Make myself a kinslayer, maybe wipe out House Sandile?”

Angharad Tredegar did not laugh, did not so much as twitch a smile. There was no jest here.

“One day,” she said, voice soft, “I will find out who it was that murdered my family, who ended my house.”

That man’s name, the owner of all her grief.

“And when I do, Zenzele,” she continued. “I will kill them all. Every last one of them.”

Her fingers clenched, nails biting into her palm.

“No matter how far they run, how high they stand, how many armies stand between them and my blade. I will drag their screaming souls to the ashes of Llanw Hall and let the wailing reach all the way across the fucking Circle Perpetual to my kin.”

Let it be the first thing her parents heard as they were born anew, let those screams come thundering out their lungs as their souls wiped clean and avenged returned to Vesper for another life.

“This,” she said with utter calm, “I have sworn. And I will live long enough to carry out that oath, no matter what this pit of horrors sets in my way.”

Zenzele stared at her, still as a statue.

“So that’s what it is,” he said. “An oath.”

She blinked, taken aback.

“I can see connections,” Zenzele Duma admitted in a murmur. “Between things, people, concepts. You are tied to Isabel Ruesta and to Song Ren, but there is a chord deeper and more vivid than both.”

He met her eyes.

“It is red,” he said. “Red like blood, like flame, like ruin. That may well be what it brings you.”

“They were already brought to me,” Angharad Tredegar gently replied. “I am simply to return that gift in kind.”

The Malani wrenched his gaze away as if burned.

“Live to take revenge, huh,” he said. “Somehow I expected something nobler of you, Angharad.”

“Fire is not a kind thing,” she murmured. “But it does keep the night away, Zenzele.”

The Malani stayed silent for a long time.

“I don’t know if I have it in me to live like that,” he said. “But it doesn’t matter.”

His jaw firmed.

“I will not suffer her body to be abandoned in some pit, her affairs pawned off to some other trial-taker in the years to come,” Zenzele Duma said. “Ayanda is beyond my reach, but I will see my aunt’s ashes spread on the shores of the Isles one day.”

Angharad felt a sliver of grief on his behalf, that he would never get so much as a pinch of ash to spread from the girl he had so deeply loved. No one would go fight the hollows for those taken prisoners, not even the Watch. Even if the three were still alive to be saved, the blackcloaks would not sacrifice their own assaulting the cult of the Red Eye in its hidden strongholds – not when they stood to lose so many more souls than they might possibly rescue.

“That is worth getting to the end of these cursed trials, if nothing else,” the Malani quietly said. “I refuse to just stay here and sit as her ashes cool.”

She had never asked, in the end, for him to stay with them tomorrow. It had been her mistake and Cozme’s to believe him the sort of man who would need to be talked into it. She did not flinch away from the shame of that realization, for it was well deserved. They sat together for a while longer, neither feeling the need to speak a word. When an uncharacteristically unsmiling Lieutenant Wen fetched Zenzele an hour later, telling him the body had been cleaned and a pyre raised, she went with him. No one else would.

The pile was outside, drenched with oil, and the body already laid atop it. Angharad stood by his side as he composed himself, struggled to keep his face calm, and finally took the torch the lieutenant was offering.

“It is tradition to speak,” Zenzele rasped, “but I have no words to give, aunt. Even an apology would ring hollow.”

He swallowed.

“Maybe one day I will have earned the right, but not today.”

He raised the torch.

“We who do not stray are eternal,” Zenzele said. “I will see you again, for there are no strangers across the Empty Sea.”

He threw the torch and the fire roared. Those had been Redeemer words, she thought, but not untrue for it. All who did not stray from the Sleeping God would meet again in time, born again and again until all had learned from their mistakes. Angharad watched the flames devouring Inyoni’s corpse, thinking of another fire, and her jaw clenched.  Let eternity wait.

She yet had accounts to settle in this life.

—

They rose early and gathered for the meal, as was becoming habit.

Angharad was surprised to see Isabel had risen before her this time, and more surprised still to see Tristan sitting with her. The grey-eyed man had shown no inclination of joining any crew, not that she would have dared to ask again after bringing back a corpse, but she supposed that did not mean he wanted to be without company. Perhaps if the day went well, Angharad thought, she should spare some time to find out what it was he was up to with the others who remained behind. That aged pair would do so was no great surprise, but Sarai? She was fit enough to delve the maze.

Whatever it was the two were discussing, they settled it before Angharad arrived. Tristan gave her a smile, then rose to his feet.

“I should grab Vanesa’s porridge while it is still warm,” he told her. “Good morn, Lady Angharad, and good luck on your venture.”

He paused, then inclined his head.

“Lady Isabel.”

“Master Tristan,” Isabel amusedly replied.

He took his leave after that under Angharad’s bemused gaze. She sat by Isabel’s side after making certain that others were seated at tables, making the kitchen a public place and allowing her to skirt the edge of her oath to Remund.

“You know,” the dark-haired beauty mused, “I do believe that man might not even have a surname.”

“He seems too well educated for that,” she replied, startled.

Only the poorest of commoners were bereft of last name, at least in Peredur.

“Why else avoid giving it so carefully?” Isabel asked. “No matter, it does not make him any less interesting.”

“He had business with you?” Angharad idly asked.

Isabel smiled at her, the full weight of her attention a little dazzling.

“He was giving me news of Beatris,” she said. “She appears to have had a fit of nerves that left her unfit to try the maze, so I have sent her my permission to withdraw from the trials.”

“That is kind of you,” she replied, pleased at the good treatment.

Kindness to one’s servants was the responsibility of the nobly born. They were joined by the others one after another, the table going silent for a moment after Lord Zenzele came until he gave a toothy grin.

“The funeral was last night,” he said. “Do cheer up.”

No one was so awful as to laugh, but it broke the ice. Quiet conversation resumed and after the meal ended they prepared to set out together. As the previous day, Tupoc’s group had gone ahead. Keeping to their bargain, they moved with Lord Ishaan’s group. The chubby-cheeked Someshwari had picked up a wound across the lips, an oddly fearsome sight on a face that otherwise screamed of harmlessness, and it made it difficult for him to speak. They remained quiet, though neither Song nor Shalini offered them such mercy.

The pair spent half the walk to the shrines arguing about whether Tianxi or Ramayan tea was superior while the other half was reserved to agree that Izcalli xocolatl was ‘too disgusting to inflict on even Someshwari’ and ‘there should be a law against its export, maybe make a mob vote on it’.

“It is good to see Shalini making a friend,” Ishaan happily told her, breaking their silence as they neared the shrines. “Her sense of humor sometimes drives people away.”

“I am surprised to hear it,” Angharad replied, speaking very exactly.

A wry look from the Someshwari told her that perhaps it had not gone unnoticed. They parted ways cordially at the shrines, returning to their previous paths. The dove spirit’s grounds were eerily silent, the holes in the floor still there – though they now looked like simple pits – and the entity itself not deigning to appear. They hurried through, dimly unsettled, and took the same upwards path as before. It was more tiring than dangerous to retrace their steps now that they knew there would be no ambush waiting for them.

When they climbed up from the pools into the tunnel again, ready to shimmy across the edge to the stairs of the temple where Inyoni had died, they did it knowing that a dead thing would attempt to scare them into falling. All ignored it, as for all its loudness it could not hurt them, save for Zenzele – who slapped the remnant spirit on its head with a laugh, though it did not cease shrieking. Not enough thought remained inside, she suspected.

The gesture was to be an augury of continued recklessness, Angharad realized when he did not wait for everyone to be ready before climbing the steps to the clockwork temple. Cursing under her breath she hurried, finding him standing along among the great room with the polished floor and the ticking machines.

“Not a trace of anything broken,” he said when she caught up. “Like we were never here at all.”

The spirit of brass and cogs did not show, this time, perhaps uninterested now that it had fed and they could not be pressed into another of its tests.

“You are a victor still,” Angharad said. “That remains.”

“It was a victor as well,” Zenzele mildly replied. “That is the part I find difficult to forgive.”

They had not ventured beyond the clockwork temple yesterday, so it was fresh grounds they broke as the crossed the machine-strewn chamber. There was a hall leading out, a thing of moonstone and serpentine as the one that had led them in, but here the streaks of iron and gold painting the walls were not so wild. There were clear patterns, beginning circular and becoming increasingly angular as the hall continued. It made Angharad’s eyes tear up to look at them too long so she yanked her gaze away. That the spirit had not appeared did not mean its hand could not be felt.

At the end of the hall half-shattered stairs led down to what she thought to be walls at first but soon realized were the sloping seats of an arena. It was why her boots creaked against sand as she took the lead and why the structure was so curved – though she could not see the whole of it, as it continued around the side of the clockwork temple and mixed into masses of rubbles with jutting columns. The grounds were ruins, not a shrine, and as they walked on the sand they found that there were three ways out of the arena.

The first was in a straight line, through the front gates, and appeared to be a tangle of stairs going both up and down. Another was through a rusted grate, going down into the ground in a spiral, and the last began atop the highest seats to their right: some sort of bridge leading into a structure that seemed to be a broad tower.

“That tower has shrine written all over it,” Lord Remund opined.

“Agreed,” Song said. “The stairs perhaps?”

“I do not like the look of that grate,” Angharad admitted. “Let us try the stairs.”

There were no strong opinions against it, so to the stairs they went. It was worse than she had thought at first glance: the stairs led up and down, left and right, and crisscrossed each other as if painted by a madman. Going up  a few flights let her catch sight of a structure at the end of the mess, what looked like a highway with raised steles wedged in between two large walls, but the stairs themselves were a death trap. They were falling apart, sometimes on each other, and after Zenzele kicked a loose stone on a whim an entire section collapsed. The Malani apologized, but the words were a little too blithe for her taste.

Angharad stared him down until he looked away, conceding with a jerky nod. He was allowed his grief but not to risk their lives with it.

Yet disinclined to the high bridge and tower, they headed for the rusted grate. Yaretzi and Master Cozme kicked it off the hinges and then went down the narrow tunnel. It spun in a spiral, uncomfortably narrow, and dug into the stone beneath. There were no steps, only a slope, and they had to be careful not to slip. After what had to be at least ten minutes of heading down they emerged into a dark crypt. Rectangular tombs of bare stone lay open, lantern light revealing they were filled only with dust, and at the other end of the chamber the wall was made from a darker kind of stone. They crossed, wary of an attack that never came, and then stepped into a hall that ended after three feet in a strange circular chamber lit by some kind of hanging lantern.

There were four gates inside the room, but all were closed and barred.

Angharad saw no lock or knocker, nor any other way to open them, so her gaze strayed to the strange contraption that filled almost the entire room. It looked like a wheel, she thought, though one without a rim. Four spokes of solid brass jutted out, each going from slightly above her midsection to the floor, while the hub they jutted from was tall as a man and broad as three – and not small men, either. The mechanism’s floor was dull brass, rough and unpolished, but unlike the hallway bore no dust.

“It does not look like a shrine,” Song noted. “There are no marks and symbols, only bare stone and brass.”

“Perhaps we are meant to push the spokes of the wheel,” Remund Cerdan suggested. “To raise the gates like a portcullis.”

“Could be,” Angharad mused. “Though that would be a great weight and we might not be enough.”

“No, we will be.”

She glanced back, seeing Yaretzi bush past Isabel with a grim look on her face.

“I have seen this before,” the Izcalli said. “Some of my people’s candles are locked the same way.”

“You know how to open it?” Angharad asked.

“If I am right,” Yaretzi agreed.

The dark-haired woman made her way to the edge of the hall, kneeling by the threshold to the wheelroom to rap a knuckle against the brass floor. The sound, to Angharad’s surprise, was hollow. As if there were nothing under a small layer of brass. Yaretzi repeated the same gesture until her hand was near the center of the space between the two spokes, where at last the sound turned solid.

“As I thought,” the Izcalli said, rising to her feet. “It is weight-locked. Enough of us will need to stand on the platform to lower the hidden part and trigger the mechanism.”

“And then what?” Master Cozme asked.

There Yaretzi grimaced.

“I am uncertain,” she admitted. “I have never seen one with more than a single gate. It should open the doors, but beyond that I cannot say.”

“Sounds fun,” Lord Zenzele carelessly said. “Let’s give it a whirl.”

Angharad glance at him warningly but did not speak otherwise. For all that the Malani was being reckless the plain truth was that activating the device was the only way through this room.

“There might be some danger falling upon us before the doors open,” Isabel said. “It would be best for us to split with such an eventuality in mind.”

The Pereduri noblewoman thought that sensible enough. They separated accordingly: Isabel with her, Cozme with Remund, and after Zenzele insisted on standing alone Song and Yaretzi. When Isabel joined her at the center of the space some mechanical part clicked beneath their feet, the floor descending by the barest of fractions, and then they watched as the others spread around the wheel by climbing over spokes. The very moment Zenzele took his place, a last click resounded across the small room and they all felt something shifting beneath their feet.

A long moment passed.

“Perhaps we are to push after all,” Lord Remund drawled.

He went to place his hand against the spoke before him, but before he could there was a sudden shiver beneath their feet. Angharad glimpsed ahead and-

“Brace yourselves,” she shouted.

Half of them were still knocked down when the wheel abruptly began spinning. She caught Isabel by the waist, bringing her close and trying not to wonder at how even in this nightmare of an island the infanzona’s hair still smelled of lavender, then held them both in place by snatching at the top of the spoke with her other hand. Cozme cursed virulently as he smacked into the brass and Zenzele let out a whooping laugh as he held on for dear life. All the lanterns save Yaretzi’s went flying, smashing against stone or brass.

And the wheel kept spinning, faster and faster.

Isabel would have slipped her gasp had the dark-haired beauty not begun clinging to the spoke on her own, the two of them struggling to keep upright as the air howled against their faces and the sole burning light above whipped them with shadows.

“The gate,” Song shouted. “The gate is opening.”

Angharad risked a glance and saw that the Tianxi was right: one of the gates was slowly rising, as if being dragged up an inch at a time. Were they meant to jump out when it opened up enough? It would be difficult, she thought, but hardly impossible. They held one for another ten breaths, the gate opening up just enough for a man to be able to get through on their knees, and Angharad pushed herself up. Hopefully the others would not argue the need to jump, for speaking would be difficult.

“We-”

Before she could finish the sentence, she turned weightless. Or so it felt for the barest fraction of a moment, before she realized that the wheel had just abruptly changed directions. Shouting as she was thrown back against a curtain of brass – ancestors, that was going to bruise – and Isabel’s back smacked her in the face a heartbeat later, she heard other shouts.

Two of which abruptly cut off.

No, she thought, rising to her feet as she pushed off the infanzona. It was as she feared: Song and Yaretzi were missing while the once-open gate had slammed shut. It is no gate mechanism, she thought, it is a trap. One meant to separate us.  

“Seek each other out on the other side,” Angharad shouted. “We must not remain-”

Unlike the last, the gate that opened this time did so in a heartbeat and Zenzele threw himself in the opening with a wild laugh before wheel even changed directions to force his hand. They were all better prepared for the turnabout this time, all staying on their feet save Remund – who Cozme caught by the arm and held in place. The third gate opened, the pair tossed through it, and for the first time Angharad got a glimpse of what lay past it. Some kind of stony slope. They both went tumbling down.

Now there were only the two of them left.

“Ready yourself,” she told Isabel. “Better to jump than be thrown.”

She had not closely looked at the infanzona before but now that she did, she saw the terror writ there. Isabel’s fair face had gone pale, her eyes wild and she was worrying her lip so hard it looked fit to bleed.

“Please,” Isabel said. “Together. I do not know if-”

How striking her teary gaze was Angharad thought, a little dazed. She tended to prefer women of harder character, but perhaps on occasion being needed would not be so – no, not the time.

“Together,” she agreed.

They barely had three heartbeats to ready themselves before the fourth gate began to open. The timing seemed to be shorter every time, as if the machine fed on its own momentum. Angharad glimpsed ahead twice to gauge the timing, a trick she was becoming increasingly fond of, and almost winced when she saw herself hit the bottom of the gate with her front teeth on the first attempt. It was a good thing she did not feel what she saw, as she could do without intimate knowledge of what it felt like to shatter half her mouth.

When they leapt, Isabel trembling in her arms, it was straight into the dark.

Blinded by the sudden change in lighting Angharad blinked even as the ground gave beneath her feet – it was a slope, like she had seen in the others – but after two steps her boots slid against wetness and Isabel screamed in fear. They tumbled forward, Angharad’s belly flopping on shallow water while her chin raked against the stone below it, and she felt Isabel’s fingers slide through hers.

“No,” the infanzona shouted. “Angharad, you-”

She was interrupted by a loud thump, smacking into something. For a heartbeat Angharad believed her dead, the thought like a burn, but then she heard Isabel shouting as she bounced off into water. Distant water, as if they were being separated. Without a lantern to see Angharad was blind, but even as she fell her fingers groped ahead and she found rising stone – there had been a fork just beyond the gate, she realized, and they were falling down different sides of it. Heart pounding with fear for the infanzona, she tried to hurry her way down. The water was shallow but it helped her slide faster, her clothes drenched and hair turning slick.

She went down a canal for what felt like an eternity until she fell into a pool.

It was deep enough she had to swim up and when she broke the surface she saw there was finally light again, coming from glass orbs hung on the ceiling. Making for the shore, she got out onto a stone floor before taking a better look around. This looked to be a cavern, though one with two large pools – both being fed by small canals, one of which she had come through. There were half a dozen openings in the wall ahead, none of them looking carved and all rather narrow. Angharad waited a little longer to see if Isabel was to come down the other canal, but after a few minutes of dripping onto the floor to no sign of the infanzona she reluctantly got moving.

A few glimpses told her there were no traps no matter the opening, so she took the rightmost and headed in.

The lights were dimmer in here, small glass orbs burning dirty yellow, but she could still see just fine. Twice she faced forks and took a right, the second time leading her to a precipice. The tunnel ended abruptly in a deep black abyss facing wall of rock, faint wind like a breath rising from below. She shuddered, about ready to double back when she saw a flicker of movement ahead. She had not noticed, but on the other side of the precipice there was an opening in the rock with light flickering – almost like an eye. She saw a pool through it, and another precipice someone was standing by. Their hair was long and dark.

“Isabel,” she shouted, and it echoed endlessly in the abyss.

The silhouette across did not react, hesitating a little longer before moving out of sight. There was no telling if it was truly the infanzona, Angharad reminded herself. Where spirits held dominion the wise did not trust their eyes.

She returned to the tunnels, intent on pushing forward since it was unlikely there was a way across the abyss. Everywhere seemed the same, bare stone coated in flickering light, and after a while it felt as if she had no idea where she’d come from. Angharad began scratching the walls with her sword under the orbs, but she had begun too late and it only prevented her from going in circles. After long enough that her clothes had gone from wet to damp, the Pereduri finally stumbled onto the end of the tunnels. It was a striking enough sight it gave her pause, impatient as she was.

It was as if someone had raised a hall entirely out of cloudy, silvery crystals.

They shone with light from somewhere unseen, each perfectly smooth surface reflecting itself as a house of mirrors. It was strikingly beautiful, Angharad thought, enough that she was distracted from immediately noticing the entrances. There were three of them, going into a hall that must be sprawling for she saw no end to it, but one was closed by a solid slab of crystal. She approached for a closer look, eyes widening when she saw that someone had darkened the threshold of the entrance around the slab with what must have been an open flame. Two letters: S and Y.  Yaretzi, she recalled, had kept her lantern from breaking when the spin changed directions.

Angharad breathed in deeply, comforted at the thought that at least two of her comrades had made it this far. That it might be only two was an upsetting prospect, but there might well be other entrances to this place. There had been four doors, after all. At the very least there could be no doubt that this hall must be her path, or as to what its true nature was despite its beauty. Angharad straightened her back, then offered a low bow.

“I implore the attention of the honored elder who dwells in this temple,” she said.

The air shivered, but this was subtler a spirit than the kind she had encountered in the maze until now. There was no great manifestation, no eye-catching totem to command attention. Only traces of silver light facing her in the slab of crystal, suggesting the shape of a face.

“Robber. Or. Supplicant.”

Angharad hid her pained wince by lowering her head. It was as if the words were made of the sound of crystal cracking, just a little too high and sharp to be anything but daggers to the ear.

“I would be a supplicant to your temple, honored elder,” Angharad said. “If you would tell me of the terms of your test and the wager therein.”

“Wager. Lantern.”

Not unexpected. She waited for the terms.

“Win. By. Reaching. End. Hall.”

A pause.

“Or. Take. A. Life.”

Painful as it was to the ear, she sought clarifications. The prize would be crossing the temple unhindered for she and any companion. To die within the hall, however, was to surrender your soul to the spirit. It remained vague about whose life might be taken within its test, however, simply calling them ‘opponents’. She had her suspicions, especially when it was made plain that to take another’s life would see you led to the end of the hall safely. It means to keep us in its hall of mirrors until we grow desperate enough to kill our own, Angharad thought. The Watch had implied nothing lived out here save for ravenous spirits, so the only lives for them to take were each other’s.

She had no intention of slaying her companions or allowing them to be slain, but that still meant taking the test.

“I accept your test and terms, honored elder, and would undertake supplication,” Angharad said.

“Good. Luck.”

To ascribe emotion to the spirit would be as trying to read the intonation of a razor blade, but as it spoke Angharad somehow felt as if she was being mocked. And though it was but a glimmer of cold light, she could not shake the impression that she had looked at something living – convulsing, red and wet, like a throat swallowing. A second look told her it was but tiredness working away at her mind, the spirit unchanged. Hiding her unease, the Pereduri headed for the entrance to her right and settled her breathing. Hand on her saber, she took a firm step past the threshold and into the shining hall.

A heartbeat after, a slab of crystal hammered down and closed the entrance.

There would be no going back.

# Chapter 26

It was as an endless gallery.

The crystal walls fed into each other, promising infinity in a thimble as the mirroring went on and on. The heights were not all the same, the angles askew and there were even slight slopes to the ground to further muddle the senses. Th effect was strong: Angharad had barely taken ten steps before she became uncertain which way she had entered. A pale and silvery glow hung in the air, lighting the way, but there was no visible source for it. Boots whispering across the smooth floor, she boldly stepped forward – after learning that her sword could not cut into the crystal, anyhow. There would be no marking of her path, the opaque rock surprisingly hard for something that looked so delicate.

The first attack came from behind just as she turned a corner.

Her saber came up to parry the blow, but she was hacking into air. The figure on the mirror, which she now saw was her own face distended into something other, smirked before walking out of sight. Sleeping God, Angharad thought. It was going to be even worse than she had thought if the spirit could paint illusions on the mirrors. This place might well become a tomb if she could not even trust her eyes. Her hackles stayed up as she pressed on, thrice more ambushed by nothing. Yet she could not lower her guard, begin to ignore the attacks. It was what the spirit wanted, for her to stop guarding before a real blade came for her neck.

The Pereduri kept to the right as much as she could, occasionally forced to detour, but after how long only the spirit knew – less than an hour, surely? – she began encountering dead ends. After the third in a row she stopped, biting her lip as she met the eyes of her horrid reflection on the wall. Should she leave the edge of the labyrinth? She had thought it sensible to try to keep to the border in the hopes of circling until she found an exit, but now she was beginning to fear she would reach a wall and be forced to backtrack blindly.

“No,” she murmured. “Carry it out to the end, you fool. Half measures are coffin nails.”

She must keep to the plan until she knew for sure it was all dead ends. Walking away from the dead end, she returned to the broader corridor behind it and caught sight of a flicker of movement – another mirror ambush, she thought, but raised her blade anyway.

Steel ground against steel, a clumsily wielded knife slamming down onto her saber’s guard.

Sheer surprise quickening her hand, Angharad pushed back her opponent – a shrieking monster, hideous and twisted – and drew back three steps. She ignored the hundred reflections blooming over every wall, floor and ceiling to keep her eye entirely on the enemy. It looked like no lemure the Pereduri had ever seen, nor cultist: its skin was rotten and its teeth as yellow coral. It wore rags that clinked, as if laden with hidden coins, and held the knife in a guard that Angharad did not recognize. Some ancient art of war, perhaps?

“We need not fight,” Angharad clearly enunciated.

The monster shrieked back and the noblewoman frowned. It seemed intelligent. Perhaps a corpse taken over by a puppeteer lemure? It was when the creature attacked that it came together. It struck by flailing blindly with no stance, care or even understanding that her reach was much longer than its own. That was no strange guard, it simply does not know how to use a knife. And that told her the hidden truth behind the monstrosity. Angharad stepped into the other’s guard, slapping the blow aside with her elbow and smoothly sliding her arm around their neck. They struggled desperately but they were weaker than her, so she squeezed and lowered them to the ground as she kept the knife flailing aimlessly at their back.

After a minute or so the illusion broke, revealing the weeping face of the woman called Aines.

“-please, I don’t-” she was saying, the shrieking turning into Antigua.

Admittedly sometimes the difference between the two was academic. Aines, looking wan and with a purpling black eye on her face, went still in her arms.

“Lady Tredegar?” she croaked.

Angharad released her.

“The maze veils our faces to make us slay each other,” she said, extricating herself and rising to her feet. “This spirit would feed on our bones.”

“I,” the woman began, then bit her lip. “Yes, my lady. May I… may I come with you?”

“You must,” Angharad agreed. “Are all of your companions also in the maze?”

She nodded.

“It was the only way forward for us,” Aines said. “Though the god made us wait before letting us in.”

And so the spirit’s scheme was laid out plainly. It wanted Tupoc’s crew and her own to butcher each other under veil of illusion. I might have seen through the trick were I facing Song or Cozme, for I know the look of their height and weapons, but I know little of those who went with Tupoc. The spirit had waited until her own companions were at the gates of its hall to let in the other group for that very reason, she was sure of it.

“We must find the others quickly,” Angharad grimly said. “Else there will be blood.”

Tupoc Xical was not the sort of man to think twice at slaying any who stood in his way. Aines freely admitted to having been lost – she had brought chalk and tried to mark the walls but it did not seem to take – so they continued her approach. As if irked by being denied a corpse, the spirit set another in their path within minutes. An ogre dripping red pus roared at the other end of the hall, reflections just as fearsome flickering every which way, and it raised its hammer. This one Angharad recognized.

“Ocotlan,” she stated.

Whatever the man heard through the veil of illusion, it was not his name. He roared again and charged. Behind her Aines whimpered, taking steps back, but Angharad breathed out and loosened her stance. The big man was strong and startlingly quick, she knew that from her never-fights with him in her visions, but he fought without polish. At a guess, he had never been formally trained.

Angharad had been and would teach him the difference.

Thirteen paces away she tapped her blade against her left shoulder in a duelist’s salute, gauging the distances carefully. Eight paces. Angharad darted forward a step, startling Ocotlan into swinging early at her, but she had stopped a single step in. The hammer swung before her and once it passed she stepped into his open guard. He was a big man and rushing forward like a bull, but the hammer was heavy and had been strongly swung so his stance was off – training, training, those bad habits were removed only through training. A pivot around his attempt at tackling her, then a boot to the back of the knee.

The big man went down, his weight smashing into the crystal floor.

Angharad leisurely turned around as he rose into a crouch, flicking a lazy cut his way that had him flinching away and swinging blindly at her. She stepped back at that, as if afraid of the blow, and he took that opening to rise back to his feet just as she’d wanted – only for her to dart forward and kick him in the buttocks, back down with his belly flat on the floor. Further back, Aines let out a sound halfway between a giggle and a hysterical fit. Ocotlan, still looking like some deformed creature, flipped onto his back only to find the point of her saber at his throat.

“Stay down,” Angharad mildly said. “The illusion will dispel.”

Whatever it was he heard it made him flinch, but he was more afraid of the blade a single hair’s breadth away from piercing his throat: Ocotlan did not move. Twenty seconds later the Aztlan’s broad face replaced the ogre’s, sudden understanding lighting up those dark eyes.

“Tredegar,” Ocotlan grunted. “I should have known, who else-”

She pressed the tip of the sword against her throat and he fell silent. No mercy for this one, who had been Tupoc Xical’s right hand since they first made common cause on the Bluebell.

“You will follow me,” Angharad said. “You will obey my orders. You will not, under any circumstances, kill inside this labyrinth.”

The big man snarled.

“If you think-”

This time the point drew a drop of blood. She met his eyes, letting every inch of her indifference to his continued existence show in her gaze.

“You seem under the misapprehension that this is a negotiation,” Angharad mildly said. “It would be best to correct that mistake.”

The tattooed man then decided he was willing to take her orders, after all.

Fancy that.

—

Their next encounter was not a fight.

“Angharad!”

Isabel was in her arms a heartbeat later, wrapped closed and tight. Over the infanzona’s shoulder she saw Song rolling her eyes at them. She smiled at the Tianxi, seeing she was unharmed, and it was returned. She drew back from Isabel to examine her for wounds, finding that she had been struck. Her lip was bloodied and a little swollen, like someone had punched her in the face.

“Are you all right?” she worriedly asked. “You were attacked?”

“Mistress Song struck me before the illusion was broken,” Isabel told her. “Naught but a trifle.”

Angharad’s eyes flicked to the other woman, whose empty expression must be hiding embarrassment. It must be a powerful illusion the spirit had woven to fool even her silver eyes.

“We getting a move on?” Ocotlan grunted. “This is sickening.”

Sometimes, Mother had taught her, a crew gets a man that is simply a bad seed. If you cannot get rid of them, there is only one thing for it.

“Ocotlan,” Angharad very mildly said, “it sounds as if you are trying to tell me what to do.”

She half turned, Isabel still loosely in her grasp, and met the big man’s eyes.

“Surely you would know better than to do such a thing.”

There was a long moment, then the tattooed Aztlan looked away.

“I was just saying,” he muttered. “Meant nothing by it.”

Step on them, Mother had said. Hard and often, so that the seed will never sprout into a weed. When she turned back, Angharad found Isabel looking at her with wide eyes and the slightest of flushes to her neck. She swallowed, meeting the infanzona’s green gaze, and would have lost herself in it if not for the inconvenient awareness that they were far from alone. Clearing her throat, the Pereduri released the other woman and straightened her coat.

“Let us go forward,” Angharad said. “The others might be in danger.”

They did, and immediately it made a stark difference to have Song with her again.

“Yaretzi and I were split when a slab fell between us,” the Tianxi told her. “I came across Ruesta after and mapped out what I could – I believe the hall is broadly a square and we have gone around the entire right half of the labyrinth. It would mean we are now following the edge of the left half.”

“Then it is only a matter of time until we find the end,” Angharad mused. “It must be at some extremity.”

“Yes,” Song murmured, “and that worries me.”

The Pereduri almost asked why, until she thought twice of it.

“You believe we were guided towards each other on purpose,” she said.

The other woman nodded.

“You have proved able to subdue others without shedding blood,” she said. “And as for me…”

She discreetly tapped her left temple, meaning the eyes. Yes, Song’s ability to see through some of the trickery would be most unwelcome. The Tianxi’s speculation that they were being guided towards the way out of the maze so they could not help anyone else seemed entirely believable.

“Then we must keep a careful eye out for any attempt to herd us away from a passage,” Angharad murmured. “There may well be others behind such a thing.”

Another tense few minutes treading mirroring halls followed, their fears proving more and more true: now the fake reflections were not only attacks but also feigned to be walls or dead ends. The spirit was trying to keep them on a path and would have entirely succeeded if not for Song’s quiet directions. It came to an apex after Angharad turned a corner only for the Tianxi to go still, then raising the butt of her musket and smashing at a wall. There was a crack, to their common surprise, and three strong hits later a small sheet of crystal that had seemed a wall fell to pieces.

“New walls are growing,” Song flatly told them. “I am beginning to suspect that this place is no shrine: it is the god’s own body.”

A disquieting thought for all, but when Angharad announced that the hallway the spirit wanted them to avoid must surely be explored none argued. Their curiosity led them to three turns nearer to the heart of the mirrored hall, where horrid noises echoed. The noblewoman hurried ahead, blade out, and found two false monsters savaging each other. One seemed a lupine horror of scarred flesh and smoke, the other an automaton of rusted bronze dripping green oil – the smoking thing was hitting the other in the stomach, its knife on the floor.

“Stop,” Angharad shouted.

Neither turned or seemed to hear her. An illusion of nothing at all, she thought. Four more steps and the bronze creature traced a circle of burning light on the other’s skin, drawing a bloodcurdling scream out of it, and staggered a step back before raising its blade. She shouted again but went unheard, the monster that could only be Remund striking – only for the blade to be shot in the side as Song’s musket thundered. It shattered.

Not before an inch of it went into the other man’s belly.

The veiled Remund let out a sound like metal being ground, turning towards them in what she knew was fear even through the illusion. The other man staggered back clutching at his wound, and this was no time for carefulness. Angharad barreled between them, pushing the wounded down and slapping away the knife Remund tried to sink into her side. She struck him the belly, as she had done his brother, and as he folded shouted for someone to help the hurt man. Remund, still letting out that infernal noise, feinted low. She let it whisper near her leg, then harshly slammed the top of her head into his nose.

She felt something break.

They backed away from each other after that, the veiled Remund clutching at a nose she could only assume was bleeding, and Angharad slowly moved her saber to be pointing his way. The man paused. Just as slowly she placed the saber on the ground even as she heard Aines and Isabel helping move the wounded man behind her. Remund exaggeratedly put away his knife and she let out a sigh of relief, finally allowing her fingers to loosen.

A heartbeat later both illusions broke, leaving her to look at Remund Cerdan clutching a nosebleed with eyes still wild and wide.

“Fuck,” he said, finding her face. “I should have known from the saber it was you, fucking fucker gods.”

The cursing was particularly virulent by the end of the sentence.

“I wish I could have done it without hurting you,” Angharad said, which as close to an apology as she would give.

A moment later Isabel was brushing past her – sparing a smile as she did – and making a fuss over a pleased and surprised Remund. She took the opportunity to look back, finding that the wounded man was Aines’ own husband. Felis, for that was his name, looked badly off. Not only did he have old cuts from yesterday but he was still bruised from Zenzele’s rage and now he had a gut wound. Relatively shallow, to Angharad’s eye, but gut wounds were always a nasty business.

“No,” Aines was insisting. “We must leave the blade in or the wound will bleed you out. We’ll get you back to the fort, then the doctor-”

“I don’t know if I can walk that far,” Felis moaned. “Not like this. Is Lan-”

“Not here,” Aines sharply said, the worry in her voice thinning. “Come on, up on your feet.”

Angharad looked away, finding Song coming to stand by her side. They shared a grimace.

“We must get him out of here as quickly as possible,” the Tianxi said. “That wound may kill him otherwise.”

She had known that without needing to be told, but it went against her instincts to leave when she would be abandoning others. Tupoc was out there, ready to kill if he had not already, while Yaretzi, Master Cozme and Zenzele were yet to be found. Of Tupoc’s crew the surviving twin, Lan, would still be out there as well.

And Augusto, thoughthatone dyingwould hardly be a loss.

The Pereduri closed her eyes, trying to find a way through. She could think of none that did not involve reaching safety and then doubling back through the labyrinth to the Old Fort so that the Watch physician might see to Felis’ wound. If Tristan were with them it might be different, but… I must speak with him again, Angharad thought. Surely he has had long enough to rest by now. The dilemma ate away at her. Condemn Felis to death or abandon some of her comrades to the possibility of that very same fate? Angharad shivered, a coolness calm and patient spreading through her veins.

The Fisher was watching. Waiting. Where would honor lie?

“We must go soon,” Song murmured. “Felis will only get worse and it is a long way back to the Old Fort, especially if Aines is the only one going back with him.”

Angharad had not even considered that Ocotlan might abandon his comrades, though perhaps she should have. There seemed to be little enough affection between them. Would the spirit even consider them companions under the writ of the bargain? Their like always tried to- Angharad stilled. There it was, her third path.

The Pereduri opened her eyes as the Fisher’s presence withdrew. Disappointed.

“We head for the end of the labyrinth,” she said. “As fast as we can.”

Song’s silver eyes considered her a moment.

“As you say.”

—

It was not even ten minutes before they reach the end of the crystal hall.

The spirit wanted them out: by the last stretch there had been no false reflections trying to lead them astray, as if the entity was encouraging them to leave. The wounded Felis trailed behind, helped to move by his wife and Isabel’s kindness, but not so far as to ever be out of sight. The final part of the mirrored hall was a straight line leading to a glittering arch, a glimpse of a strange cavern lying beyond. Angharad put a spring to her step, ensuring she was the first to leave the labyrinth, and gestured for the others to stay behind after she did.

Traces of silver light shone on the arch, the spirit revealing its presence.

“Honored elder,” Angharad said, “I have reached the end of your hall.”

“Victor,” the spirit said. “Leave. Unhindered. With. Companions.”

Then she gestured for the others to come out, which they hesitantly did. The silvery glints faded but Angharad cleared her throat.

“You are going back on your bargain,” she said.

The lights returned, flaring bright.

“Lie.”

“You are hindering my companions as we speak,” Angharad evenly said. “Those yet within the hall.”

“LIE. NOT. COMPANIONS.”

The sound was like crystal being smashed, ice cracking under your feet.

“If I claim them such, who are you to gainsay me?” she said. “I give you their names: Cozme Aflor, Zenzele Duma, Tupoc Xical-”

“LIE. LIE. LIE.”

“-Yaretzi of Izcalli, Lan of Sacromonte and…”

She paused. Tupoc Xical was as far as she was willing to stretch the boundary of truth, mostly so he could not stay in the hall and kill others. Augusto Cerdan she would not claim as a companion even by the loosest of definitions.

“… and that is all,” Angharad finished. “I expect them led out of the hall without trouble.”

“YOU WILL NOT DENY ME,” the spirit hissed.

The lights disappeared and silence followed. The world breathed in, stillness hanging by a thread, and then there was a thundering crack.

In the distance, a span of the crystal hall’s ceiling collapsed.

It was the first stone of an avalanche. The labyrinth began falling apart as if someone had ripped out its seams, walls tipping over or bursting into pieces. It did not turn to rubble, it was not so widespread as that, but what had been a neat hall turned into a yawning ruin over what could not have been more than thirty seconds. Angharad felt gazes burn into her back as one last bit of ceiling plummeted down.

“Lady Angharad,” Remund delicately said, “did you just anger a god so deeply it broke its own shrine out of spite?”

More than that, if Song’s assertion about the crystal hall had been true.

“It appears the hall is no longer breaking,” Angharad said, strategically ignoring the infanzon’s words. “Are there volunteers to look for survivors with me?”

Isabel quickly agreed, predictably joined by an irritated Remund. Song stayed behind to keep an eye on the others. The three of them went into the ruins, scaling rough-edged crystal to wade through the destruction. It was dangerous and exhausting work, for now sharp pieces littered everywhere, but it must be done. For all that their help proved largely unnecessary: Master Cozme found them before they him, having bruised from a falling chunk of crystal but otherwise fine. Next came Zenzele and Lan, the latter having been cut shallowly across the arms by a blade.

“The illusion did not cover blood,” Zenzele told them. “I saw it must be a person and not some monster.”

“And a good thing he did, if I had kept running I would have been under that,” Lan tacked on.

She pointed a length of ceiling twenty feet long and three feet thick. Death would have been instant. Isabel escorted them back through the ruins, leaving Angharad with Remund. The youngest of the Cerdan brothers had been quiet since Isabel’s departure, but he eventually gathered his courage and spoke.

“Should we find Augusto,” Remund said, “something will need to be done. Preferably without others around to interfere.”

Angharad studied him for a moment, then nodded.

“I never finished my duel with him,” she said. “Honor can be made to wait, but never abandoned.”

“Then we have an understanding,” the infanzon smiled.

Only it was not Augusto they found but the other two. Tupoc and Yaretzi were both wounded, but he the heavier of the two. She had a shallow wound on the upper arm, but he had a very thin cut across the cheek and a slab of crystal seemed to have fallen on his foot. Both had weapons in hand, he his segmented spear and Yaretzi a long knife.

“The test is at an end,” Angharad called out. “Lay down your arms.”

Tupoc smiled, but not at them.

“You first, Turquoise,” he said, drawing out the word mockingly.

“Now,” Angharad insisted.

“Or don’t,” Remund casually said. “I rather like our odds.”

Even in the face of their threats Tupoc did not waver. It was Yaretzi who lowered her long knife.

“Peace,” she said. “There is no need for violence.”

“You have,” Tupoc mused, “the most delightful sense of humor.”

“Enough,” Angharad said. “Let us leave this place, there may yet be peril.”

Tupoc put down his spear.

“Have my boon companions all survived, then?” he asked.

“There is one yet missing,” Angharad blandly replied.

“I wonder who it might be, for you to have such an expression on your face,” Tupoc drily said.

He rubbed his chin.

“Still, best to tend to my surviving flock for now,” he said. “I shall leave you to it, Tredegar. For a time.”

He strolled away, only slightly limping despite what must be cracked if not outright broken toes, and left them standing in the ruins. Angharad would have admired the gall, were he not so vile a man. Yaretzi thanked them for the help but had no intention of staying to look for Augusto. She waited until Tupoc was ahead enough she would not have to walk with him and left. The Pereduri continued to comb through the ruins with Remund, but after ten minutes she was forced to admit that there was no sign of Augusto Cerdan.

“He might have died in the collapse,” she finally said.

Remund shook his head.

“Cerdan do not die easy,” the infanzon said. “I will believe him dead when I see a corpse, not a moment before.”

Whether that was sentiment or fear she knew not, but either way she cared not to argue against it. Despite their efforts they could not seem to get close to where she had entered, anyhow, for the way the hall had collapsed had closed off entire sections in practice if not in the absolute sense – it might be possible to topple great crystals or clear sharp fields, given enough time and labor, but both were in sharp supply.

“I cannot see a way back,” she admitted.

“We could scale some of the crystals using my contract,” Remund mused. “But not all the way, it would take too many rings and for too long.”

The only way was forward, then. They could have looked further, but aware there was only so much time to waste here in the ruins Angharad gave in to the practicalities of their situation and they headed back to the others. There she found the crews had split again, Tupoc smiling widely.

“Lady Angharad, we were just speaking of you,” he said. “Have you found path backwards through the hall?”

“There is none,” she said. “Perhaps given time and effort we might be able to make one, but even then for some of us that passage would be… unfeasible.”

She did not need to glance at Felis for him to hear what she was saying.

“We will have to go around, then,” Tupoc casually said. “As I am told you set out to safeguard our lives through bargain with the god, I would return the courtesy. Shall our crews make common cause, at least until a path back to the Old Fort is found?”

It was her instinct to deny him, to insist on their crews going separate ways, but she tempered the urge to answer in haste. The cavern spread out before them was poorly lit, what little light there was coming from pits where translucent blue crystals glowed, but from what Angharad could see there was only one way out. Regardless of her desires she might well be forced to share a road with Tupoc’s crew, so it would be best to settle the relationship between them first.

“I would agree to a truce until we find a path back to the Old Fort,” Angharad said. “Extended to all now present.”

Tupoc glanced at his followers, their exhausted mien and eagerness to avoid confrontation, and snorted.

“Alas, poor Augusto,” he said. “I accept your terms, Lady Tredegar.”

They lingered a little longer in the cavern, preparing to leave, until Felis snapped at his wife. Many looked away in discomfort, Angharad catching only that the man believed his latest wound to be shallow and insisted he would be fine. She was joined by Zenzele, who discreetly drew her attention to a quiet conversation between Tupoc and Ocotlan.

“Are you any good with a musket, my lady?” he asked.

“Passable at best,” she admitted.

She was not untutored, that would have been a grave lack in a noble, but had never taken to it the way she had the sword.

“Shame,” Zenzele mused. “Someone really ought to put a shot in that man’s skull.”

“We are under truce,” Angharad flatly reminded him. “By my own word.”

“We are,” the Malani agreed. “Until we aren’t. The weeds that we do not pull up in this trial may well come to haunt us in the next, Lady Angharad. It might be best to act rather than be acted upon.”

She met his eyes squarely.

“If such a thing is to be done,” the Pereduri said, “it will be after the truce is finished. I will brook no chicanery in this.”

Zenzele Duma hummed, then looked away.

“We still have time,” he said. “For now. Keep it in mind, that is all I ask.”

It was arguable whether to plan on an attack immediately following the end of the truce, as Zenzele had been implying should be done, would be a breach of honor. It was a fine line, for in some sense to plot was to act, but it would not be going against the words exact. Yet these were a hiltless sword and not one she wanted to grow used to wielding. If there was to be war upon Tupoc Xical, she thought, let it be done the right way. Not cloak and dagger business, barely keeping to the finest lines of honor. Unsettled, she sought out Song so the two of them might take the vanguard.

She found the Tianxi leaning near the opening in the cavern wall, cloak pulled tight around her as she kept an eye on Felis and Aines. The married pair had, at least, ceased arguing.

“What is it you look for?” Angharad asked.

“Trouble,” Song replied. “But it is too late to avoid, I think.”

“It has been a long day already,” she tiredly agreed.

“We may have to pass the night out here, if we do not find a good path,” the Tianxi told her. “It would be wiser than to force a trip back when we are all tired and making mistakes.”

“I would avoid sleeping out here if we can,” she muttered. “There was something about that spirit, Song, that unsettles me still.”

“So you noticed as well,” the other woman approvingly said.

“There was something wrong with it,” Angharad said. “You said the hall might be its own body, I recall. Why would it wound itself so, however much I angered it?”

The Tianxi’s face was grim.

“I begin to wonder if it was not a body instead,” she replied.

Did she perhaps mean a corpse?

“A dead spirit, like the screeching thing we encountered?” the noblewoman skeptically asked. “It seemed too cogent for that.”

“The Watch told us that the gods in the maze eat each other,” Song said. “What if it not so simple as devouring, though? What if instead of consuming the vanquished, the victor… hollowed them out, so to speak.”

“A puppet,” Angharad slowly said. “You mean to say that this was a dead god’s shell with another playacting through it.”

“That would make it well worth to collapse the hall for a chance at of one of us dying,” Song said.

“But why feign to be another?” she asked. “I see no gain in it when it could simply place its own test instead.”

“I do not know,” the Tianxi admitted. “There is something off about the Trial of Ruins, Angharad. The way it is built, the rules of it. For there to be multiple paths for us to take but the requirement of ten victors at the end? It encourages us to go into smaller groups, fewer than ten, and take risks.”

“What would the blackcloaks gain by seeing us dead?” she asked. “The Dominion of Lost Thing is a method of recruitment, they would not want to throw away lives aiming to swear themselves to the Watch.”

“That is what bothers me most about it,” Song said, brushing back a strand that had come loose of her braid. “But it is not in here we will find answers.”

“Victory makes a moot point of that mystery,” Angharad said. “Best to triumph first and then spare the time to turn over the stones.”

She could see Song disagreed but they did not argue the point. They fell in together, taking the front as was becoming their habit. Their assembled company left behind the eerie cavern, heading into a broad tunnel whose walls occasionally sprouted the same translucent crystals. A few minutes saw their presence thinning, however, until they were entirely gone and the natural stone of the walls turned ornate. Every inch of them was sculpted, faces snarling and grinning. Beasts and men and devils, hundreds of eyes leering at them from every direction.

Every slice of lantern light revealed bared teeth and unblinking stares, as if their advanced was being spied upon.

“I’ve felt less threatened by people threatening to cripple my legs and leave me to die,” Lan noted. “Are we sure we want to keep going this way?”

“There is no other path,” Song replied. “Unless you want to try your luck with the ruins?”

“Hint taken,” Lan cheerfully replied.

She heard Zenzele snort. Setting aside her own misgivings, Angharad put a spring to her step. Song at her side, they sped through the tunnel until it narrowed so much they had to go in a line instead. Squeezing just past the narrowest point – so tight she had to suck in her breath – she stumbled out into great temple grounds. A rounded chamber spread out before her, its bottom floor a display of iridescent pools and stone gardens while slender steps led up to levels circling around the chamber that were filled with Someshwari prayer cells. The pools were fed by waterfalls, the same iridescent waters falling and casting many-colored light around them.

Stone lanterns hung from the walls, all sculpted to look like a beast’s mouth and filled with a trembling light.

“Gods,” Song gasped out, emerging behind her.

“It is beautiful,” Angharad admitted.

But it might prove dangerous even if a spirit had yet to make an appearance. They got out of the way so the others could follow them in. When Tupoc squeezed through, the noblewoman noticed with a start that the shallow cut on his cheek was now nothing more than a scratch. His limp remained, but it did not seem as bad either. What manner of contract was this? Felis and Aines followed behind, the man batting away his wife’s help – though, in truth, he did not seem in such dire straits as believed. While obviously in pain, now that the blade shard had been removed and a makeshift bandage put in place by his wide he seemed in no danger of bleeding out.

He had been lucky, then, or Remund had struck poorly.

Ocotlan was the last through, and after a minute of struggling against the walls it became plain he was too large to pass. To Angharad’s muted amusement he had to take a hammer to the sculptures before he could squeeze through and even then it was a narrow fit. Song had her musket in hand while the shrine entrance was taken a hammer to – and Angharad kept her saber close – but no spirit deigned to show.

“It might be abandoned,” the Pereduri mused. “Though that seems strange, for it is hardly a ruin.”

“There is more than one way for gods to die in this maze, Lady Tredegar,” Tupoc nonchalantly said. “It seems to me the god of this place might have been better served by a fortress than a palace.”

“We are deep in the maze,” Angharad conceded. “It seems likely the strife between spirits would be harshest here, where fewer of the trial-takers reach.”

If the spirits could not feed on the ensouled, they must feed on each other.

“Best to keep our guard up anyhow,” Master Cozme said. “There is little safety to be found outside the Old Fort.”

They agreed that drinking of the iridescent water seemed a poor idea and that it would be best to avoid touching it at all. Avoiding the bottom floor, they held close to the sides and went up the stairs. The prayer cells were adorned with stone mats, with exactly one relief carved into the wall of rooms of otherwise bare stone. Not a speck of dust in sight. The way out of this temple must be further up, Angharad decided when it became clear there was nothing but cells on the first level. They had gone underground quite a bit since the clockwork temple.

Tupoc gestured for them to halt just before they reached the second floor, already reaching for his spear.

“Something ahead,” he murmured. “Prepare.”

Though she resented how close to an order his words were coming, Angharad did not deny the sense in them. Sword in hand she crouched on the stairs, pricking her ear as she heard footsteps approach. Breathing out, she glimpsed ahead.

(Tupoc pulled the blow before it took her in the throat but Shalini shot him twice in the eye, hands like lightning.)

“Wait,” Angharad exclaimed, getting to her feet. “They are not enemies.”

The muzzle of a pistol peeked past the corner, followed by Shalini’s surprised face.

“Tredegar?” she asked, then looked past her to the rest. “Huh.”

The Tianxi soldier Yong, sword in hand, joiner her a moment later as Tupoc laid his spear on his shoulder. Their entire crew was there, she realized. She sheathed her sword.

“Peace,” Angharad called out. “It seems we have matters to discuss.”

—

Tensions ran high, but with no crew inclined to fire the first shot a truce was established. Lord Ishaan revealed they had found an easy path deep into the maze, past a trial of illusions that saw Acanthe Phos cheat copiously with her contract, but that after that a series of dead ends had kept them on a road straight to this very temple – though they came in through the fifth level. They had been here for hours now and it took little prompting for the Someshwari to show Tupoc and Angharad why.

“This is it,” Lord Ishaan said. “We thought them the only way out of the temple but we must have missed your entrance.”

“It is now a dead end anyhow,” Tupoc told him. “The god collapsed its own shrine for spite of failing to take our lives.”

Angharad only half paid attention to their talk, eyes on the gates Ishaan Nair had led them here to see. Three great circles of stone, looking almost like man-sized Aztlan calendars with all their complex radians and concentric circles. Around the rim of every gate was an elaborate stone contraption, each bearing a single needle pointing inwards and moving so slowly around the gate it seemed still if you did not pay close attention.

“- waiting until it opens,” Lord Ishaan said. “The fourth floor is the most luxurious, so we prepared to camp there.”

“You believe the gates will open, then?” Angharad asked.

“They will,” Tupoc replied in his stead. “This is a cyclical calendar, though I do not recognize the god it is dedicated to. Regardless, the engravings give clear time of prayer.”

He tapped the first gate with a finger.

“The seventh hour,” he said, then moved to the others. “The tenth. The fourteenth.”

“We came to similar conclusion,” Lord Ishaan evenly said.

“Odd hours,” Angharad mused. “The sequence does not seem obvious.”

“Numbers dedicated to the god, I assume,” Tupoc said. “Whichever that might be.”

A second look at the speed of the needle and the hours the Izcalli had spoken of allowed her to gauge how long there was left, which was not until tomorrow.

“It seems we will all need to spend the night here,” she finally said.

“Indeed,” Ishaan Nair said. “A more elaborate truce seems in order.”

It was not a difficult bargain, as none were inclined to fight. Lord Ishaan was given right to take the earliest gate in exchange for allowing them to share the fourth floor with his crew – the Someshwari admitted there were water wells and genuine sleeping chambers on it, a luxury they all desired – while Tupoc offered to take the third gate in thanks for her ‘invaluable help’ through the crystal hall. She misliked the ironic tint to his words, but not enough to refuse the offer.

After that, they all settled in for the night.

—

The room on the fourth floor were much preferrable to the prayer cells, as Ishaan had said.

There were wooden beds – without sheets, but Angharad had her own bedroll – and her chambers had a stone basin that she filled with water from the closest well. Most lovely of all was that every room had doors, which could not be locked but could at least be closed. Sleeping chambers were claimed in clusters, all three crews sleeping close and away from their competitors, so she saw little of the others save for a smile shared with Brun. At once tired and energized, she retired early to her room and found herself laying on the bed while looking at the ceiling.

The air was oddly warm here, enough that even in an undertunic and underclothes she could not decide whether she wanted to be inside the bedroll or not. The dim light coming from a small hole in the ceiling did not help, tracing by shadow the silhouette of everything in the room. Rolling around restlessly, she tore her gaze away from the disturbing mosaic on the ceiling that showed black birds falling from the sky like rain and closed her eyes. Surely if she kept at it long enough sleep would ensue. Angharad did not want to approach tomorrow tired and- she reached for her blade the moment she heard the level lock of her door begin to move.

Unsheathing the saber silently as she padded across the room on bare feet, Angharad pressed against the wall to lay in ambush. The scabbard she propped up against the wall, breathing in shallowly when the door to her chambers opened and then just as quietly closed. The assassin took one step, a second and Angharad struck – only for her blade to halt a hair’s breadth away from the throat.

Isabel Ruesta looked down at the steel and swallowed.

“Angharad,” she whispered.

Isabel, she realized, wore nothing but a pale sleeping shift. Sleeveless and with a low neckline that pulled taut at the breasts, pressing them up to draw the eye. The dark-haired beauty’s cheeks were rosy and there could be no doubt as to why another woman who come into her rooms at this hour so dressed. A night visit, and the tension went out of her shoulders – she was not unfamiliar with this game. She took away the blade.

“Isabel,” she replied, then hesitated. “We cannot.”

There was no telling who might be watching, in this strange temple, and too many potential eyes. Tupoc would be looking for anything to hold over her head, and she was not sure Lord Ishaan would refuse an opportunity to sunder their crew. Which a shared bed between them might well achieved, however unfair it might be: Remund would be livid, and if he left Cozme would go with him. Isabel’s eyes widened with surprise, and something altogether colder before the infanzona wiped it away.

“I had not thought you so cowed by House Cerdan,” she evenly said.

Wounded pride bled out every pore. Angharad would have fared no better, had she been refused after sneaking in dressed so flatteringly.

“If this were the Old Fort, I would take the risk regardless,” the Pereduri admitted. “But it would be too easy to get caught here, the doors so close, and there are no sanctuary rules to keep blades out of hands should it happen.”

“We would be twice as likely to get caught at the fort,” Isabel sulked. “The blackcloaks are everywhere.”

She had looked pleased, though at the admission. And soon followed with a sly look, stepping close and pressing her cheek against Angharad’s collarbone. Awkwardly, still holding the sword, she wrapped her arm around the infanzona.

“It would be dangerous to return so quickly to the hall,” she wheedled. “Surely you would not want to risk that.”

Angharad’s eyes strayed down a slender neck, to the rounded valleys pressed up by the cut of the shift and felt the test of her resolve.

“It would be too risky,” she allowed, swallowing.

Isabel pressed a kiss against the side of her neck, hiding her face as she whispered.

“And a few kisses, would you deny me that?”

There she held firm.

“It would not stop at that,” Angharad said. “We both know that.”

Isabel snickered against the crook of her neck, a sensation that had her shivering.

“Perhaps not,” the infanzona admitted. “But hold me a while, at least. I would feel your skin against mine before you send back into the cold.”

And Angharad could not find it in herself to again argue against something she wanted so very much.

To that request, she acceded.

—

Angharad woke to shouting.

We were caught, she thought for a heartbeat, but there was now warmth besides her. Isabel was gone. Relief warred with disappointment over that, though both were scattered by the continued clamor. She stumbled out of her rooms, scabbard in hand, and in the hallway found a dozen from every crew on their feet and armed. Accusations and denials were heatedly exchanged, but she only saw why after a few more steps forward. At the center of the commotion, Aines lay on the temple floor.

No longer breathing, for someone had cut her throat.

# Chapter 27

A secret, Abuela had taught Tristan, always whispered twice.

The first was the secret reaching your ear, the hidden thing unearthed. The second was the whisper of what a man had thought worth wielding a spade to bury, what it said of them they would keep away from prying eyes. He thought of that, as Lieutenant Vasanti called up her soldiers and introduced him as their fresh meat, a new helper in their work to unearth the tower’s secrets who would soon be joined by three more. He thought of it and smiled at the strangers, because the blackcloaks were bringing him to find out the pillar’s secrets but it was not them he truly wanted.

He was going to find out what that Watch had buried here and why they’d buried it.

And once he had had, once he heard the second whisper and he saw the whole of the mosaic instead of a hundred pieces, then he would decide where to slide the knife.

—

The first act he took come morning was sowing the seed Beatris had given him.

“And she told you this in person?” Isabel pressed.

“Last night,” he said. “And as a parting gift to us both, Lady Ruesta, she told me we share a trouble.”

The dark-haired infanzona smiled, and Tristan wondered how long it had taken her to craft this one: friendly but not overly inviting, just a touch cheerful and naïve. Even without the contract Tredegar would have tripped all over her boots around Isabel Ruesta.

“And what would that be?”

Tristan feigned wiping his lips, enough to hide how them from watchers.

“Remund Cerdan,” he said.

Isabel’s smiled widened.

“It is very kind of you to be so concerned,” she said, “but though taken with me he has not been-”

“My sister lost her hands to his contract,” Tristan lied. “He’s a shit and you don’t want to marry him any more than I want him to make it through this trial.”

Oh, the thief thought as he watched Isabel Ruesta’s face shift seamlessly from slightly touched to cool pleasantness. A schemer’s face, but he would wager not her true one. It was just another sort of play she put on, changing role for every stage. She was the most dangerous sort of the snake: the kind that did not announce the venomous fangs with bright colors.

“I did think you were just a little too convenient to simply be a rat,” Isabel mildly said. “Revenge, however, is an expensive business. Which coterie sponsored you?”

“What would that matter to you?” Tristan shrugged.

“Won’t you indulge me?” she asked, batting her eyes.

Was she using her contract? He could not tell if she was. The thought angered him regardless.

“No.”

She looked more amused than miffed.

“So we share a trouble,” Isabel acknowledged. “What do you propose to do about it?”

“Poor choice of words,” Tristan noted, to a quirk of her lips. “And today? Nothing. I have business here in the Old Fort. I need two things from you: a recounting of the venture in the maze and for you to find a place where I might corner him.”

“You want me to spy for you,” Isabel lightly said.

“Spy is such an ugly word,” the thief noted. “Which is fitting given that we are arranging your fiancé’s murder.”

The mask of pleasantness cracked. That, at last, had touched a nerve.

“We are not,” Lady Isabel Ruesta coldly laid out, “engaged.”

“Nor will you ever be, if we help each other,” Tristan smiled back, all charm and friendliness.

From the corner of his eye he saw Angharad Tredegar approaching their table and he cocked an eyebrow at the infanzona. They could not speak long without suspicion, or easily again without causing the same.

“Agreed,” Isabel murmured.

Would she betray him, Tristan wondered? Too early to tell, but only a fool would discount the possibility when faced with such a snake. More likely, though, she would keep this secret in her pocket in case it might ever be of use in getting her home to the life she did not want to leave behind. The thief waited until Tredegar joined them, then made quickly his excuses to leave. He now had eyes in their crew and an accomplice for what was to come.

That was one piece of the mosaic in hand: now he must collect the rest.

—

Talking his comrades into joining Lieutenant Vasanti’s efforts had not been difficult: they were all eager at the thought of getting the Watch’s help and protection. What Tristan had not expected was for the Watch itself to argue over Vasanti’s decision. It was very much the case, though, and after spending so long tiptoeing around the blackcloaks Tristan found it rather lovely to see them tear into each other like this.

“- against every rule,” Lieutenant Wen insisted. “We have a clear set of duties overseeing the second trial and using its takers as labor undeniably goes against them.”

“Oh look,” Lieutenant Vasanti drawled, “the boy has an opinion on rules. That’s nice. In thirty years, I might even start giving a shit about what you think.”

They weren’t even hiding this, the thief gleefully thought. All three of them were in the kitchen, in sight of everyone, and more than a few watchmen were looking at the scene.

“You’ll be dead in thirty years, crone,” the Tianxi snarled.

“And what a relief it will be,” Vasanti replied, “to finallybe beyond the reach of your whining.”

Tristan knew better than to get involved. The Watch was clannish, like a tightly knit coterie, and no matter how at odds the pair got they were sure to band together against an outsider. Instead he sat in his seat, moving as little as he could, and tried very hard not to grin at how red in the face Lieutenant Wen had gone.

“I will kick this up to Captain Tozi if I have to,” Wen threatened.

The large Tianxi lieutenant had always been so sure in his power until now, so willing to toy with all of them. Tristan found that seeing the man’s jaw clench and his eyes flash with anger was good for morale. He’d keep this moment in mind, next time Wen threatened to hammer an entire bucket’s worth of nails into his body.

“The same Captain Tozi you told she’s only been picked for the Academy because she’s nobleborn?” Lieutenant Vasanti replied. “Do wait until I’m in the room to try it, at my age there’s only so many good laughs left ahead of me.”

Lieutenant Wen gritted his teeth.

“Commander Artal-”

“Won’t care what happens outside Three Pines so long as it doesn’t splash his boots,” Vasanti cut in, unimpressed. “He’s just here to pretty up his record before a committee bid.”

The old Someshwari shook her head, as if disappointed.

“Besides, this is all far away,” she said. “In the Old Fort, Wen, I am the senior lieutenant. Do you remember what that means?”

The Tianxi’s face tightened.

“You haven’t run a goddamn thing, Vasanti,” he said. “It’s all been me while you’ve holed up in the pillar with your favorites and-”

“It means,” Lieutenant Vasanti coldly interrupted, “that I am your superior. And your superior has just ordered you to shut the fuck up, so you had best get to it.”

Lieutenant Wen’s face went even redder, which Tristan had not thought possible, and he closed his mouth. He stalked away, not bothering to hide his fury, and the old woman snorted at the sight.

“There’s only so far a pristine combat record will get you, kid, with a mouth like yours,” she said, then sighed. “And you, rat, keep that smirk off your face.”

“I am not smirking,” Tristan said. “And you are not looking at my face.”

Lieutenant Vasanti turned an irritated eye on him.

“I have a fine nose for conceit,” she said. “You positively reek of it.”

“I’ll try to trade for an earlier bath ticket,” Tristan easily replied.

The irritation in her eyes grew.

“Go gather your little band,” she said. “Wen’s going to be a right pain for the rest of the year, so you had better be worth the trouble.”

—

The northwestern bastion was Lieutenant Vasanti’s private kingdom.

That much became clear within moments as five blackcloaks gathered to her like chicks to their mother, coming to around the table by the telescope while looking all eager and polite. The four of them – Francho, Vanesa, Maryam and Tristan himself – were escorted up the stairs by the same middle-aged Someshwari woman Tristan had first thought to be the Vasanti last night. She was, in fact, called Sergeant Ovya.

She also had it in for him.

“I don’t suppose,” the sergeant asked, “that you have any notion of why I’ve ordered to write ‘I will load my pistol properly, like a grown woman’ a hundred times with a charcoal pen?”

“None whatsoever,” Tristan lied.

The Someshwari leaned closer.

“When you inevitably piss her off,” Ovya whispered, “I’ll be sure to ask to be the one to cane you.”

Best nip that in the bud, he decided.

“Sergeant,” Tristan replied, pitching his voice loud and feigning indignation, “that would be quite inappropriate, given your authority over me.”

Surprise flickered across her face a moment, the confusion. At least until she’d noticed he had spoken loud enough to be heard by all the watchmen at the table, several of which were now frowning at her. They’ll remember this if you try to wiggle your way into delivering a caning, he thought. Trying to beat a younger man for refusing her unseemly advances was the kind of thing that would darken her reputation permanently, so odds were she would back off. Sergeant Ovya glared at him.

“You can find your way to the table, I am sure,” she coldly said, then strode away.

There was a moment of silence, then behind him Maryam sighed.

“I’d assumed you talked your way into the good graces of the lieutenant,” she said, “but why is that beginning to feel like optimism?”

“I applied the full breadth of my charms,” Tristan defended.

“Oh dear,” Francho wheezed out. “Where did you even find a cliff to jump off from?”

“Stop teasing him, you two,” Vanesa chided.

She sent a smile his way.

“I’m sure he has angered no more than half of these fine folk,” she added.

Betrayal on all sides, Tristan amusedly thought. Making sport of him seemed to put a little life back in Vanesa’s pale face, so he let it pass without retort. The four of them made their way to the table, where Lieutenant Vasanti was fiddling with a scroll. She shot them an impatient glance.

“Did you go for a stroll first?” she complained. “Come closer, I don’t have all day.”

Which was factually untrue, Tristan thought, but he chose silence. If you kept putting your hand in the crocodile’s mouth, no matter how lucky you were eventually you lost the hand. Vasanti’s eyes swept through the four of them.

“How much did you actually figure out about this place?” she asked, then frowned. “Never mind, I don’t actually care. Let us keep this simple.”

She pointed upwards, at the great golden aetheric machine mimicking the stars and casting its glow on all of the massive cavern.

“The Antediluvians built this place and the pillar that connects the ceiling and floor of this cavern,” she said. “Sometime after, likely beginning as early as the Old Night, devils began building the rest of this place – namely the maze of ruins and the Old Fort.”

Lieutenant Vasanti paused.

“That’s intriguing, but we don’t like the devils here,” she said. “Why do we not like the devils, Biter?”

“It is Bitor, ma’am,” a young man with the Sacramontan look reminded her.

She did not acknowledge his answer in the slightest, which must have been common because he went on without even a sigh and no one looked surprised.

“We do not like the devils here because they sabotaged the iron gates leading inside the pillar,” Bitor dutifully said. “We have found parts of what was almost certainly a mechanism to open them in the basement of the Old Fort.”

Francho cleared his throat, earning a look from Vasanti. She did not insult him, to Tristan’s surprise, not even when the old scholar dipped into a wet cough before he could speak.

“Did the devils tinker with the aetheric machine?” he asked.

She nodded approvingly.

“One of the questions we seek answers for,” Lieutenant Vasanti said. “One of my predecessors blew his way into the pillar, but our progress has since stopped. Some of what was found, however, implies that there are controls for the machine somewhere near the top of the pillar. It is entirely possible the devils got that far and are responsible for the current ‘laws’ enforced by the aetheric device.”

The very underpinnings of the Trial of Ruins, Tristan thought. The reason why they could venture into the maze and take tests: the gods could not harm humans unless terms were first agreed on, only each other, and they could not leave their seats of power. The devils also brought hundreds of shrines and built a fort around the gate to the pillar, the thief thought. What is it they were trying to achieve? He was still missing too many pieces to begin making out the pattern.

“Do we have any notion of why this place was so important to them?” he asked. “They spent many years and much effort on this cavern.”

Lieutenant Vasanti considered him.

“You might not know this, given your youth and lacking education, but it is not uncommon for devils to sabotage or destroy the finest works of the First Empire,” she said. “We have no reason to believe this is any different.”

Liar, Tristan thought. There was a glimpse of the second whisper: Lieutenant Vasanti believed she knew why it was the devils cared about this place and she did not want it known. Known by us, or by everyone? He would have to find out of the other blackcloaks were also being kept in the dark. His instincts had him suspecting they would be. If it was something she could use to get more men and resources, she already would have. It was being kept quiet, perhaps by more than just her.

How many hands were on this spade?

“Good to know,” Tristan smiled. “I take it you have something in mind for us to aid in?”

Lieutenant Vasanti unrolled the scroll she had been fiddling with, spreading it out on the table. It was a drawn schematic of the pillar, Tristan saw, or at least a small part of it. He easily recognized the room where he had almost been shot last night and the stairs on its side, leading up to an intersection. On one side the stairs led to an intricately drawn chamber centered around a complicated machine, while on the other they rose to what looked like a dead end – save for a side door marked as a word in Samratrava he did not know the meaning of. The Someshwari officer tapped a finger on the machine-room.

“There are mechanism in there that respond to Gloam and what might be instructions for their use that we have not deciphered,” Lieutenant Vasanti said. “I haven’t been able to talk a Navigator into coming here, so the girl who can use Signs will have to do.”

She paused, turning to Francho.

“How are you with cryptoglyphs?” she asked.

“My language studies centered on cants, but I am familiar with the Naukratian glyphs,” the old professor toothlessly smiled.

Tristan kept his confusion off his face. He knew what cants were – darkling languages, supposedly descended from the single original tongue the Antediluvians had spoken – but had no notion of what these cryptoglyphs might be.

“Then you’ll be taking a look,” Vasanti said. “The best I managed to get is Luisa here, who is only familiar with one of the Second Empire codexes. She will be your assistant.”

He leaned closed to Maryam.

“Cryptoglyphs?”

“First Empire scientific language,” she murmured back. “Signs are based on it.”

So Francho was familiar with some of the glyphs, while Luisa – a young woman with short blond hair, looking a little nervous – had only read a ‘codex’. The difference between someone who knew the letters and someone who had read a list of words, perhaps? He would make inquiries with Francho when they had the time. However short their exchange, it had caught Lieutenant Vasanti’s attention.

“Stop chattering,” the old woman warned. “Now, for the last two of you I have something else in mind. We’ll be going for a look at the central shaft, then we can discuss what I want from you.”

That did not sound so bad, at least until Tristan saw the grim looks on the faces of the blackcloaks.

—

One of the watchmen, a stout man with unfortunate acne, had to carry Vanesa up the ladder tied to his back.

Much as Tristan would have liked to be allowed to roam inside the pillar, he did not even get to see the machine-room where Maryam and Francho were taken away to. Instead Lieutenant Vasanti led him and Vanesa up the narrow stairs, at a slow pace accommodating of the crutches. They took a right at the crossroads and continued up for another flight, leading right to the dead end the drawings had laid out. Only they had not shown why it was a dead end, a detail that would have been worth the mention.

Someone had buried the last stretch of stairs below massive slabs of stone. A few of the stones were shattered and there were scorch marks on them and the walls, but the effort must have been aborted for it was well shy of anything like a doorway.

“Why stop?” he asked Lieutenant Vasanti, flicking a look at the slabs.

“There were concerns that the amount of powder it’d get through would bring the ceiling down on our heads,” she told him. “That and one of our contractors found out there’s a layer of metal at the back.”

“The door was welded shut?” Tristan breathed out.

“The devils did not want anyone to get past those stairs,” Lieutenant Vasanti said. “They are not creatures prone to half-measures.”

He let out a low whistle. The devils, he thought, were at the heart of this mystery. They had built the maze, built the fort, and gone to great lengths to keep people from being able to enter the pillar before abandoning the Old Fort to the blackcloaks. The secret they care about is in the pillar, he decided. Exactly like the Watch, they had centered their entire presence on the Dominion of Lost Things around what existed in this cavern. Is it all about the golden machine above us? Not, it shouldn’t be. If the devils had been able to get up there, as Lieutenant Vasanti clearly believed, then they would have been able to destroy the Antediluvian machine.

There would have been no need to prevent entrance through the gates or block stairs with stone and steel.

“I don’t see the door shown on your scroll,” Vanesa called out from a few steps down. “It should be around here.”

“There’s a trick to it,” the lieutenant replied, black cloak brushing past Tristan and she came down.

The old Someshwari leaned close to the wall, then pressed her thumbs against a spot. There was a small click, then the stone popped open and the outline of a door swung out half an inch. The lieutenant stepped back and opened it all the way, inviting them to look. It wouldn’t exactly be accurate to call what he saw room, as that would imply it was usable. It was not.

What Tristan was looking it as was a vertical stone shaft at least two miles long that was positively filled with ticking, shifting cogs and wheel. At a central pillar there seemed to be something like a twisting rope made of steel, if rope could be thicker than a carriage. The racket was deafening whenever he put his head through the open door but when he pulled it back out it faded to something more sufferable. So that’s why no one heard the shot last night, he thought. The Ancient built the pillar so it wouldn’t fill their cavern with noise.

Others had more practical interests,

“That,” Vanesa said, leaning on her crutch, “is an overgrown tension engine.”

Lieutenant Vasanti nodded.

“I believe the same,” she admitted. “My guess is that it is part of one of those near-perpetuating engines the Antediluvians loved slapping inside everything – it might provide the power behind the entire shifting machinery in the ceiling.”

“It should have nothing to do with the iron gates, then,” Vanesa opined.

“Not exactly true,” the watchwoman said. “See over there?”

The Someshwari pointed a finger past the threshold, through the mess of steel, and Tristan frowned as he tried to make out what she indicated.

“I can’t make out anything,” Vanesa admitted.

“A door,” the thief said. “About half a level beneath us, there’s an opening in the wall.”

“Maintenance access, like this one,” Lieutenant Vasanti said. “We used a longview to get a better look and we are certain that room connects to others. It might lead us to a way to open the gates.”

Tristan eyed her skeptically. That sounded rather like wishful thinking. Taking in the riot of moving steel inside, the way cogs went up and down and wheels scythed through, he could see why the devils had not bothered to bury this door: no one could go through it without being crushed or rent apart.

“Have you tried to access it from the outside?” he asked. “Shouldn’t be too hard to figure out the corresponding location, then you could blow your way in like this one.”

“We made the attempt,” Lieutenant Vasanti curtly replied. “Three barrels of blackpowder did nothing but scratch the stone. The only reason we were able to force in our way the first time was that there was a crack in the pillar.”

“Then how have you tried to reach the room?” the thief frowned.

Lieutenant Vasanti raised an eyebrow. No, he thought. Surely she couldn’t mean…

“You sent people into that, didn’t you?” he said, pointing at the moving steel.

“Two,” the Someshwari acknowledged. “Volunteers. One lived long enough to come out but the wounds took her in the night.”

“And you haven’t tried since,” Tristan deduced. “If the body count gets too high, the commander in charge of the island will step in.”

The blackcloaks were likely willing enough to let Lieutenant Vasanti molder here so long as that was all she did, but if she started getting their soldiers killed that was another story.

“I was not forbidden to continue the research,” the old woman said, “but I was ordered to find a better avenue than just feeding people to the shaft.”

Vanesa let out a little noise of comprehension.

“So that’s why you have the telescope,” she said. “You’re marking down how the mobile moves above and trying to match it to movements here. You are looking for a safe path through.”

“Clever,” the Someshwari praised. “We have kept extensive records. I am from the aetheric branch of the Umuthi Society, so I will admit that causal mechanics are not my specialty. A clockmaker, however, might see catch I would not.”

“It would be my pleasure to take a look,” Vanesa said. “Not quite as exciting as working with one’s hands to solve the puzzle, but I suppose my days for that are past.”

She did not need to reach for her missing eye, or need to.

“I suppose I should begin to head down now,” the old clockmaker sighed. “It will take long enough.”

“Take the chair in the room downstairs,” Lieutenant Vasanti told her. “I’ll have the records brought to you.”

Vanesa thanked her kindly, and warily began the journey down. Tristan waited for her to be too far to overheard before speaking up.

“How far did you get mapping out the patterns?”

Lieutenant Vasanti grimaced, then spat to the side.

“Some,” she said, “but not as much as I need to justify another attempt. At exactly three past midday every day there is a sequence that repeats, but near the end of the path through there’s a random variable. We haven’t been able to narrow down what causes the differences.”

Tristan cocked his head to the side.

“And by variable you mean…”

“A serrated wheel went right through the dummy we threw yesterday,” she said. “It’s all been along those lines.”

“So this is a death trap,” Tristan flatly said.

“I’m sorry to hear you say that, boy,” Lieutenant Vasanti coldly smiled, “since you’re going right in it.”

He kept the surge of fear off his face. Admitting to it would do nothing but pleased her. The lieutenant had good as told him he was meant for this from the start, Tristan realized. All the others were of use to her – Francho as a historian, Maryam as a Gloam witch and Vanesa as a clockmaker. This murderous place must have been what she had in mind last night, when she’d said she ‘had a use for him’.

Fortuna leaned past the threshold, taking a look inside and retreating with a solemn look on her face.

“Yeah,” she said, nodding decisively. “You’re definitely dying in there.”

Her support was, as always, invaluable.

“How long until the sequence?” Tristan asked, forcing calm.

“Three hours and change,” the lieutenant shrugged. “We have a clock downstairs.”

The thief looked at Vasanti who was staring back with poisonous satisfaction. It seemed unlikely she would let herself be talked out of sending him in there and backing out of their ‘deal’ was not an option. She’d then simply tell Lieutenant Wen he had gone into a forbidden part of the Old Fort without permission and he would be removed from the trials. Had she figured out he intended to kill her last night, was that why so much hostility lurked under the smiles? No, he thought. Tristan had been hated by people before and this did not feel the same – it was not as personal.

It might not be him, the thief thought, that Lieutenant Vasanti was getting back at by sending into the whirling steel.

“Then I shall take that time to prepare,” Tristan said. “I expect you don’t mind me trying to improve my chances?”

The watchwoman’s face was blank, but her face was pulled tight as if holding in a frown or a snarl. Vasanti, he realized, had just gotten angry. Did she want me to beg? He was not too proud for that, and would have if he’d had any inkling it might work. The thief felt as if he were missing something again, but there no time to untangle the snarl.

“Do as you will,” the lieutenant said. “So long as you’re there thirty minutes early.”

Tristan nodded, breathed out and put on a smile.

Now he just needed to figure out how to avoid being buried in pieces.

—

If he was to cheat death he would need help, and that meant Maryam.

The room where she and Francho had gone was guarded by a blackcloak armed with sword and musket, though the man looked more bored than wary. He let Tristan in without a second glance, letting the thief deduce the measure was more about keeping things in than keeping people out.

The first thing he noticed after coming in was the machine.

The drawing had not shown color, so he had not expected the intricate device to be made of some golden alloy.  Its basic shape was simple: a rectangular box atop which twelve cylinders interlocked with pistons had been welded. The cylinders were connected to something like a barrel lying down, though the ‘lid’ of that barrel was dull green glass. The whole thing stood about as tall as a grown man. The intricacies, the parts that filled the room, were the levers.

The box atop which everything rested was open on the sides, revealing slowly turning cogs, but from a golden frame beneath the cogs spurted at least four dozen spindly levers on each side. They were at least five feet long and could be moved, up and down and to the sides, which seemed to make different parts move in the frame beneath the cogs. Maryam’s hand was on one of the levers when he came in, though she took it off when glancing his way.

Francho, who was standing by one of the walls with his blackcloak assistant – Luisa, the thief recalled -immediately noticed.

“Ah, Tristan,” he toothlessly smiled. “I’d wondered if you would come take a look.”

The room around the machine had been stripped bare, much like the one where the blackcloaks had made their base but carved into the bare stone of the walls were narrow stripes. Tristan had to squint to realize that they were in fact small intricate marks, so small and close to each other that from a distance they looked like lines. The mentioned cryptoglyphs, he guessed.

“It is quite the machine,” Tristan said. “Have you made any progress?”

“The professor is a man of great learning,” Luisa eagerly said. “Already we have associated some levers and instructions.”

“I will not be enough to get them working,” Maryam frankly said. “The expectation seems that whoever uses this is able to use Signs corresponding to the cryptoglyphs, but there are dozens mentioned – it would take a full-fledged Navigator to do it, and one with a specialized field of study at that.”

To the thief’s surprise they did not seem to be writing anything down, but that was not his trouble. He’d not come here for the machine.

“I need a word with Sarai, if you do not mind,” he said. “It is about the work that Lieutenant Vasanti gave me.”

Luisa looked away guiltily. Well, that was one way not to get an argument. Francho shrugged.

“It will be hours, if not days, before even a basic understanding of this text can be had,” he said. “Take as long as you need.”

Maryam glanced at him curiously, then at his unspoken invitation followed him out of the room. The armed watchman stopped them, confirming the thief’s earlier suspicion by professionally patting them down to see if they were taking anything out. He then let them out without a word. Tristan only led them up the stairs enough they should not be overheard.

“Trouble,” he said.

“Do you ever bring me anything else?” Maryam drily replied.

“I may well die in three hours,” he said, which earned her full attention.

He told her all of it, even his suspicions about the source of Lieutenant Vasanti’s hostility – though he called Abuela that, and not ‘Nerei’ as the watchwoman had.

“The globe of Gloam you used when we tricked the airavatan,” he said. “Could it be used as a shield?”

She shook her head.

“If it is forcefully shattered, there is a decent chance my brain will be cooked from the inside,” she said.

His eyes widened. Well, if Signs were easy to use everyone would dabble.

“I don’t suppose you have anything else?” he said.

She bit her lip.

“I might be able to drag you back,” Maryam said. “Once. And given how weak my understanding of the Sign is, the ‘hand’ will have to hold thick clothes if you do want your skin to char.”

“That is something,” Tristan acknowledged.

“You should refuse and risk Wen,” she advised him. “He is unlikely to kill you, which this very well might.”

It would have been the clever thing to do, but he could not. His silence spoke volumes, enough that Maryam breathed out.

“Tell me why, at least,” she said.

“If it were just a beating I was headed for, I would take it,” Tristan said. “But Lieutenant Wen will likely remove me from the trials as well.”

Maryam stared him down.

“And if you are thrown out, you lose your chance at Cozme Aflor,” she said, letting out a long breath.

She did not ask whether vengeance was worth gambling with his life, a reminder that they had not come to be companions by mistake.

“I will do what I can,” she finally said. “But a chance is the most I can buy you, Tristan.”

“That is the most I can ask,” he replied, then paused.

Slightly embarrassed, he cleared his throat.

“Thank you,” he added.

It was a dangerous thing for a rat to express gratitude. Few in the Murk had qualms about exploiting debts owed.

“Thank me if you live,” she grimly replied.

—

Visiting Vanesa had been something of an afterthought. He had time before his execution and would not go through that door having left stones unturned. She was comfortably ensconced at the lieutenant’s own desk, pouring through stacks of paper and keeping some notes to the side in a charcoal pen.

“Anything interesting?” he asked.

The old woman almost jumped out of her skin.

“Manes, I didn’t hear you come in,” she said, hand resting on her heart.

He had not tried to sneak, he thought, so she must have been quite absorbed by the reading.

“It is all very interesting, though not as much as the iron gates,” she told him. “They have paid very close attention to the mechanisms directly by the door, mapping out the movements by the hour and drawing them in great detail.”

He leaned in.

“I hear,” he said, “that at three past midday there is a particular sequence.”

She snorted.

“It is an obsession for them,” Vanesa told him. “They have manuscripts’ worth of attempts to match some of the movements to the moving parts near the cavern ceiling.”

“No success?” he lightly asked.

She narrowed her eye at him, not fooled by the tone.

“Why the interest?”

He saw no need to lie.

“I will be attempting a crossing,” he admitted. “The odds seem steep.”

“That is madness,” she said. “We must ask her for more time, you-”

“It will be today, Vanesa,” Tristan gently said. “There will be no convincing.”

The old woman looked at him, then, and though she did not ask anything an understanding passed. She might not have been a rat, born and aged far from the Murk, but she was no fool. She had not come here by choice any more than he. Sadness twisted her worn face, though as a few heartbeats passed it turned to something entirely colder. She was, Tristan realized, angry on his behalf.

How long had it been, since that last happened?

“I cannot solve that sequence for you,” Vanesa admitted. “It is too complex. But there is something else you could do, something they would never consider.”

The thief met her eye.

“I am listening.”

—

He arrived fifteen minutes early instead of thirty, purely to spite Lieutenant Vasanti. The jest was on him, however, for she had only left a watchman there and she arrived five minutes later with a smirk. Vanesa had come up the stairs with him, so at least he did not spend what might be the last minutes of his life alone with a silent blackcloak. Maryam arrived when there were eight minutes left. She stayed close, as if to offer comfort, and the time passed all too quickly. Tristan glanced at the open door, the madness of metal past it, and his heart clenched.

Still, there was no need for a surfeit of losses today so he took off his hat and pressed it into Maryam’s hands. She took it, looking baffled.

“Keep it safe,” he solemnly said.

Maryam glanced at the worn tricorn, then back at him.

“If the hat a symbol?” she tried.

“It’s a really good hat,” Tristan defensively replied. “Keeps the rain out of my face.”

“Well then, that changes everything,” Maryam said, lips twitching.

He smiled back, then turned towards the door. He breathed in deep, trying to settle his nerves and failing.

“Three minutes,” Vanesa announced, eye on her watch.

Lieutenant Vasanti, standing further up the stairs, stared down at him.

“It is not too late to back out,” she told him. “I will turn you over to Lieutenant Wen, but a caning’s the worst you’ll be in for.”

Tristan’s eyes narrowed. Is that what you were after the whole time? For me to give you an excuse to be passed off to Wen, thrown out of the trials. The lieutenant had said that killing him might result in retaliation by Abuela, but if he only failed the trials and the matter was handled by another besides, well she could hardly be blame could she? It would have been natural to feel indignation at that, at being made the pawn of a game between others, but Tristan found he did not.

He was a rat: he’d spent all his life scurrying around the boots of men.

“I thank you for your concern,” the thief pleasantly smiled.

The old woman’s face clenched.

“One minute,” Vanesa said. “Remember what I told you.”

He wrenched his gaze away from the watchwoman, stepping to the threshold of the door. There he counted down in his mind, matching Vanesa’s spoken count of the last seconds, and clutched the small metal orb between his fingers.

“Now,” Vanesa said, and he moved.

—

In whole, it took twenty-one seconds.

He jumped down onto a horizontal cog, keeping low as wheels passed above his head. Three steps, then to the side. The piston tore through, bleeding steam, and he hurried forward before the second one could take him in the side.

Ten seconds.

He grabbed a warm pipe and hoisted himself across, sweaty fingers slipping, dropping down on the spoke of a wheel just a heartbeat too early. The tick of the wheel jostled him, enough he almost fell forward, and he stumbled.

Fifteen seconds, but he was off.

He had missed a beat. He climbed between two wheel, began to crawl through, but they were already too far ahead: he would never make it across before they pressed down enough he got stuck. So Tristan took the long odds, bet on Vanesa’s cleverness.

He borrowed, borrowed deep, and as a ticking began that drowned out even the cacophony of this place he blindly threw the small metal ball he had taken from the forge. For a moment there was nothing

Then metal screamed, the gears grinding to a halt.

Stuck, as Vanesa had told him it would be. No matter how good the clock, she had said, sometimes all it took was a grain of sand. He hurried through, dropping down on the pipe, and then there was a crushing sound. The ball was broken, the gears began moving, but he was almost through and…

Eighteen seconds.

He did not see the piston until it was too late. The damned thing came not from the side, like all the others, but from above. He moved in time, or almost: it caught the edge of his hand, a mere brush of the massive thing enough to break it.

He swallowed a scream, forcing himself to go forward, but he’d missed the timing. He could see the door, but before he could jump through the wheels coming from the side would cut through his limbs. He tried anyway, leaning forward.

Twenty.

He heard a distant shout, felt a cool wind, and something grabbed him by the back. Maryam. He was shoved forward, through the open door, as something sharp clipped the edge of his coat.

Twenty-one, and Tristan was through.

—

He landed belly first on the stone, barely taking in the sight of small stone chamber before he released the luck. Tristan braced himself with a wince, looking for from where the hurt would come, but as he flipped back on his back nothing happened. His wince deepened.

Those prices were always the worst.

The thief got back on his feet, swallowing a curse at the throbbing pain of his finger. The room was small and mostly empty, but that there was anything left at all was promising. There a set of stone shelves to the side, empty and coated in dust, and on the other wall the tiling was in some elaborate green pattern as well as striated by cryptoglyphs. The part that caught his attention, though, was the rod left propped up by the shelves. A length of metal about four feet long, it ended in a metal brand made of the same golden alloy as the machine from earlier. There was no obvious use for it, however, so he tore his eyes away.

There was only one door out, to the right, so he quietly moved into the next room. There he stopped after two stuttering steps, eyes fixed to the display taking up an entire wall. He had seen rows of metal tiles like this before: he was looking at an exact match for the tiles at the center of the iron gates leading into the pillar. Suppressing his excitement he swept the rest of the room – two doorways out, both closed doors – before getting closer. The tiles here were adorned with a single black glyph each, unlike those outside, and peeking behind them they seemed to be connected to a series of pistons and gears going into the wall.

Lightly he dared push a stile and found it easily gave, pressing back the piston behind it. He stopped before anything could come of it.

“Well,” he said, “that might just get us into the pillar.”

Leaning against the wall with her arms crossed, long red sleeves billowing, Fortuna scoffed.

“I would worry more about getting out of this place, if I were you,” she said. “Unless you intend to try the cogs again?”

Tristan grimaced, glancing at his broken and swelling finger. He’d been lucky that was all he had paid for the passage with. Fortuna was right, he needed to find a way to return to the Old Fort instead of getting caught up in the exploration. The door next to her was smooth stone with only a small round opening where a lock should be, and he was not fool enough to risk putting a finger in there. His goddess cleared her throat, pointing just to the right of her blond locks. There was a small indent in the wall, he realized, and nestled in it were three stone buttons covered with a strange writing he had never before seen.

“Well spotted,” he praised.

She huffed.

“At least one of us should end up a passable thief,” she replied.

He rolled his eyes at her. The stone buttons came out easily and he took one, then pocketed a second out of habit. Tempted as he was to try to open the stone door with the obvious key, he instead had a look at the other. More of that golden alloy he kept seeing, and a more traditional door as well: a simple latch kept it closed. He pried it open, or tried to: the moment he touched the latch it came loose and drooped to the floor with a tinkling sound. The door cracked open an inch.

Tristan paused: that had felt uncomfortably like luck turning on him.

When he risked a glance trough the open door, however, he found no danger. Dim light with no visible source revealed a curving hallway of stone, ending in a distant door. The thief opened the door all the way and stepped into the hall, careful to keep his steps light. After a dozen steps he caught sight of a door that had been hidden by the curve. Green glass, but almost transparent and through with he thought he was seeing-

“Tristan,” Fortuna suddenly said.

He stilled instantly, for in the goddess’ voice he had heard fear.

“Walk back into that room,” she whispered. “Very slowly.”

There was a sound like a breath, amused.

“Good advice.”

Oh fuck. He was not an utter fool, so he’d begun running the moment he heard the breath, but even so he was too slow. The large shape dropped from above and he caught sight of slimy scales before throwing himself to the side – the hit had his broken finger throbbing. Something like a hand – the size of his torso – passed close enough to ruffle his hair. He scrambled to his feet, glimpsing globulous yellow eyes before breaking into a run for the door.

He had time to take a single before the lights of the hall went out.

Oh, fuck, Tristan thought. He threw himself to the side again, running on pure instinct, and felt something massive and wet pass less than an inch above his back. Worse it stayed there, dripping some kind of stinking pus. The thief rolled to the side, narrowly avoiding something trying to snatch him up, and broke into a running start again. Light came through the open door to the tile room, revealing that the wet thing was a deformed red tongue twice the length of a man, and Tristan almost whimpered when it withdrew, sucked in with a slurp. He got through the doorway and tried to slam the door shut behind him, but the latch was still broken.

That fucking latch was going to get him killed.

“You smell,” the god said, “like hubris. Delicious.”

He could not have described that voice, save that it was sick and somehow it felt like a tongue dragging across his skin. Trying to master his panic Tristan ran for the other door, miraculous having not dropped the stone button.

Then the lights in the room went out.

“No,” he snarled, feeling the god enter the room from the movement of air alone.

Was he really going to die here just because he could not see in the dark? He began groping for the opening but he could not quite recall where –

“Here,” Fortuna hissed, guiding his hand.

Fortuna, who like the god after them no more needed light to see than she needed air to breathe. He pressed the button into the hole and the door popped open, and light came through. Hands scrabbling against the stone, Tristan hurried through and slammed the door behind him – turning to see horrifyingly human-like teeth the size of his hand biting down at where he had been standing, a too-long throat convulsing behind them.

The door snapped shut, the stone button falling out of the opening on his side and rolling down the stairs he now stood on.

Tristan slowly followed it down, limbs trembling and eyes unblinking as he kept staring at the door. He slid down the wall, falling into a crouch. His eyes never left the door separating him from the room where he had just almost been eaten alive. Fortuna set a hand on his arm, and sitting by his side, and eventually his breathing steadied.

“That thing,” he croaked out, “heard you talk to me.”

“It is an old god,” Fortuna murmured. “Perhaps as old as I am.”

The thief passed a hand through his hair, then forced himself to get back standing.

“It does not seem able to pass the door, at least,” he said. “There is that.”

Not that he intended to linger here regardless. Not when he could almost feel what lay on the other side of the stone, patiently waiting to sink its teeth into his flesh. Tristan, forcing calm, picked up the fallen stone button and headed down the narrow stairs. They looked much like the ones he had climbed on the other side of the pillar, and were pointed in the direction he believed to be outside. At the bottom of the flight was a long room of bare stone, whose monotony was broken up by only two things: the first was what looked like a folded ladder of golden alloy, three feet wide and folded so many times he could only guess at the length.

The other was a series of black triangles painted on the wall before him, around slight triangular stone protrusions. Heartbeat rising, the thief pressed on one of the triangles and found it sunk into the wall with a metallic click. There were nine others and he pressed them all, each clicking into place, and after the last there was the dim sound of wheels turning.

The wall before him shivered, then began to rise, and Tristan had never seen anything so beautiful as the expanse of the dark cavern laid out before him.

# Chapter 28

Tristan could not figure out how to make the damn folded ladder work, so he ended up bleating like a lost goat for half an hour before one of the watchmen on patrol heard him.

It was another ten minutes after that of Lieutenant Vasanti and her minions asking him through shouts to describe the device in detail then failing to get it work. In the end one of the blackcloaks just threw him a rope ladder, giving up the machinery for a lost cause. It was only watchmen when he came down, with one exception: Maryam. It was a dangerous habit to start seeing what you wanted to see, so the thief did not let himself believe it was relief he saw in those blue eyes. They had chosen trust, but there was no guarantee that would last beyond the trials they were undertaking.

The given hint that she had aimed from the start at cooperation in a greater undertaking was to be set aside. Then future was a foreign land, not to be relied upon. The dark-haired woman strode through the throng of blackcloaks, some of them snickering, and for a heartbeat it looked like she was going to embrace him.

Instead she slapped his hat down against his chest.

“There,” Maryam said. “I tried to sell it, but it was such a raggedy thing I could find no takers.”

“Blind and a poor haggler, then,” Tristan mused, setting it back on his head. “It’s a lucky thing I made it back. What would you do without me?”

“Luck,” she said. “When the pebble stays stuck in your boot after the shake, is that what you call it?”

A sigh, but not hers. Lieutenant Vasanti wrinkled her nose at them.

“I don’t know what this is,” she said wiggling a finger in their direction, “but it’s putting me off dinner. Cease immediately.”

The thief tossed the lieutenant a carved stone button. She caught it, rather spry for her age.

“It’s a key,” he told her. “Best to get a few muskets pointed at the door before using it, though. There’s a god on the other side and he simply cannot wait to have someone over for dinner.”

The old woman looked nonplussed.

“That’s what salt munitions are for,” she said. “Good work, boy.”

“I live for your praise,” Tristan drily replied.

Lieutenant Vasanti wanted a detailed report, but he told her he wanted a physician first so as a compromise he got to tell her about his misadventures while the garrison doctor saw to his broken finger. To his surprise, she seemed to care little about the god. It was the room with the tiles she was most interested in, demanding he describe it several times while taking notes, and one more detail besides: the metal rod with the alloy brand at the end. That she cared about so much she asked he draw the brand from memory. Tristan did, charcoal pen scratching against cheap paper.

“It might not be exactly that,” he warned. “I only saw it in passing.”

She hummed, eyes on the drawing as she only half-listened.

“What is it about the brand that interests you so much?” he asked.

To his surprise, she deigned to answer. He had expected a cutting comment and a dismissal.

“People tend to think of the Antediluvians as a nation of living gods, shaping the world to their whim, but that was only true for the First Empire’s ruling class,” Lieutenant Vasanti said. “Someone had to clean the dust off the wonders and keep the cogs turning.”

The urge to fiddle with the splint the physician had put around his broken finger was near overwhelming, but he forced himself to think instead. The man was gone back to the barracks, if the splint snapped he was on his own.

“The rod was some kind of tool, then,” Tristan deduced, cocking his head to the side.

“The greats of the First Empire could all manipulate aether much like Navigators can shape the Gloam,” Vasanti told him. “Their servants, though, were not so gifted. So how does a living god avoid having to get their own carriage working when the thing runs on aether?”

“By making tools that can affect the aether,” he said.

“That’s what that brand is, boy,” Lieutenant Vasanti said, not hiding her excitement. “It is our way to get one of the machines working without the need for a Navigator. If we are lucky, it will have been crafted for the tiles and let us open the front gate heedless of Hell’s sabotage.”

The burst of enthusiasm waned, however, and with it the lieutenant’s willingness to indulge his curiosity. She left him to his seat, telling him he was no longer needed for the afternoon, and went to consult with her band of followers. Tristan watched her back getting further and further away, considering how furious she would be should she ever learn he’d held back in his report.

He had not told her of the second stone button in his pocket, or the green glass door.

With Vasanti’s departure others were finally free to approach. Maryam and Vanesa both joined him at the table, the latter helped onto the seat by his pale-skinned accomplice. They seemed in a fine mood, Vanesa in particular. He quickly learned his survival was not the only reason.

“Everyone has been pulled off the sky-watching,” Vanesa told him. “The lieutenant wants us studying mechanisms around the tiles on the iron gates. She believes they are some sort of combination lock.”

The old clockmaker, as it turned out, preferred steel to figures. She was glad to be back on the gates instead of continuing to match the ceiling machine’s movements to that of the inner cogs.

“Francho and I are still on the machine, but she is no longer insistent I start pushing Gloam at it like a toddler throwing a ball,” Maryam said. “I do not suppose you know why?”

“I might have found a tool that can serve in your place,” Tristan said.

“Good news,” Vanesa enthused. “Once it is brought down-”

“It is behind a locked gate guarded by a monstrous old god that tried to eat me,” he told her.

“Ah,” Vanesa muttered. “That puts something of a damper on things, admittedly.”

Tristan scraped together a meal for the three of them out of what lay around the kitchen, mostly dried fruits and bread, but soon enough the pair’s break was at an end. They still had work to do for Lieutenant Vasanti, unlike him. Vanesa was the first to head back, giving them a knowing smile. Tristan supposed that the amount of plotting in dark corners the two of them did was not helping with that misunderstanding. When Maryam spoke, though, it immediately claimed his full attention.

“The use of your contract was too obvious not to be caught this time,” she said. “Already rumors are getting around, and your timely throw against the gravebird has not been forgot. You might want to get ahead of this before speculation grows wild.”

Before someone ascribed him the power to stop cogs with a thought, predict the future and maybe also fly, she meant. Nothing got so out of hand as rumors about contracts: back home there were so many tales about what the legacy contracts of the Six could do that if all were true the nobles would be more divine than their own gods. Thankfully Tristan had a lie ready for this, the same he had been using for years when the need was forced on him.

“Telekinesis,” he said without batting an eye. “I can move small objects with some degree of strength, but I have difficulties with control and there is often backlash.”

Maryam cocked an eyebrow at him. His answer had been a little too quick to be believable.

“A lie,” Tristan shrugged. “But the effects are similar enough it would be difficult to argue otherwise.”

“It does sound like the kind of contract with a minor god a man of no background might obtain,” she admitted after a moment.

It took genuine effort not to flinch when Fortuna slammed her fist on the table – which made not a sound and did not shake it, as it was only on his flesh she could feign to touch – and she leaned forward with flashing eyes, pointing an accusing finger at an unseeing Maryam.

“Minor?” she shrieked. “Minor?”

The goddess shook her finger angrily.

“How dare you, Maryam Khaimov,” she snarled. “I was going to sell you to her on the cheap, Tristan, but this… heresy cannot be brooked. You must defeat her in single combat. Avenge my honor, and be a brute about it.”

The thief sipped at his cup of water, smiling.

“Have I told you I like your tresses?” he asked Maryam. “They suit you well.”

She slowly blinked.

“Treachery,” Fortuna sputtered, stumbling back in shock. “Stop that, Tristan, stop that right now.”

“You have very good taste in boots,” he told Maryam.

She squinted at him.

“Are you…” she slowly said. “Are you using me to anger your god?”

The grey-eyed man simply smiled and complimented her dress, Fortuna’s indignant shouting like a soothing lullaby.

—

Tristan spent most of the afternoon trying very hard not to fiddle with his broken finger, drinking dandelion tea and considering what he should do.

It was only a matter of time, he figured, until Lieutenant Vasanti tried again to be rid of him by sending him through the stone door. He could not be sure that the god would be lying there in wait, but it did seem likely: how long had it been since the entity last had an opportunity to feed? Worse, it did not seem to be affected by the ‘laws’ the aetheric machine above was subjecting the gods of the maze to. It had certainly not been shy in trying to gobble him up.

No, the more he thought about it the more likely it seemed that the lieutenant would send him in. Vasanti wouldn’t use blackcloaks, no matter her talk of salt munitions, for the same simple reason she had not kept sending people to cross the same lethal machinery Tristan barely survived: if too many got killed, there would be consequences she could not afford. As the thief did not fancy his chances against the god even if he was sent in to, he would need to make other arrangements.

First, he needed a sword hand. He and Maryam worked very well as a pair, but it could not be denied they were not the finest of fighters. Tristan knew of one man with the required capacity for violence and that he still trusted more than most in the Trial of Ruins. The real question was this: had they made enough progress along this path that Yong would consider them a better bet than continuing with the maze? After wrestling with the question for some time, sketching arguments for either side, he finally decided an answer could not be had until the crews returned tonight.

If they returned tonight, he corrected as the hours stretched out.

It was now late in the afternoon, and it was possible that some of the crews had got far enough in the maze that they would prefer to spend the night there rather than double back. Tristan was not afraid of anyone passing the second this trial early, for it would be impossible for any single crew to have ten victors and they had all taken different paths.

It was becoming clear, however, that he was running out of time for his other affairs. He had neglected vengeance in the name of more immediate dangers, but now that there was a light at the end of that tunnel he could turn his attention back to the business: Tristan had no intention of allowing the Cerdan brothers or Cozme Aflor to live. The deal he had struck with Isabel should buy him the opening he needed, but he needed for the crews to return to the Old Fort before he could slither his way in. It was that understanding that had him keeping an eye out for any return until at last his patience was rewarded.

More or less.

Lord Augusto Cerdan, looking quite haggard, stumbled into the Old Fort come early evening. The infanzon looked as if he had been thrown down the side of a mountain, boasting such an extensive collection of scrapes and bruises that the broken arm no longer stood out. The worst was a nasty rip going down the side of his now-broken nose to halfway down his throat. The skin had been scraped off by something raw, and though it was not a dangerous wound it was one that would be disfiguring for months. He began calling for the Watch physician within moments of entering, quite loudly – Tristan noted with amusement that the doctor in question pointedly took his time doing up his buttons before moving to answer – and was soon being seen to in the kitchen.

Lieutenant Vasanti had released everyone for the evening, so it was not Tristan alone who came out to the courtyard to have a look at the infanzon’s bruises being cleaned with alcohol.  Maryam drifted close, as if by coincidence, and leaned against the wall by his side.

“Alone and wounded,” she idly said. “Lord Augusto must be feeling rather exposed.”

Tristan knew little of the people of what the Malani called the northern colonies, the Triglau. Oh, islanders called them fierce savages who fought garbed in steel and raided settlements from the back of their hardy mountain ponies, but if you believed the Malani every war they had ever fought had been against hateful villains while the brave people of the Isles only ever reluctantly took up arms for the common good. You had to take the Malani with a grain of salt, for all that they rarely lied.

Looking at the way those blue eyes were watching Augusto Cerdan, though – like a hunter watching a stag, measuring it for the knife – he thought there might be some truth to the stories out of the Isles. That was not the stare of someone who balked at the thought of violence, who saw anything wrong with the lay of Vesper being decided by the cut of a blade.

Tristan supposed he should have been put off by the sight, but he was not. How could he be when he’d seen eyes like those all his life, saw them every time he looked in a mirror? People like Angharad Tredegar, like Augusto Cerdan or even Vanesa, they thought of violence as an intrusion. A break in the default state of peace. They had lived all their life behind the walls of the garden where laws mattered and served to protect, never grasping that beyond the wall violence was the law. You took from those who could not protect and kept what you could protect from those who would take it: that was the truth of Vesper, to a rat.

Triglau, Tristan thought as he watched those pale blue eyes, must not have been so different.

“Very,” he finally agreed, looking away. “So much that I think him unlikely to leave the fort for some time.”

And while in here, protected by sanctuary, Tristan would not risk killing the infanzon. The risks were too great when both lieutenants in command of the fort had it out for him.

“He will have to come out sooner or later,” Maryam murmured.

“He is bound to the trials,” Tristan pointed. “To return home as anything but a peace concession in the making, he must survive his brother and Isabel Ruesta. If there is to be a list, he would be last.”

“So the younger must come first,” she murmured.

The thief was somewhat impressed she had caught that. Remund Cerdan must indeed come before an attempt on Cozme Aflor could be made.

His two enemies under Tredegar were the hardest to get at, by virtue of the mirror-dancer being their protector, but with Isabel out to get Remund killed he would have someone interfering on his behalf. More importantly, it would force Cozme to move. After that, the man would have two choices: either he swallowed his pride and went to Augusto, to get at least one Cerdan home and hope it would be enough, or he cut ties with House Cerdan entirely and tried for the Watch as a refuge. If he went to Augusto he became easier to get at, as Tupoc Xical had all the loyalty of a jackal, and if Cozme aimed for the Watch then Tristan would have the entire third trial to get to him.

“There are plans in the works,” he said.

“Very sinister,” Maryam praised. “Have you considered growing a beard so you might stroke it?”

“Ha,” Fortuna snorted from behind him. “He wishes.”

The Lady of Long Odds had entirely forgot her sworn enmity of a few hours ago, as was her way, and was not merrily siding against him once more. The thief rolled his eyes.

“Come,” he said. “Let us see what our good friend Lord Augusto has to say.”

—

The eldest Cerdan was not only inclined to talk but rather vigorously friendly.

He spun a tale of woe, telling all four of them – Vanesa and Francho, curious, also joined them at the table – of the many indignities he had suffered since Angharad Tredegar’s false accusations forced him to make common cause with the bandit Tupoc Xical. Going with the Aztlan had been what he wanted, he assured them.

“She even got to Lord Ishaan, you see,” Augusto told them. “A nice enough man but very gullible. He had no chance at all against as skilled a trickster as Lady Angharad.”

Tristan had known heads of cabbage more skilled at trickery than Angharad Tredegar, but he smiled encouragingly instead of laughing in the man’s face. He need not look around to see the obvious fabrication had found no takers: the Pereduri was widely respected. The infanzon told them of Tupoc being a slave driver with no regard for rank, of Felis being insolent and insubordinate while Aines was useless. However obtuse, Augusto soon realized that insulting the married pair everyone here had spent the first trial with won him no friends.

He immediately changed tack, focusing on the shrines and the gods.

The infanzon revealed nothing that Tristan had not already heard from Lan, save when it came to today’s events. Tupoc’s crew had made very fine progress after crossing a broken bridge, Augusto recounted, but then been forced to go underground and wait for some time before they were let into some kind of crystal labyrinth. In there had been illusions and attacks, until the entire thing collapsed onto their heads. Augusto has narrowly survived, buried alive but falling through a crevasse. From there he had stumbled into some manner of empty crypt and found a path back to the Old Fort.

“I now hold the knowledge of a safe route deep into the maze,” Augusto told them. “There is but a single shrine on the way, and I have defeated the god’s test: I stand before you a victor.”

He was, in fact, sitting. And carefully avoiding giving any specifics about the shrine he had beaten, enough that Tristan suspected he was either lying or it has been mortifyingly easy to defeat. It was when, between two boasts of knowing a crucial path, Augusto half-heartedly apologized for sending Tristan away from his group during the Trial of Lines – the thief was informed that Tredegar had insisted and convinced the others, so Augusto’s hand had been forced – that Tristan realized what the noble was after.

“Why,” Augusto nonchalantly said, “I expect that the path is so easy even the five of us could reach the end of the maze using it.”

The man was in the market for a delving crew, preferably full of expendables and under his captaincy. Tristan could only wonder if it was desperation or arrogance that had the infanzon thinking there was anyone left that might want to go under him.

“How impressive,” Maryam mildly said.

As he did about half the time he glanced her way, Augusto smothered a moue of disgust at the paleness of her skin.

“Indeed,” the eldest Cerdan agreed. “But it is my duty as an infanzon to provide for others.”

Francho almost choked on the water he had been drinking. He coughed under Augusto’s suspicious eye.

“The cough simply won’t leave me,” the toothless old man said. “I did not mean to interrupt, my lord, do go on.”

“Oh, but I have talked quite enough I think,” Augusto said. “What is it that the four of you have been doing, if not seeking to pass the trial? I saw the blackcloaks made some sort of discovery.”

Lieutenant Vasanti had yet to manage to get the folded ladder to unfold, but the rope ladder was easy enough to see.

“We have been given tasks by Lieutenant Vasanti to advance the Watch’s interests in this place,” Tristan replied. “Secrecy is paramount, I am sure you understand.”

He glanced at the others, who looked willing enough to follow his lead in this.

“Of course,” Augusto said, frowning when no one else added anything. “Though I imagine you will be free by tomorrow?”

“That is not for us to determine, my lord,” Tristan said. “We are in the service of the Old Fort’s commanding officer until released.”

The bruised noble looked at the others, seeking someone who might contradict what had been said, but instead only got silence. Looking miffed but knowing better than to push his luck when his position was so weak and a Watch lieutenant was involved, Augusto gave way. He changed the subject, returning to complaints about his old crew. Tristan thought there might be a purpose to it, at first, but eventually came to realize that the noble mostly wanted to vent.

Maryam and Francho excused themselves before long, but the thief forced himself to remain in case anything of use was revealed. Vanesa, he suspected, simply pitied him enough to suffer through the whining.

“Both of the Aztlan are as wild animals,” Augusto told them. “Xical is from Izcalli, so that was only to be expected, but Ocotlan is no better even after a lifetime under enlightened rule.”

Ocotlan’s tattoos and build marked him as legbreaker for the Menor Mano, one of the largest coteries in Sacromonte, so Tristan was thoroughly unsurprised. The Mano liked their enforcers brutal.

“Life in the Murk can be very difficult,” Vanesa said. “Not all who resort to violence enjoy it, Lord Augusto.”

“That man does,” Augusto haughtily replied. “He spent much time boasting of the work he had done for his ‘patrons’, bloody stories that had him grinning and chuckling.  He proudly told me of beating a man to death before his son and of drowning another in a waste bucket.”

That sounded about right, the thief thought, and his interest waned entirely. What did he care of an infanzon’s shock at the true face of the city his ilk so liked to claim having turned into a paradise? Augusto Cerdan would have gone his entire life without caring a whit about what took place in the Murk every day, if he had not been told of it. In truth he still cared nothing, Tristan knew, and only used the talk of savagery as a way to complain of his former companions. If he somehow survived the Dominion and returned to the Cerdan, the infanzon would forget everything he had learned in matter of hours.

The thing with mud was that when you were a noble you had servants to wipe it off your boots.

“- and he bragged of having done work for his patrons even after they had decided to send him off to these cursed trials,” Augusto bit out. “Breaking the leg of some-”

Vanesa might be willing to indulge the fool, but Tristan’s patience ran out. He feigned having been called by Maryam and went her way, sending the clockmaker an apologetic glance that she did not notice. Was she truly interested in the Cerdan’s words? Surely she could not be as spellbound as she looked. Vanesa was too kind for her own good, he thought not for the first time. The older of the Cerdan brothers certainly seemed pleased at having such a willing audience, almost eager to answer her questions.

Tristan might have pitied him for being so obviously starved of regard, had he not been a Cerdan.

The man was of that accursed house, however, so instead the thief put it out of his mind and went to attend to one of the secrets he’d dug up. Keeping one of the stone buttons he had taken in the pillar was not much different from keeping a key behind Lieutenant Vasanti’s back, in practice, as he could do little with the object but open a door. It was a way to get to the secrets, not a bearer of secrets itself. For him, anyway.

Francho, who could listen to the voices in stone, would find it otherwise.

The old man was not hard to find: he was napping in his bedroll, snoring quite loudly. Tristan almost felt bad about waking him up, but the sooner he had answers the sooner he could begin to sketch out the end of this trial. The toothless professor smacked his lips as he was gently shaken awake, eyes unseeing for a moment before he woke entirely.

“Trist-” he began, then fell into a fit of coughing.

The thief waited for them to end, then caught the man’s eye.

“You will have a hard time having a good night’s sleep, if you nap for too long,” he said as he pressed the stone button into the man’s hand.

Francho’s eyes widened but he caught on quick.

“That is true, I suppose,” the old man said. “Perhaps I should go for a walk. Any suggestions?”

‘Where is this from?’

“As long as it’s not up in the pillar,” Tristan said, feigning a small laugh. “The god there would not make for fine company.”

“Not much of an answer,” Francho snorted. “Should I ask the lieutenant?”

‘Does Vasanti know about this?’

“Surely not,” Tristan said. “She might take it as advances.”

“It is never too late for love, my boy,” Francho laughed.

Good, they were now on the same page. Tristan drew back, offering a hand to help the old man up. Francho took it, letting himself be pulled close.

“Too faint,” the old man murmured. “It will take me hours to make out the words, come back tonight.”

Inclining his head in agreement, the thief smiled. He could wait.

—

It took longer than Franco had said: the professor came to talk only an hour before midnight.

They sat at a kitchen table sharing a bowl of cabecitas, the old Liergan classic of crispy mushroom slices. These were in the Sacromontan style, salt but no pepper, and just like back home the garrison kept them by the barrel. Francho was toothless, so he broke the crisps with his lips and sucked on them until they were so mushy he could slurp them down. It wasn’t appetizing to look at, but the slow pace would give them an excuse to sit here until they were done talking.

“The history of this place,” Francho said, “comes in three parts.”

He traced a circle on the table before breaking off another piece of cabecita.

“First is an island on what was not yet the Trebian Sea,” he says. “The Antediluvians, for reasons known only to them, build this pillar and the aetheric machine. Then comes the Old Night, and as the First Empire falls the island is abandoned.”

“And the devils come,” Tristan said.

“And the devils come,” Francho agreed. “They get into the pillar, tinker with the great machine then break the doors so that no one else can do the same. They then build the Old Fort and begin the centuries-long labor of building the maze.”

The old man paused.

“Only it is not so simple as that,” the professor said. “None know for sure what took place during the Old Night, if the Flood truly took place or if is mythology, but it is beyond debate that the fall of the First Empire caused mass migrations of people and darklings. It is during this era that the islands of the Trebian Sea first began to see settling, among them this very Vieja Perdida.”

“And the devils simply let them?” Tristan frowned.

“There would not have been many of them,” Francho shrugged. “These settlers – not darklings, at least not yet – would be the same people that built the circles of raised stones and I believe them to have been, if not friends to the devils, at least not enemies.”

Tristan took a moment to swallow that. All his life he had been told of the wickedness of devils, that they could not be trusted. They were not like hollows, who could be bargained and lived with, but something fundamentally evil. Even the devils who had signed the Iscariot Accords and been allowed to live among humans beyond the walls of Pandemonium were only biding their time until they began to devour men again. But it might have been different back then, he thought. It could not be denied that devils preyed on men, but so did other men.

In a time of bloody chaos like the Old Night, would the settlers have seen Hell’s denizens as all that worse than their other enemies?

“It is said that the Watch took this island from hollows, not men,” the thief noted.

“It is a common and well-documented phenomenon for the population of islands without a natural source of Glare to progressively turn hollow over the span of generations,” Francho dismissed. “I imagine that the cultists of our day are descended from those very settlers, twisted by centuries in the dark.”

Tristan slowly nodded.

“I take it the third part is when the Watch arrives,” he said.

“After the signing of the Iscariot Accords, the blackcloaks built the Rookery as the seat of their order and began spreading their influence across the Trebian Sea,” Francho said. “I will spare you the history lesson about the order’s conflicts with Sacromonte – in those days still attempting to revive the Second Empire – and say only that most of the Watch’s power in those days was still bound east, to the century-long siege of Pandemonium and its later sealing.”

“They did not have coin or manpower to waste,” Tristan translated. “Yet they still came here and seized the Dominion from devils and darklings. Why?”

This, he thought, was the thread to pull at. If he could learn why had the Watch come and why it had stayed everything else would fall into place.

“I have spent the last three hours,” Francho said, “figuring out the answer to that question by listening to the voices of the devils who once used your button. It all comes down to a very slight mistake, Tristan, that compounded over centuries.

The toothless professor shivered, slurping down his piece of mushroom and subtly pressing the stone button against the side of the bowl as he reached for another crisp. Tristan palmed it just as discreetly, then waited as Francho began to violently cough. It was only after a minute of long breaths that the old man opened his eyes and began to speak.

“When the blackcloaks first came to Vieja Perdida,” he rasped, “the darklings who dwelled on it spoke what is called a Trebian cant. That is to say, one of the family of languages descended from what was spoken here during the First Empire. Traces of that root language, Tristan, remain all across the Trebian Sea – the Asphodel Rectorate, for example, still uses such a cant for its formal ceremonies.”

“There was a mistranslation of some kind,” Tristan guessed.

“The word was one the ancestors of the darklings learned from devils, which the Watch would have recognized,” Francho said. “But then the island was isolated for centuries. Their accent grew, so when the blackcloaks asked their questions half the terms were misconstrued.”

He paused.

“When we encountered cultists, Tristan, did you notice they scarred and tattooed themselves?”

“With a red eye,” Tristan agreed, then frowned.

He remembered the mace-wielding cultists that might have killed him if not for Maryam’s use of a Sign, the way his cheeks had been scarred with red ellipses. But would Tristan have called them eyes, had he not already known the hollow belonged to a cult of that name?

“It’s not an eye, is it?” he asked.

Francho smiled.

“Mouth,” he said. “Or perhaps maw. It is the god the cult worships, and likely the rumor the Watch first came here to investigate.”

And now it all began to make sense.

“You told me the circles of raised stones the settlers built were built by the river because rivers are boundaries,” Tristan said. “That it could mean the boundary was being either weakened or strengthened.”

And it had to be strengthened, for the airavatan to have been kept out by their mere existence. The same settlers who had raised those stones had been on good terms with the devils, Francho had just told him, and the shape of it all lit up in his mind’s eye.

“I believe they were built,” Francho said, “for the very same reason the devils built their maze: the heart of that god lies beneath this cavern, under the mountain.”

Gods, how large was the Red Maw? It must be miles long, to reach as far as the river while its heart pulsed beneath their feet. Only the oldest of deities grew so large as to – no, that was a distraction from what truly mattered. The layers of schemes, accumulated over the centuries likes sediment at the bottom of a canal.

The devils did not want this god loose but they had not killed it, or perhaps they had been unable to? Yes, that seemed more likely. So instead they had imprisoned the Red Maw, doing something with the golden aether machine and barring the pillar’s gates so it could not be undone before building a maze over the Red Maw’s heart. A maze full of hungry gods, Tristan thought, who the machine above forced to eat not humans or hollows but only the divine.

“The gods of the shrines are meant to eat away at the Red Maw,” he murmured. “That’s why the devils kept bringing more and more temples over the centuries, they were replacing those that the Red Maw ate to keep the prison functional.”

Francho slowly nodded.

“The Watch has not done the same,” he said. “It would have been impossible to hide moving entire shrines to this island with any regularity and I cannot even conceive how they would achieve such a thing in the first place.”

Not through the way their crew had entered this cavern by, no, and it did seem to be the way the Watch used to get to the Old Fort.

“No,” Tristan slowly said. “They have not, so the prison would weaken over time. But they did start doing something else, after taking the Dominion.”

The trials. The fucking trials. The Watch couldn’t bring in entire shrines and the gods bound to them, so sooner or later the Red Maw would devour all the gods keeping it from spreading – it was older, more powerful. It could afford a war of attrition and that was the nature of this prison, gods slowly starving and clawing at each other. So instead the Watch had looked for a way to bolster the strength of the maze gods, to help them against the Red Maw, and in looking found a loophole in the laws imposed by the aether machine.

The trials were just a way to keep drawing people to the Dominion so enough of them would make it to the second trial and die, keeping the shrine gods strong.

The overly large Watch investment on the island, the seemingly backwards method of recruitment, they were all explained if you stopped looking at the Dominion of Lost Things as trials and instead considered it a prison. The blackcloaks willingly paid in gold and lives every year because otherwise this Red Maw might break the lock on its prison and become a much larger problem – one they must not know how to kill, because if they could have by now they most definitely would have.

“Yearly sacrifices,” Francho softly said. “Keeping the seal strong.”

Tristan’s fingers clenched.

“We cannot reveal this,” he said. “They might well kill us to keep it quiet.”

If the true nature of what took place on the Dominion of Lost Things spread, the consequences would be… Tristan could not quite grasp what the Watch as a whole might suffer, that was too grand a scope for a rat, but at the very least the flow of trial-takers would run dry. Not even pride and tradition would make the infanzones keep feeding their children to some savage old god as they unknowingly had for centuries. Or did the infanzones know? No, it could not have remained a secret if that were true. But if it were only the lords and ladies of the Six, well, that might be a different story.

A conspiracy for another time.

“I will speak not a word,” Francho promised.

Tristan let out a long breath, passing a hand through his hair. He had no fear of that, the old man no more wanted to be dragged out back and shot than he did. Best to change the subject, for lingering on it would only serve to unnerve them.

“It is almost shame you cannot,” Tristan said. “Imagine what a book it would make! The university would surely beg for you to return.”

Francho’s face closed, but not at the mention of the University of Reve. It was the mention of a book that had him looking almost bitter and Tristan hid his interest. For all that the man was free with amusing stories, the professor’s past was still largely opaque to him.

“I suppose it is only fair to say,” the toothless old man sighed, “since we already share so many secrets.”

He shook once, coughing wetly into his hand, and his voice was rough when he spoke.

“I cannot write,” Francho said.

Tristan blinked at the absurdity of the statement. How could the man have come to be a Master at Reve if he could not – oh.

“Your contract,” the thief said.

“I first encountered the Bibliognost when I was a young man, out treasure hunting,” Francho said. “It was flattering when he took an interest in me – you will not have heard of him, I imagine, but he is a god that emerged with the first universities. A deity of scholars and secrets, dwelling in forgotten places of learning.”

“Yet your contract is recent,” Tristan stated.

More than mere months old, by the thief’s reckoning, but certainly not decades as contracting when a young man would have meant.

“I was proud in those days, headstrong,” Francho said. “I did not take his offer, for convinced I was meant for greater things still. And I was not entirely wrong: I was soon one of the youngest Masters the University of Reve ever appointed.”

A pause.

“Only one day I looked around me and realized that I was sixty years old and I had not left a lasting mark on the world,” Francho quietly said. “That I would pass away and Vesper would forget my name.”

“So you sought him out again,” Tristan said.

“I did not go about it foolishly,” Francho told him. “I had precise ambitions: I had been close to finding records of the mythic First Cant, the language from which all other hollow cants in the Trebian Sea are derived, but the ruins that should have led me to a library were defaced. I needed a way to plumb their secrets regardless.”

“To hear the whispers in the stone,” Tristan murmured. “He gave you what you wanted.”

“Time makes no difference to o a god,” Francho said. “It had been decades to me, but to him barely the blink of an eye. The Bibliognost offered me his power, and though the price for what I asked was steep it was not unfair.”

“He took your ability to write,” the thief said.

“That was the price,” Francho said, then he grimaced. “Or so I thought. I had planned to get around the restriction by making a student write in my stead, which would have been eccentric but not so much that Reve would object. Only when I began to dictate my words to the student, she found she could not write them.”

He chuckled bitterly.

“Like trying to hold smoke, she described it,” Francho said. “And that was when I realized that I had not given away my ability to write, Tristan: I had given the Bibliognost ‘everything I might ever write’.”

Oh, Tristan softly thought. A god of scholars and secrets, Francho had called the entity. Fortuna was the Lady of Long Odds, the one in a thousand chance, and it was such gambles she fed on – win or lose. The Bibliognost had fed on the old professor’s scholarship and through cunning phrasing also made everything Francho might learn through his contract secrets for him savor. If what Francho learned could not be writ down, in a matter of decades it would be good as forgot.

Not all gods offered such plain bargains as the one had struck with Fortuna: some saw their contractors as little more than the spoon filling their mouth.

“Yes,” Francho said. “I was tricked.”

“They sent you away from the university for it?” Tristan asked.

A professor that could not write or be written for was hardly fit to teach students.

“They were not going to throw me out,” the old man snorted. “I was as familiar to my fellows as the bricks or the fountains, just as much a part of Reve. But I was to lose my Master’s chair and cease giving classes.”

He paused.

“I could not stand it,” Francho admitted. “Being tricked and losing so much, when I had thought myself cleverer than a god. So I turned to the Caliginum, the library beneath Reve, and stole forbidden books so that I might find a way to break free of the price.”

“You said it was a disagreement with rectoress that made you leave the university,” Tristan recalled.

Francho smiled toothlessly.

“I got close,” he said. “I could push it onto rabbits, but they never survived the process. I needed a larger brain, I knew, capable of higher thought. Of true interaction with the aether. And there are always students desperate for tutoring so their marks will not get them thrown out.”

Tristan went still.

“You did it to a student?”

“They found the books in my room before I could,” Francho said.

He smiled mirthlessly.

“Or so the rectoress told the infanzones, when she declared me a wanted man,” he said. “In truth they were an hour late.”

The thief breathed in sharply.

“It did not work,” Francho conversationally said. “The boy’s own brain bled him to death.”

So that was why the man was not some tutor ensconced in a noble house, teaching their children. He was a killer and a wanted man. Francho reached for another cabecita, broke it on his lip and sucked in the piece. He swallowed, wetly.

“Are you disappointed, Tristan?” the old man lightly asked. “That I am not the kind of man I like to seem.”

Francho’s face was unmarred by shame or doubt. He did not, the thief decided, regret what he had done. Even if it had failed. The old professor had decided that he was willing to kill for a chance at cheating the price of his contract, at gaining back all that he had lost. Maybe if Tristan were from the Old Town he would have been disgusted, but he was a rat. He knew better. Francho had been starved, so he had bit. That the boy he’d bit had been underserving changed nothing. When had the world ever run on what people deserved?

You bit what your teeth could reach, nothing more and nothing less.

“I suppose I do have a question,” Tristan said.

“Oh?” Francho said. “By all means, ask.”

The thief cocked his head to the side.

“Did you find it?” he asked. “The First Cant you were looking for.”

Francho went still as stone, looking at him for a long time, then convulsed. Tristan thought him to be coughing or crying, until the bitterest laugh he had ever heard came crawling out.

“There was misspelling on the stele,” Francho told him. “It was supposed to be speaking of the library in a past tense, you see.”

The old man toothlessly smiled.

“It was torn down millennia ago to make room for a brothel, so there were nothing at all left to find.”

He laughed again but Tristan could not help but hear the wail behind it. The whimper. He left the professor sitting alone, wrestling with his grief, and did not look back.

He had his own ghosts to lay to rest and no time for anyone else’s.

—

The rope ladder up into the pillar wasn’t guarded.

Why would it be, when as far as Lieutenant Vasanti knew the sole room there led to a door she had the only key to? Sloppy, the thief thought disapprovingly. In their place he would have left a watchman up there and had them pull the ladder up until morning. Vasanti’s imprudence was his gain as he snuck out of the Old Fort and climbed back up to the same room he had been so glad to be rid of earlier. In Tristan’s pocket waited the stone button he had lent to Francho, but he did not use it yet. Instead he leaned back against the wall by the stone door and met Fortuna’s golden eyes.

She rolled them but went ahead anyway.

The goddess could not stray far from him, but walls and locks meant nothing to her. She was not physically present, after all, only the illusion of her in his eyes. It was twenty seconds before she returned, popping her head through the still-closed door.

“He’s not in there,” Fortuna told him.

“I will need you to look ahead in the hallway as well,” Tristan murmured. “But remember we cannot talk. He could be sensitive to sound.”

She cocked an eyebrow at him, a somewhat distressing sight when all he saw of her was a seemingly floating head and loose blond locks. She was, he mused as his fingers closed against the stone button, definitely doing that on purpose.

“I am perfectly capable of silence,” she said. “It is your own incessant chatter that-”

He pressed the button into the opening, cutting her off by the act of the door popping open – he slid around it to catch the button as it fell out of the ‘lock’ on the other side. Fortuna looked more than slightly offended, which only got worse when he put his finger to his lips in a smiling shush. The lights were back in the tile room, Tristan saw, but he did not linger there. Leaving the door ajar, he crept back up the way he had first come into this room: the maintenance door. The room there was exactly as he had left it, so the thief helped himself to the first reason he had returned.

The last stone button went into his pocket and then he took the brand Vasanti was so hungry for.

Now for the second reason. He doubled back towards the door with the broken latch, the one leading out into the hallway, and met Fortuna’s eyes. She went through as he prepared to bolt, but returned with a shake of her head. The god was not there, at least for the moment. Why did it leave? Did gods sleep? He had not thought so. Still, for now he would count his blessings and proceed down the hallway with all the quiet he had learned. The door was still there, hidden by the curve of the hall, and two dozen steps took him to it. Green glass, but transparent enough he could see through it.

And as he’d thought when getting his first glimpse from a distance, what he saw through that door was a lift.

—

Tristan fled after that, not slowing until he the stone door closed behind him and he had a semblance of safety. Brand still in hand, stones in his pocket, the thief went to the edge of the room and finally allowed himself to rest. He sat at the edge, feet dangling in the void as the distant sight of the maze of ruins – from here little more than slices of antiquity bared by light, as if some ancient era had been left half-used on a cutting board – and his breathing evened out.

Tristan Abrascal sat there in silence and thought, for now he saw the whole of the mosaic.

Now all that was left was to decide where to slide the knife.

# Chapter 29

To her very great shame, Angharad’s first reaction was relief it had not been one of hers.

The second was fury: Aines’ corpse could not have been left out of the hall by accident, the murderer had wanted them all to see it. She strode over to the crowd, only some of them turning at the sound: the rest were too busy shouting. Lord Ishaan was the first to notice her and the man – still chubby-cheeked, for all that the fresh scar across his lip now lent him a harder edge – turned red as an apple.

“Lady Angharad,” he got out. “Would you, I mean-”

Shalini leaned over his shoulder, glance flicking up and down, then let out an approving noise.

“He’s asking you to put pants on,” she translated. “Respectfully.”

Angharad frowned. Her underclothes ended high on her thighs, but she was hardly naked.

“This is why people make sport of Ramayans, Nair,” Tupoc Xical opined, stepping out. “You can’t take a gift even when it’s dropped straight onto your lap.”

Tupoc’s gaze was hardly the most lascivious Angharad had ever been on the receiving end of – she’d had worse leers stretching out in sparring clothes after getting sweaty – but the pale eyes were distinctly appreciative as they took her in. That and the attention the conversation was drawing from those who had been shouting was enough to convince Angharad to give in to Ishaan’s request.

She could think of few things more nauseating than arguing about clothing besides a murder victim’s corpse.

Doubling back to her chambers, she dragged on pants and boots before hastily belting her saber. Grabbing her coat as well, she came out with outstretched arms only to pause right out the door. Yong was there, bangs loose despite the haircut the kindly old lady had given him after he lost his topknot. So was Song, smiling pressing a pistol against his belly. To the older Tianxi’s honor, he did not seem particularly fearful of that. Instead he nodded Angharad’s way, ignoring he was but a twitch of the finger away from a shot in the guts.

“Tredegar,” he said. “A word in private, please.”

Angharad almost sighed, pulling her coat into place by tugging the lapels.

“That’s not happening,” Song said. “I know who you are, Jiang Shashou Yong.”

Some kind of Cathayan title? Yong hardly seemed a noble and the Republics should not have any besides.

“I do not recall seeing the young lady at Diecai, so I assure you she is quite safe,” Yong drily said.

Angharad’s eyes narrowed, irritated at being cut out a conversation that had begun with a request of her.

“That is enough, Song,” she said, pushing down the muzzle of the pistol. “I can decide for myself who I will speak to, in private or not.”

Her friend grimaced.

“Angharad, he is-”

“Whatever those words in Cathayan you appended to his name mean, I imagine,” she cut in. “I do not care. That does not place the decision in your hands.”

Diecai. The name was vaguely known to her. A battle a few decades back, perhaps a Republican victory? Angharad would admit to not having been the most dutiful of students when it came to the history of Tianxia and the Someshwar. There were only so many times you could hear of ten thousand soldiers dying to move a border by two miles before it all rather melded together. Her eyes moved to Yong.

“Meanwhile, Master Yong, we are largely unacquainted and there was recently a murder,” she said. “We will not be going anywhere alone. The three of us, however, can take a moment inside my chambers to have the conversation you requested.”

Song murmured something in Cathayan, the other Tianxi’s eyes snapping to her as he replied acidly in the same, and Angharad’s thinning patience snapped.

“You are both being intolerably rude,” she coldly said. “Mend your manners or leave.”

 Song grimaced, nodding an apology, but Yong looked unmoved.

“Shall we go into your room?”

Angharad had half a mind to send him away, but that was anger speaking and not sense. She stepped back and invited them in, though she did not close the door. By the time both were inside, Song’s pistol was nowhere to be seen.

“You wanted to speak to me,” Angharad reminded the man. “Here I am.”

Yong hesitated a moment, then made his decision.

“A friend of mine found out that Aines and Felis were both sent here by the same coterie,” he said. “It paid for their seats on the Bluebell.”

The Pereduri cocked an eyebrow.

“Coterie?”

“Gang,” Song clarified. “Sacromonte has more than a dog has fleas. Some grow distressingly large and influential.”

The sign of a decaying state whose nobility improperly discharged their duties. Such a thing would never have been tolerated in Peredur: souls committed to infamy did not stay in the duchy, they fled abroad to become pirates and hirelings. There would be time to consider the failings of Sacromonte later, however.

“Why would criminals pay to send a married couple onto this dangerous island?” Angharad asked.

“For bets,” Yong said. “They are called ‘red games’. The desperate are indebted are sent here and told to accomplish a task in exchange for salvation.”

Oh, the noblewoman did not like the sound of that. The conclusion was obvious as it was ugly.

“Felis was told to kill his wife?” she said, appalled.

The Tianxi wiggled his hand.

“I do not know for sure,” he said. “But he tried to get her to leave our crew several times during the Trial of Lines and Aines told us that should she die before reaching the third trial there would be dire consequences.”

“For whom?” Angharad asked.

“They have children, I hear,” Song quietly said.

The older man nodded.

“The coteries, they do not care about the deaths,” he said. “Death is cheap. What they care about is the surprise, the story. If they told Aines she must live until the third trial or her children would die, then Felis…”

“Might have been told the opposite,” Angharad said. “So they might find out who would turn on the other first.”

Her jaw clenched, teeth grinding. A disgusting abuse of power, fit only to be answered by the blade.

“You believe Felis did it, then,” she said.

“I do not know,” Yong admitted. “But he had means – they slept in the same room – and motive. It looks much like Ju’s murder, which I doubt he had anything to do with, but that might be the point.”

Song was more interested in something else.

“Why go to us with this?” she asked. “You came here with the Ramayan crew.”

The older Tianxi glanced at her with irritation, and for a moment Angharad thought they would start bickering again. Instead he shrugged.

“Ishaan’s a decent sort, for a Someshwari, but he will only go so far with this,” Yong said. “I do not believe you will drop the matter even if it becomes messy.”

It was true that Aines had not been part of Ishaan’s crew and so he had no obligation to her as a lord, but Angharad thought the young lord was being underestimated. She had no reason to believe the Someshwari so lacking in character as to allow a murder to go unpunished, but then Yong was Tianxi. He would have little understanding of nobility and its duties.

“Twice now one of us was murdered in cold blood,” Angharad said. “Heedless of… messiness, as you put it, we must rid ourselves of this curse before it strikes again.”

The Tianxi gave her a nod, satisfied with the implicit promise. He had nothing more to tell them so after barely passable leavetaking he took the door. Angharad would have followed, had Song not laid a restraining hand on her arm.

“There’s something off about the body,” she said.

Aines’, she no doubt meant. Angharad raised an eyebrow.

“How so?”

“The throat was cut, but the spray of blood was minimal,” Song said. “Either the body was cleaned up or-”

“Aines was killed before her throat was cut,” Angharad finished.

She had made enough corpses to know the difference.

“That was not the case with the twin’s death,” she continued after a moment. “There was a great deal of blood on the grass.”

“Ju was definitely killed while alive,” Song agreed. “Which begs the question of why it was different this time, if it was the same killer’s work.”

“So Felis killed his wife without leaving a mark, then cut her throat to have the first murderer blamed for it,” Angharad frowned.

A pause.

“It could be the other way around,” she pointed out. “The killer could have made this death different to send us chasing after the wrong man.”

Though Angharad had never thought of such a thing being associated to murder before, stratagems of that kind were not uncommon at court. Song conceded with a nod.

“We won’t learn anything more in here, anyhow,” the Tianxi said. “Best to return before the others get impatient.”

—

The stepped right into a tinderbox.

Around Aines’ cooling corpse every soul in the temple had gathered, in varying degrees of dress but with every single soul armed. There were half a dozen pistols out and just as many blades, and though none were being pointed yet they were being waved about with too much enthusiasm for Angharad’s tastes. Lines were being drawn, groups coalescing. Lord Ishaan, Shalini and Acanthe were pressing Tupoc, by whom a sneering Ocotlan stood. The object of the argument was Felis, who had hunched on himself looking like a beaten dog.  

“They slept in the same bed,” Ishaan insisted. “You would have me believe he did not wake up even as she was dragged out of the room?”

“Drugs or a contract would see to that easily enough,” Tupoc shrugged. “I am more interested in what Lan was doing, awake so early and walking about.”

The surviving Tianxi twin looked nervous, but she was not alone. Lady Ferranda, Brun and even Yong stood with her. It was Brun, the fair-haired Sacromontan even-tempered as ever, who replied.

“Are you suggesting she also murdered her own sister?” Brun asked.

Tupoc shrugged, but there were few takers for the notion in the crowd. All remembered Lan’s grief that morning.

“Besides,” Brun continued, “Lady Ferranda was the first out the door after Lan shouted and she saw nothing worth calling attention to.”

“One of us would have found the corpse eventually,” Ferranda Villazur agreed. “That it was Lan makes no difference.”

“I cannot agree,” Lord Remund flatly said. “I notice you are fully dressed, Ferranda. Are you telling me you achieved this in mere moments before running out? It is most suspicious.”

Ferranda’s lips thinned. She did not answer.

“I am sure she has an explanation for that,” Lady Isabel said, once again playing peacemaker. “Let us not accuse in haste, Remund.”

Master Cozme stood with the two infanzones, closing off their faction. Unlike the two nobles the mustachioed soldier looked unwilling to step into the argument, but he was armed and watchful. His eyes were seeking something, Angharad realized, or at least someone. A heartbeat later she realized whom.

“Where are Lord Zenzele and Yaretzi?” the noblewoman called out, stepping in with Song at her side.

“Ah, Lady Tredegar finally graces us with her presence,” Tupoc called out. “A belated welcome to you.”

“You talk a lot, for someone with so little to say,” Shalini Goel mildly said.

The same Someshwari then glanced Angharad’s way.

“Both of them rushed in when everyone was there,” Shalini said, “but they must have slipped away after.”

Murmurs spread.

“Suspicious,” Remund said.

“Can it even be called an echo if you only repeat your own voice, Cerdan?” Yong mocked.

There were more laughs than she would have expected to that, and several who smiled. Remund’s cheeks reddened with anger, but Cozme kept him from answering as he clearly wished to.

“Enough,” Angharad stepped in. “We cannot get to the bottom of this until everyone is here. Did anyone see which way they went?”

A lot of muttering, but no answer.

“Then we will have to look for them level by level,” Angharad said. “Moving in pairs for safety.”

“That won’t be necessary.”

She recognized Lord Zenzele’s voice even before the man himself came into view, a steel-faced Yaretzi at his side. They were coming down the stairs that led to the upper level and Angharad’s stomach clenched. Neither looked as if they were bearing good news.

“We went to have a look at the gates upstairs,” Yaretzi explained.

The reigning current of curiosity ensured they were allowed to speak instead of questioned.

“Someone took a hammer to two of the three,” Lord Zenzele told everyone. “Their needles no longer turn and the mechanisms are damaged: I expect only the gate slated for the seventh hour will be fit to open.”

We are being forced to stick together, Angharad thought. Why? Should the murdered not prefer for the crews to split off again as quickly as possible, to hide from retribution?

“I know of only one hammer around here,” Song noted. “Ocotlan?”

The big man snorted.

“Like any of you twigs could swing it,” the Aztlan said. “It was in my rooms when the racket woke me up, so it hasn’t been stolen.”

“Then we ought to look through everyone’s bags for a hammer,” Lord Ishaan suggested.

“Agreed,” Angharad forcefully said.

Some hesitation from the crowd, but willingness as well. No one wanted the murderer to walk free.

“A bloodied knife was planted in my valet’s affairs, last time,” Lord Remund cautioned them. “Let us not assume a hammer means culpability, it could have been place there.”

“Sounds like something a man with a hammer in his bag might say,” Tupoc grinned.

That saw an end to all argument from a freshly red-cheeked Remund. It was longer and more arduous to arrange who would look through the bags than look through them. In the end three of them – Angharad, Ishaan, Tupoc – were deputized to act. The two captains of the crew the bag’s owner were not part of did the looking, with some effort made as to discretion. As much as they could while doing this in the hallway with everyone looking, anyhow. A quick but methodical search that could not have lasted more than ten minutes revealed no hammer.

“It could be hidden in the killer’s room,” Brun suggested. “We can search those as well.”

“I would have been simpler to just throw it in one of the pools downstairs when they were done,” Acanthe Phos opined. “And I don’t think anyone wants to go looking through that strange water.”

There were grimaces at that, but no one contradicted her. All had been careful not to come into direct contact with the iridescent waters in the pools and waterfalls below.

“Then we must look for the murderer with wits and witnesses,” Angharad said. “Question all those who might have seen something.”

“This is not Malan, Lady Angharad, and we are not your peasants,” Shalini Goel bluntly said. “No one here is bound to abide by your judgement.”

“Afraid of questions, Someshwari?” Lord Remund sneered. “Lady Angharad has proved honorable, unlike you lot.”

She his her surprise at the unstinting defense, though part of her did wonder if it was merely a springboard to strike at his opponents from.

“Her honor is not in question,” Lord Ishaan mildly replied. “It seems wiser, however, for more than one person to investigate this affair.”

“Lord Ishaan is entirely correct,” she said. “I did not mean to imply otherwise.”

Angharad had expected relatively straightforward acclamations, as for the bags, but to her surprise it was not the case. Few supported Tupoc – only Ocotlan and Felis – while Ishaan similarly struggled to earn support from his crew. Brun and Lady Ferranda instead pushed for Yong, surprisingly supported by Lan. The sudden sundering of authority made no sense to her, until the argument led her to watching Zenzele as he argued for himself as an investigator.

The gate, it was all because of the gate.

There was only one to take, so like it or not everyone would be going the same way and sharing the same path. The previous captaincies were meaningless because everyone would tread the same ground anyway, so now everyone pressed for those they liked or trusted the most instead of their once-captain. Is that what the murderer wanted? Forcing everyone to go through a single gate, one that was to open within hours, had resulted in the effective end of the delving crews.

Worse, we all know there is only so long left until the seventh hour, she thought. When the gate did open at that time, they would have to take it whether the murderer was found or not. They would, otherwise, be stuck in this temple with the killer for another night or day. It was devil’s cleverness at work, but cleverness nonetheless and it gave them trouble.

Angharad was acclaimed into a investigator’s role by six voices within moments of it becoming, then Yong by maintaining his four and then to her surprise Tupoc won over Lord Ishaan when Yaretzi spoke for him over the other man.  To have neither Yaretzi nor Zenzele’s voice as part of her count when she did have Acanthe Phos’ was something that left her rather unsettled. Song leaned in close.

“They both voted late, after you were guaranteed to have be one of the victors,” Song reassured her. “The point was to pick more than one candidate, not express distrust in you.”

Angharad did not know what she liked less about this: that the pair had not truly sent support where they thought it most deserving or that Song thought this to be some kind of… democratic process. Worse was that she was not entirely sure the silver-eyed Tianxia was wrong. Setting aside her discomfort, she held council with Yong and Tupoc. The three agreed that everyone should return to their rooms until the questioning was finished and that though there was a right to question violence was strictly forbidden – despite Tupoc’s protests.

“You would have us dig a pit without shovel,” the Aztlan complained.

“I will not entrust you with authority I believe you will abuse,” Angharad frostily.

“I just think you’re the worst kind of prick,” Yong confessed. “But sure, what she said.”

Tupoc laughed. She decided to believe that Yong was being facetious, for both their sakes. Angharad’s first act was to ask the other two if they had any questions for Song and, when told this was not the case, claiming her as a right hand for the rest of the investigation and fetching her from her room. Tupoc followed suit with Ocotlan, but Yong preferred going at it alone. Having no intention to stay together for the interrogations, they split up and go to work after together laying Aines to rest on the stone bed in one of the empty rooms.

Within moments Angharad stood alone with her Tianxi friend, breathing in deeply.

“Lan was the first to see the corpse,” Song said. “She seems the logical place to start.”

The noblewoman saw no reason to disagree. They were the first to go to the twin, who was waiting calmly in her room.

“Lady Angharad, Song Ren,” Lan said, nodding a greeting. “I’d wondered if it would be you two or Tupoc first.”

The Pereduri nodded a greeting back but kept the courtesies brief.

“You found the body,” Angharad said. “Tell me about it.”

“It was dead,” Lan drily replied.

The Pereduri twitched at the flippancy.

“Was it cold?” Song asked.

The other woman shrugged.

“I did not touch it,” she said, “so I cannot say.”

“What were you doing out in the first place?” Song asked.

“I was going to take a piss,” Lan frankly said. “Almost did anyway, stumbling onto Aines like that.”

Angharad’s eyes narrowed. The crudity of the answer was distasteful, but it was too distasteful. It felt like the girl she had dueled last year at Mawa Peak who had kept striking at her face – Angharad’s form had been better, they both knew, so her opponent had tried to make her lose her temper to bring them back on even ground.

“You are,” Angharad coldly said, “lying.”

Song idly produced her pistol, which Lan’s eyes followed warily. Though Angharad almost told her to put it away, the implication of violence was not strictly against the promise made – only the actual exercise.

“That’s a bluff,” the twin snorted. “No way you agreed on giving each other that authority.”

“We voted on it,” Angharad stiffly said.

She felt the blue-lipped woman’s eyes on her as she spoke, Lan eventually letting out a small curse in Antigua. She bit her lip, then raised her hands.

“Fine,” she said. “You got me. I wasn’t coming out of my room at all, because I never went into it.”

Angharad blinked, taken aback.

“Why?”

Song breathed in.

“You spent the entire night spying on everyone’s movements,” the Tianxi said. “To see who went where.”

Lan grinned, unrepentant.

“It’s always useful to know who’s fucking and scheming with who,” the blue-lipped woman said. “And it’s not like I was doing anything forbidden, is it? I just waited in a dark corner with a good view and waited, that’s not even snooping the way most people would see it.”

Wait, if she had been keeping an eye on everyone’s coming and goings then… Angharad coughed into her fist, embarrassed.

“Yeah, my lady, your cheeks should be red,” Lan cackled. “That girl’s good as engaged, the way Remund Cerdan tells it.”

“Angharad?”

The noblewoman found Song’s silver eyes on her, face unreadable.

“It was not,” she tried, then swallowed. “We didn’t. I declined, given the circumstances.”

“But she attempted to sleep with you,” Song slowly said.

“We are straying off the subject,” Angharad stiffly replied.

The Tianxi must have taken it as a confirmation, for her face tightened. For a moment Angharad though she saw anger in the cast of the other woman’s face, but surely that was only the light. She had never been given the slightest hint that Song might be interested in her or that they thought of each other in such a light, so what call was there for jealous anger? Salvation came from an unexpected source.

“Poor Isabel,” Lan mused. “She must have been wanting a pick-me up after her other visit.”

That got both their attentions.

“Other visit?” Angharad asked.

“Remund Cerdan came to her room,” the blue-lipped woman said. “Stayed in there about a quarter hour, left looking angry and went straight to back to his own.”

Song hummed, looking interested.

“Trouble in Sacromonte, perhaps,” she said. “Who else wandered, Lan?”

“Ah, and now you even call me by my name all sweetly,” the other woman smiled. “Funny how even a rat gets a smile when they have the right dirt – it’s almost as if the world runs on secrets.”

“It may help us find out who the killer was to know who moved around during the night,” Angharad honestly told her. “I would ask that you tell us.”

The twin sighed.

“Fine, fine,” she dismissed. “Shalini went to Lord Ishaan’s room, and I didn’t need my ear against that door to guess why. Stayed for about two hours, then back to her own. Just a little after that, Ferranda Villazur came out of her own fully dressed and went upstairs.”

Angharad stilled. They were all on the fourth level, and the fifth held little save the room with the gates.

“Did she have a hammer?” she asked.

“She wore a cloak so I can’t say,” Lan told them. “She was gone for an hour at most, then back to her room.”

Angharad worried her lip.

“And after that?” Song asked.

“After that I fell asleep,” Lan admitted. “When I woke up I wasn’t sure about the time, so I headed to my room to grab some sleep. I ran into Aines’ corpse on the way and you know what follows.”

She closed her eyes, trying to fit the pieces.

“How long Lady Isabel stay in my quarters?” she asked.

“Go there around the eleventh hour, left around the first,” Lan said.

“Shalini’s visit?”

“From midnight to the second hour, more or less,” she replied.

After which Lady Ferrand had gone upstairs for an hour then come back down.

“It’s a quarter past five at the moment,” Song noted. “And it should not have been much more than half an hour since this all began.”

So Lan found the body a quarter before the fifth hour, more or less, and before that there were a little under two hours through which the twin had slept. The last person known to have stalked the halls was, it appeared, Lady Ferranda. That made it plain who Angharad’s next visit needed to be.

“Thank you for your help,” she told Lan.

The Tianxi grinned, revealing teeth stained just as blue as her lips.

“If you catch them, try not to kill them,” Lan said. “I have a debt to settle first.”

—

Angharad not often spoken with Lady Ferranda Villazur since the Trial of Ruins had begun, something she occasionally felt a sliver of guilt over. Now was not the time to indulge in that guilt, however, so when she and Song entered the room she kept her face blank. Ferranda, still fully dressed and her bun pulled tight, sat on her bed.  The greetings exchanged were stiff, so Angharad decided not to stretch out the shared discomfort.

“You were seen going upstairs during the night,” she told the infanzona. “May I know why?”

The fair-haired Sacromontan studied her a moment, frowning.

“Lan or Brun,” she finally said. “Everyone else would have thought it beneath them to spy.”

Brun was not much of a snoop, Angharad thought, so there Ferranda misread the situation. Either way, she had no intention of revealing Lan’s tactlessness – for another to be indiscreet was no excuse to follow their example.

“Interesting insight,” Song said. “Not, however, an answer to our question.”

Ferranda sighed.

“I went upstairs,” she said, “so I could take a hammer to two of the three paths.”

There was a short, awkward pause as Angharad admitted to herself she had not expected so blunt and easy a confession. Song seemed similarly taken aback.

“To what purpose?” she finally asked.

Ferranda straightened.

“I am told that Lady Isabel passed a trial as part of your crew while displaying obvious foreknowledge.”

“And you have foreknowledge of your own,” Angharad said, unwilling to leave it unsaid.

“Not our own,” the infanzona admitted. “House Villazur bought it from a house better informed. Among that knowledge was a thorough description of this very temple and of where the three ‘gates’ lead. It is one of the few fixed points in the maze.”

“And what makes the gate so important?” Angharad asked.

“One of those I broke leads into a trap, a hallway whose floor rises to meet the ceiling,” Ferranda said, and the Pereduri winced. “The second leads back to another crossroads, spreading in every direction.”

She paused.

“The one I spared should lead to a temple-fortress overlooking the very last stretch of the maze: a passage called the Toll Road.”

Song stirred from her place leaning against the wall, earning a curious look from the other two.

“I have heard the name before,” she said. “I was told it leads directly to the gate where the ten victors must stand.”

“You could have shared your knowledge with others instead of wielding a hammer,” Angharad said, turning to the other noble, though the reproach in her voice was mild.

Knowing that Ferranda had not acted with the intent to harm rather robbed her of any genuine offence at the act.

“I did,” Lady Ferranda said. “Lord Ishaan then requested I keep the information secret.”

Angharad’s jaw tightened.

“The gate to the death trap,” she began, “who-”

“Tupoc’s group,” the infanzona cut in. “And while I do not disagree the man deserves to die, he would not have died alone.”

And so Ferranda Villazur had acted within the bounds of honor: she had not gone against the word of the captain she had gone under, but neither had she allowed those she deemed unworthy of death to approach it unknowing. Angharad nodded in respect, which had Ferranda’s plain face twisting in surprise. Song cleared her throat.

“I mean no slight to your honor,” the Tianxi said, “but should we want to verify your words…”

“I do not image Lord Ishaan will deny them if asked,” the infanzona shrugged.

“The hammer you used?” Song pressed again.

“I tossed it one of the pools downstairs,” Ferranda amusedly said. “Much as Lady Acanthe guessed. It is the one besides the twisted gargoyle with dragon’s claws, if you are inclined to look.”

Angharad cleared her throat.

“And the reason why you remained dressed?”

“In case this all went bad,” Lady Ferranda frankly said. “Should my actions be found out while I slept, I did not want to be caught in my underclothes and so I slept fully dressed. My affairs are also all packed.”

A look behind them was enough to bear that out: the room was pristine, the bags orderly. Song, though was not yet satisfied.

“Why destroy two of the gates?” she asked. “Only one was truly harmful.”

“Because I want this godforsaken trial to end, Tianxi,” the infanzona harshly said. “Once we have all found the Toll Road it will only be a matter of days until this all over.”

“Then-”

“Enough,” Angharad said, cutting off Song.

She inclined her head at Lady Ferranda.

“Thank you for your answers.”

“Think nothing of it,” the infanzona dismissed.

Her Tianxi right hand did not need to be dragged out of the room, saving them both the embarrassment. Angharad turned on her after the door closed behind them.

“That was unnecessary,” she flatly said.

Song shook her head.

“She was lying.”

A pause.

“You believe she is the murderer?” Angharad tried.

“No,” Song admitted. “But she was lying about why she sabotaged two of the gates instead of one, I am sure of it. She is hiding something.”

The Pereduri grit her teeth in frustration – at both the insistence that Song should have been allowed to continue her rudeness and that perhaps the insistence was not entirely unwarranted.

“We are all hiding things, Song,” she finally said.

“Maybe,” the Tianxi said, unconvinced. “But mark my words, Angharad: there were games afoot tonight, and the one that made a corpse might not even have been the most dangerous.”

—

Their third destination must, inevitably, be Felis.

Though Angharad was uncertain of his guilt, Yong’s words could not be denied: the man had had both motive and opportunity. Only when the pair reached his room there was already someone standing by them. Tupoc stood by the open door, smiling as they arrived. Beyond the threshold Ocotlan seemed to be speaking with Felis.

“We require a word with him,” Angharad told him.

“Oh?” he drawled. “What for?”

Already the man was trying her patience. Deciding on boldness, Angharad went for the throat. 

“We have reason to believe he was bribed to kill his wife,” she said.

A moment passed. For a man whose follower had just been implicitly accused of murder, Tupoc Xical seemed most unshaken.

“You are correct,” Tupoc easily said. “Felis was told that if he slew his wife before the third trial, their children would be raised wealthy.”

Angharad paused, taken aback again. Villains in plays were much harder to unmask. The Izcalli then raised a finger.

“The condition, however, was that he must do it with his own hands,” Tupoc continued. “Look at the him now, Tredegar.

Angharad did. Worn and bruised, Felis looked hunched on himself even though Ocotlan was looking unusually mild. He also kept glancing at the corners of the room, gnawing at his lips. Guilt? No, mostly he looked worried. Not even all that afraid, but anxious about something past the horizon.

“Does he look like someone who just got his way?” Tupoc asked.

The Pereduri’s lips thinned.

“No,” she admitted nonetheless.

“He’ll be scheming to see if he can claim he did the deed to his patrons anyhow,” the pale-eyed Aztlan said. “But the man is scavenger, nothing more. He does not have the spine or competence to have done this, much less the first murder.”

Song cleared her throat.

“And this tale you told us of what the coterie demanded of him,” she said. “How do you know it?”

“I had Ocotlan hang him upside down while I asked questions,” Tupoc said.

Angharad looked at him aghast. The man put a hand over his heart, a beaming smile on his face.

“Come now, I am no monster,” Tupoc said. “I did wait until his wife was out of the room, Lady Angharad. He’d still had a fair shot at murdering her down the line.”

Her jaw clenched, fingers tightened around the grip of her blade. His spear was not yet assembled. It was a dishonor to strike the unarmed, but if she could find a reason…

“We will not fall for your provocations,” Song evenly said. “You can cease trying.”

Angharad, who had about to fall for the provocations, mastered herself with some effort. Now was not the time or place for Tupoc to learn that crime unerringly earned punishment.

“Felis is not so much a suspect as first believed,” she said through gritted teeth.

“We are in agreement, then,” Tupoc said. “I am impressed with this killer, truth be told. This is subtler than when they framed Tristan for the twin: they had to learn about the red games, not simply observe a brawl.”

Angharad paused.

“You did not believe Tristan to be the killer,” she slowly said.

“Of course not,” Tupoc said.

He seemed surprised at the words.

“You accused him repeatedly, Tical. Led the charge to see him blamed.”

“Because I wanted him to die,” the Aztlan told her, as if she were a little slow.

Angharad’s saber made it halfway out of the scabbard before Song caught her wrist.

“Not here,” she said. “Not now.”

And Tupoc, Tupoc was grinning. Already he was reaching for his segmented spear, putting the first two parts together.

“Why?” Angharad demanded. “What possible reason could you have had to try to get an innocent man killed?”

“Something about him offends my god,” Tupoc shrugged. “I am told he feels like someone who should have died a hundred times over, that it is most disorderly.”

Song forced the sword back in the scabbard and Angharad let her. They were still under truce, she reminded herself. However thin a truce it might be.

“I require words with Felis,” she coldly said. “Immediately.”

“So demanding,” Tupoc said, fanning himself.

But he did call for Ocotlan, whose rose to his feet. The big man with the broken nose tried to brush into her as he passed, but Angharad squared her feet – her shoulder bone dug in the soft of his own shoulder, the Aztlan drawing away with a pained growl. Angharad stared him down until he looked away, leaving with a still-smiling Tupoc.

“Ishaan might have had a point,” Song murmured.

A jest, no doubt, but not one she was in a mood to humor. She did not answer, striding in instead, and before she could so much as offer a greeting Felis began to babble.

“I didn’t do it,” he swore. “I was still sleeping when all the shouting began, just ask Lan, and-”

“Tell us of your evening before,” Song cut in.

The longer they spoke with the man, the clearer it became he had little to say. He had gone to sleep early and woken up only when Lan found his wife’s body. They had shared a room but not a bedroll, and Angharad could help but find that for someone with so little to relay the man seemed all too nervous.

“May I have a look at your wound?” she suddenly asked.

Felis stilled.

“Why?”

Discomfort, Angharad thought. One of the secrets being kept.

“It will be easier to ascertain if you could have killed your wife at all given the state of your wound,” Song smoothly replied.

Felis on begrudgingly agreed, opening his shirt and tugging down mostly clean bandages to show where Remund had stabbed him in the belly. Angharad knelt, frowning as she saw the wound was mostly closed. No, not closed. The red of the gash was not that of healed flesh but of something else – blood-red, sanguine, but not blood. Carefully touching around the wound with the tip of her fingers as Felis hissed in exaggerated pain, she found that the flesh was stiff. Solid, almost like as if there were bone beneath it. Frowning, Angharad drew away and back to her feet.

“See?” Felis said. “I couldn’t have done it.”

A lie. Whatever that blood-red material was, it had effectively closed the wound. The noblewoman expected skin would grow back over it in time, leaving only that patch of solid skin.

“We are finished here,” Angharad finally said.

“Agreed,” Song said.

And the other woman’s tone was as grim as her own thoughts, for they had grasped the very same problem: for all they had learned, they still had no real idea who’d murdered Aines.

—

Yong was waiting in the hall when she emerged, looking in no better mood than she.

“How is the wound?” the Tianxi asked.

“Good as healed,” Angharad replied.

The Tianxi sighed, passing a hand through his freshly-cut bangs.

“Dead ends for me,” Yong said. “I heard about the nightly visits from Lan, but Remund Cerdan insists he only went over to speak of his upcoming engagement and Ruesta agreed.”

Angharad readied herself for embarrassing questions, but none came. Was he not going to ask about Isabels’ visit to her own rooms?

“Did you get anything out Lady Ferranda?” Song asked, filling the silence before it could grow too noticeable.

“That she was saving poor lambs, benevolent mistress that she is,” Yong drily said. “Villazur was done with our crew and decided her way out was forcing us all down the same path, I’m guessing.”

An uncharitable interpretation, but Angharad supposed Ferranda could have been moved to act for more than one reason.

“A span of two hours with no witness is too long,” Song noted. “There is no solid way to catch out the culprit with such a glaring hole in our knowledge.”

“My thoughts exactly,” Yong said. “Any idea why Xical went straight for Felis from the start? If anyone should know everything the man has to say, it’s him.”

Angharad paused.

“He has sought out no one save Felis for questioning?” she asked.

“Lan, but only moments and after me,” Yong replied.

That seemed… odd. As did the fact that he did not seem to be interrogating anyone currently. What was the Izcalli after? Angharad let Song inform the other Tianxi that they had no idea what Tupoc had asked about and looked for the man herself, finding that he was not anywhere on the fourth level. She learned where he had been when she caught him coming down the stairs.

“What were you doing?” she asked.

“Looking if the gates were truly broken as our friend Zenzele said,” Tupoc said. “You can never be too safe, yes?”

You are lying, Angharad thought, looking at his easy smile. We missed something and you found it.

“The purpose of this arrangement was to share information,” she evenly said. “Not hoard it.”

“That you think that,” he gently told her, “is why you’ll lose.”

Her jaw clenched.

“Perhaps I should put an end to this contest, then,” Angharad said, fingers gripping the handle of her saber. “If you do not respect the spirit of the truce, why should you protected by it?”

Tupoc grinned.

“Come now, Remund only stayed in your lovely lady’s quarters for a bit,” he said. “Not enough for you to get jealous over, surely?”

Angharad stilled. That he would taunt her over that and not Isabel’s visit to her rooms was… Lan had told no one else about Isabel’s visit, she realized. Gratitude, however guilty, seized her soul. It changed her mood enough that she took her hand off her blade, to Tupoc’s visible disappointment.

“A man can only take so much teasing, Tredegar,” he gravely reproached.

“We are still under truce,” Angharad replied. “And why should I value even the shallows of my honor more than the likes of your life?”

“Well,” Tupoc Xical mused, “if you are going to sweet-talk me so, I suppose I shall have to forgive you.”

One day, Angharad thought, he would push her and there would be no strictures of honor protecting him.

She was going to savor that day.

—

The second council between the three of them was largely ceremony: none of them had found the killer or even a solid lead. Tupoc was sitting on secrets – and likely so were she and Yong – but with silence holding there was resolution to be had. They sent for everyone to come out for a common address, the seventh hour having crawled dangerously close. The revelation that no culprit had been found did not go over well, not that Angharad had expected failure to be met with applause. Even less popular was the acknowledgement that there was now only one way forward, through the gate that would open in under an hour.

But what other choice was there?

When the seventh hour came all seventeen took the gate, eyes on each other as much as the dangers that lay ahead.

# Chapter 30

On the other side of the gate waited not a test but a tunnel.

Narrow and damp it led them up for fifteen minutes, occasionally at so strong an upwards tilt that some of them slid on the smooth stone and tumbled back into others. It was a relief when they emerged into open grounds, entering some sort of strange water garden. It looked like a large pond with islands of stone tracing a path across, but the waters turned out to be fathomlessly deep. And the path itself was occasionally chancy path, as they soon realized that the ‘islands’ were in fact the top of pillars reaching up from the deeps – and that some had been eaten away at by the water.

When one toppled Lady Acanthe fell into the water, beginning to sink almost immediately.

Had Master Cozme and Shalini not dragged her out she might well have drowned. More worrying still was what that Acanthe Phos assured them she was a skilled swimmer, only the water had been unnaturally ‘heavy’. She’d compared it to trying to swim through molasses.

They were all glad to be rid of the place, all the more when the last island brought them to a dilapidated First Empire highway that, aside from the occasional loose stone, presented no danger at all. Two opportunities to take a left off the highway led straight into dead ends, one of them a strange black stone shrine whose closed door was thankfully received, and after a second hour’s worth of walking they reached the top of plunging stairs. The end of the highway was broad enough for nearly all of them to have a look at the distant silhouette of the temple-fortress, which awed most into silence.

Some of them, anyway.

“I don’t care what the blackcloaks claim, that is not a temple,” Zenzele Duma announced. “Fly a flag on it and all that’s missing is Izcalli footpads to shoot at.”

“I’ll rustle up a flag if you can get Xical to stand still,” Lady Ferranda offered.

Angharad was not amused, because it would have been beneath one of her breeding to snort at such low-brow humor.

She had merely been clearing her throat.

Truly, however, Zenzele had a point. Ferranda had described their destination as a ‘temple-fortress’, but what Angharad beheld leaned distinctly towards the latter word. Stairs so roughly carved they were barely noticeable went down an abrupt slope for at least a few hundred feet until they reached the bottom of a cauldron. Or so it seemed, for on all sides hundreds of shattered shrines stacked onto one another formed incomprehensible: it was a cacophony of broken faiths, a wall whose every brick was the ghost of some ancient promise.

It troubled Angharad, looking at it too long. The sheer amount of shrines reaching up to the sky, a tombstone of silenced laments drenched in the golden light of the firmament above. This was a graveyard of spirits, and its utter silence was more menacing than any chorus of wails.

Rising from the center of the cauldron’s bottom rose the promised temple-fortress. It was not in the shape of the modern fortresses – stars and angles and bastions – or even of older keeps with towers and tall curtains walls. Instead it was a thing of tiers, full red walls shaped like circles interlocking like a haphazard pile of plates balancing one way and the other. There were eight levels and almost twice as many circles of varying size, the broadest and highest at the bottom and narrowing as they rose. At the summit of the very highest tier a small tower in the same red stone stood, leading to a narrow stone bridge that connected to the top of the surrounding cliffs.

The way forward, presumably to the Toll Road that Ferranda had claimed was the very last stretch of the maze.

“I’ve seen that kind of stone before,” Shalini Goel shared. “My family comes from south of Mahabhara, and the cities on the shore of the Arama River use it for everything.”

Angharad knew at least one of those names: Mahabhara was one of the great powers inside the Imperial Someshwar, their rajas usually wrestling with those of Varaveda and lesser rivals for who was to claim the Maharaja’s scepter – and with it the authority to rule over all of the Imperial Someshwar, at least in name. Someshwari were a famously fractious lot.

“I thought you were Ramayan,” Yong said.

“I am,” she assured him. “The Goel are merchants, when we expanded into Ramaya a branch of the family settled accordingly. I was born there myself.”

Ah, Angharad thought. The nature of the ties between Lord Ishaan’s house and the commonborn Goel was at last made clear. The merchants must have sought the help and protection of local nobles when settling there, as was only proper. Even more proper was such ties resulting in the Goel providing a fosterling and attendant to someone of the Nair line, tightening the bonds between nobles and a wealthy subject. It was important, Father had always told her, to remain on good terms with the wealthy living on your lands.

“Fascinating,” Lord Remund cut in, his tone indicating he thought it anything but. “If we might perhaps attend to the fortress before us?”

“It is useful information,” Brun mildly replied. “It means the god within might be of the Someshwar.”

“I do not recall asking for your-” Remund began, so Angharad stepped in.

Clearing her throat, she raised her voice over his.

“We should get moving,” the noblewoman said. “The stairs seem dangerous so we will have to be careful going down.”

They’d had enough of a rest gawking, so her suggestion was taken without argument. No one wanted to spend too long out here when there was still a murderer hiding among them, much less be stuck spending a night out. Lord Zenzele took the lead, Lady Ferranda volunteering to go behind him. The pair had stood together on the same unstable pillar earlier, narrowly keeping it from toppling by shifting their weight, and taken to each other since. Angharad hardly thought their griefs were the same – Zenzele had lost his lover and his aunt, while Ferranda only a close retainer – but that grief was shared could not be denied. Friendships had been made of less. She herself followed behind Ferranda, Lord Ishaan in turn claiming the space behind her.

“What a noble vanguard we have,” Yong drily said.

There were some laughs, so Angharad was somewhat relieved when Yaretzi volunteered to be next before Shalini could step in. She had not noticed earlier, but it was true that the nobleborn among them tended to take the lead. The captaincies had come at an end, however, and now an unthinking assumption of leadership was not without risks. There was hardly a trace left of the old crews in how the group held themselves, relying on such a structure would be a mistake.

However difficult the stairs looked, they were significantly worse in practice. Not only were they narrow – too much to fit her entire boot on – they were short, many and winding. Angharad had to be careful with every step, never lapsing in attention, and the absence of anything like a railing was discomforting. If someone fell, there was absolutely nothing to hold them back. At least half a mile of such labor, surrounded by the creeping cliffsides, would be exhausting work. By unspoken agreement they began taking breaks regularly, spread out across different sections of the stairs, and one such pause was when Lord Ishaan approached her.

“It occurs to me,” the chubby-cheeked man said, “that we have had little occasion to talk since Aines’ body was discovered.”

The angle he stood at hid his scar, bringing back a shadow of the soft look he’d had when the trials began. Angharad considered him. Learning from Lady Ferranda that he had planned to send five of them into what was quite possibly their death – not only Tupoc and Ocotlan but also the underserving, Lan and Aines and Felis – had not endeared him to her. Nor had that she had been headed for a deeper part of the maze instead of the end and the man had not meant to inform her as much. No, that last part was unfair. She was merely assuming, he might have planned otherwise.

But it had not gone unnoticed by Angharad that few people who joined Lord Ishaan and Shalini’s crew ever seemed to want to stay there.

“We have not,” she acknowledged. “Events dictated otherwise.”

“Elections do tend to be rowdy business,” he smiled.

The way it tugged at his cheeks revealed a hint of the scar, like a face peeking out from beneath a mask.

“Have you given any thought to the third trial?” he continued.

She hid her surprise.

“The Trial of Weeds? I must confess to my attention has remained on our present tribulations.”

“It might be wise to begin thinking ahead,” Lord Ishaan advised her. “Many who are now your allies will depart once they reach sanctuary, returning to Sacromonte.”

“That is true,” she cautiously agreed, “but as I know little of the nature of the third trial I cannot say if that will be a disadvantage.”

Besides, Song intended to become part of the Watch and the same was true of Brun. Without the infanzones at her side there should be nothing preventing the three of them from making common cause for the Trial of Weeds. It was Lord Ishaan, on the contrary, who looked exposed to her eye. Who still stood by him, save for Shalini?

“It is rarely an advantage to be alone,” Ishaan said, then shrugged. “I would not urge to you an early decision, but keep in mind that Shalini and I would be glad to have you with us when the time comes.”

A polite non-answer was already on the tip of her tongue, but Angharad stopped herself. She had a real look at the other noble instead, at the worn stance and the sleepless lines that could be seen even on the half of his face he showed. Ishaan Nair did not look so sinister to her, in that moment, just a man who was tired and feeling the edge of the pit creeping ever closer.

“You have to know it has a bad look,” she quietly said. “They do not talk ill of you, Lord Ishaan, but they do leave.”

He sighed, passing a hand through his hair.

“I know,” Ishaan said. “It is…”

The Someshwari hesitated.

“I suppose you will learn eventually,” Ishaan finally said. “Unspoken rules only go so far. Shalini’s contract has… drawbacks.”

Angharad could not reveal she had once glimpsed the gunslinger putting two shots in Tupoc’s eye faster than the blink of an eye without revealing details of her own contract, but Shalini’s supernatural skill with pistols was no secret.

“They are not visible,” she admitted.

“They would not be, where you’ve seen her use it,” Ishaan said. “But out here it is another story. I shall avoid details, but it might be said that when she uses the contract it sometimes draws… attention.”

She paused, the implications of that word sinking in.

“Spirits?”

“Gods, lares, lemures,” he agreed. “Maybe even those who use Signs. Out here in the maze, it has mostly drawn the eye of remnants – the echoes of dead gods. You should have encountered a few.”

Only one, but that had been memorable enough. Yaretzi would have fallen off the ledge had Angharad not caught her by the collar when the screeching thing appeared.

“Refraining from using the contract would put an end to the risks,” she carefully said.

One must always tread lightly, when speaking of contracts. Ishaan grimaced, his expression resigned. As if expecting scorn.

“It would be the wise choice, if she could make it,” he said. “There is a reason we chose to seek out the Watch, Lady Angharad. Both our contracts would benefit from the lessons they have to teach.”

She cannot control when she uses the contract, Angharad realized. Or not always, which was near as damning. So every time Shalini used her contract it sent up a flare for any creature looming and she could not promise she would cease sending them up. Sleeping God, no wonder their crew kept bleeding people. Especially here in the maze, where the cause and effect would be even more obvious than during the Trial of Lines. Neither were being outright malicious, Angharad thought, but it was no wonder that so few had supported Lord Ishaan during the earlier debates. It might not have been out of malice, but he had still put their lives at risk.

Yet what else was he to do, abandon the childhood friend he had come here with?

The colder part of her, the one her father had taught, whispered that he might well have been sending Tupoc’s entire crew to their deaths simply so there would be fewer options besides staying with his own. Had everyone gathered back at the Old Fort tonight and Angharad learned that Ishaan’s gate led to the end of the maze, she would almost certainly have negotiated for their crews to ally and return together. And in a way, she thought, the Someshwari had gotten what he wanted – they were all going forward as a single crew.

Yet he had not gotten what he needed: Ishaan had no authority here, and if Shalini’s contract began causing trouble the pair were certain to be cast out. Perhaps even violently. All because there was only a single gate that could be used, so any claim he might have had to it being ‘his’ was little more than wind.

“You might have made steadier allies had you revealed it from the start,” she said.

“We would have had no allies at all,” he replied, shaking his head. “Better to have them for a time than never.”

Much as she disliked the approach, she was not certain he was wrong. And he had not lied, she would give him that. It did not make up for his condemning five trial-takers to die. As if sensing her disapproval, he turned fully – light caught the scarred side of his face as it faced her at last, coloring half as if it were a different one entirely.

“There is more to say,” he told her. “But perhaps this is not the time and place.”

“Perhaps not,” Angharad replied, inclining her head.

They left it at that, resuming their way down the stairs. Only it could not have been more than a minute or two before she caught a flicker of movement behind her – she had been betrayed, Angharad thought. He was to be rid of her as he had wanted with Tupoc, suffering no other former captain and… and then she realized that Ishaan was not attacking her but falling.

On her.

Shouting, he tumbled forward and in a snap decision Angharad glimpsed ahead.

(The man on her back, the two of them rolling down, scything through Ferranda’s legs from behind as she fell off the stairs and screamed-)

As a girl, Angharad had once spent six months taught by grim-faced and tattooed man from Uthukile who had claimed to be the Prince of Black Hill. His lessons had all been about what he had called ‘the gale-game’. The Low Isle was under constant siege by storms, he’d told her, sea and wind carving ever deeper grooves into its bluffs and canyons. From those constant companions the people of the Low Isle had learned lessons. Mother’s take on the teaching had been simpler: he is here to teach you how to fall, she’d said. Into the calm, Angharad thought, bending forward as Ishaan hit her back.

The worst mistake you could make was to fight the gale. The gale always won.

Chin tucked, arms up, and Angharad embraced the fall: enough that even as Ishaan hit the stairs she kept falling forward. There was shouting but she ignored it, turning with the fall and making a roll out of it. Stone bit at her back for the merest heartbeat, but she twisted forward and finished the tumble. Her boots hit the stone, pain tingling up her legs, and for half a dozen feet she skidded down the narrow stairs with gritted teeth. Her left leg came forward a bit but not before she slowed, her momentum slowly grinding to a halt until she was left half-crouched and now far past both Ferranda and Zenzele – who had gotten out of the way without her even noticing.

Panting, Angharad rose to her full height and brushed off her shoulders.

“I fall, I stand,” she told the wind, as her teacher had taught her. “Try again if you dare.”

She did not speak Matabele, for all that the Uthukile dialect had the same root as Umoya, so she was not entirely sure that was truly what the words meant. Prince had been a profligate liar, and the only time she had told Father the words he’d choked and instructed her never to repeat them in front of guests. Yet there was something satisfying about speaking the words, she thought. Almost like a victory prayer. That sliver of satisfaction was short-lived, however, as shouting from above forced her to turn that way.

Both Zenzele and Ferranda seemed fine but Ishaan was hurt, she saw as she carefully climbed back. He was cradling his arm and bruised across the face. He was also not the source of the shouting.

“I saw you push him,” Shalini insisted, pistol out.

“I wasn’t anywhere near him,” Yaretzi bit back. “Am I to be called a killer because he saw fit to trip?”

Someone stepped in between them, but by virtue of it being Tupoc Xical it was the opposite of reassuring.

“Yaretzi is right,” the Izcalli mused. “I’m sure her being a killer is entirelyunrelated to Nair being a clumsy fool.”

The pistol moved off the first Aztlan to the other, which Angharad knew was the moment Shalini lost the crowd. Tupoc was despised, and she suspected only one more incident away from being turned on, but pointing that muzzle at more than one person had made Shalini look overwrought, out of control. It had cost her credibility and as no one else seemed to have caught what happened credibility would be what decided the contest. Even as Angharad bit her teeth and wondered how to intervene – Shalini must be wrong, what could Yaretzi possibly gain from attacking Ishaan? – the claimed victim spoke up by himself.

“Pistol down, Shalini,” Ishaan said, getting to his feet with a wince. “I felt something push my back, but I suppose it could have been the wind.”

There was a breeze, however faint. The other Someshwari looked conflicted, but eventually she noticed the unfriendly looks her waving around a weapon was drawing. With gritted teeth she put away the pistol, and there was a slight adjustment to the order of descent. Yaretzi went behind Angharad, warily eyeing the pair from Ramaya, and the climb down resumed with a broader gap between climbers than ever. No one wanted to earn another accusation.

It still took them the better part of an hour to get at the bottom after that.

From down there the temple-fortress seemed even more towering. Natural stone, touched with red lichen, led them to massive open bronze gates. There were some small ponds of stale water they went around, but soon enough they all gathered before the handful of steps leading into the temple. There was some hesitation, but the walk to the gates had been rest enough and none wanted to spend the day waiting out here. They ventured up the stairs cautiously, past the red stone of the floor and onto the cavernous hall within.

Lamps hung from barely-seen rafters, casting slices of yellowing light on walls dripping with tapestries and trophies. There seemed to be no rhyme nor reason to what hung there. Angharad saw children’s toys side by side with ornate silver bucklers, then a musket besides what she suspected to be a Pereduri fertility necklace. Ivory tusks, jewels, blades – all of them placed over spans of wool, linen and silks that depicted everything from wars to the Sleeping God’s grace descending upon the unworthy. The scale of it should have brought out awe, but somehow Angharad could not help but feel as if she were looking at some magpie’s trove.

At the end of the hall they were treading awaited an audience room, lit by the same hanging lamps, and on the raised dais at the center the noblewoman first saw the spirit they were to bargain with. A vividly colorful bird the size of a carriage – a peafowl whose tailfeathers were tucked in – bore on its back a golden cradle, which held the desiccated shape of a man in red silks. Neither spirit nor mount moved as their group approached the threshold of the gate. Angharad, breathing in, crossed it first and offered a respectful bow to the desiccated spirit.

“Honored elder, I greet you,” she said.

There was a long moment of silence, then the bird let out a cackle.

“Lower, child,” the spirit said. “He has not answered anyone in a great many years.”

The peafowl spirit’s eyes were bright blue and wide open, staring down at her with amusement. Angharad swallowed.

“Honored elder, I greet you,” she tried.

The bird sniffed.

“Are you ignoring my master?” it demanded.

Angharad swallowed again, unsure how to answer, until the bird began cackling.

“That’s fine,” the peafowl hiccupped. “He’s dead.”

A soft curse in Samratrava from behind her, which rather echoed how she was feeling, then Lord Ishaan was at her side and bowing through a wince. His arm must still hurt. He said something in the same tongue, which had the peafowl spirit preening and nodding – and so the corpse atop its back shaking around.

“She’s a mayura, Lady Tredegar,” Ishaan then told her in Antigua. “Not exactly a god, since they do not come alone. They are-”

“The finest divine mounts to ever exist,” the spirit cackled, striking a pose as her tailfeathers snapped open in a dazzling display. “Behold my greatness!”

A moment passed. There was nothing spiritual about the plumage the Pereduri was looking at, as far as she could tell.

“They are very nice feathers,” Angharad finally said.

The peafowl preened, shuffling back and forth on her spindly legs.

“They serve as the mounts of victory gods,” Ishaan mildly said. “When surviving their riders they are known to grow… eccentric.”

She glanced sideways at him.

“Victory gods?”

“When a great victory is won a god is sometimes born of it,” the Someshwari told her. “They are all children of the Six-Headed One, but have will of their own.”

“They get them out of defeats as well.”

Angharad turned, seeing Yong had approached while she was distracted.

“Some crawling thing came out of the fields at Diecai, a few weeks after,” the Tianxi told her. “The Watch had a free company waiting to kill it.”

“I had not heard, though I see no reason to disbelieve a veteran of the Kuril Dance,” Ishaan politely said before his attention returned to her. “I was taught it is not so uncommon phenomenon across the span of Vesper but that my people’s ties to the deeper truths of the Orthodoxy makes it more frequent where we rule.”

The dark-skinned noble could almost hear the echo of four dozen acrimonious religious wars – fought and yet to be – in that last sentence. The Sleeping God was a blessing in more ways than one. Angharad’s eyes slid back to the peafowl, who to her faint surprise did not seem all that put off with the tangent unrelated to her. She was, the Pereduri thought, listening to them almost eagerly.

“Am I to understand, noble elder, that this temple is now yours?” she asked.

“That’s right,” the peafowl happily said. “The Greedy One slurped up Kshetra’s insides, but instead of getting its hands on this place the claim passed down to me.”

Angharad glanced at Ishaan to see if the name brought up anything, but he sighed.

“It literally means ‘tract of land’,” he murmured. “There are more minor gods with that name than there are lords in Izcalli.”

Ah. She supposed not every battle happened to be fought in a place that bore a proper name. It seemed odd, however, for a minor spirit to have earned such a grand temple. Her momentary distraction was rewarded by another person stepping in, though Song joining them before the spirit was most welcome.

“The Greedy One,” Song repeated. “It is a most fearsome name – would you tell us of your divine foe, mighty god?”

The peafowl preened again, easily flattered. Angharad was beginning to feel a little guilty about this.

“It’s not a real god,” the mayura contemptuously said. “It did not come of the Golden Egg like we did, taking shape from nothing. It was forged long ago, by the-”

The spirit suddenly stopped.

“Nononono,” she said. “I keep forgetting: questions only at a price. To go forward, to learn, you must take my tests!”

The mayura skipped around the dais, beak pecking at things unseen. Before Angharad could even begin to consider what that was about, cascades of blue and green silk fell down from the ceiling in waves. Fluttering curtains surrounded them on all sides, and the spirit made happy noises.

“Supplicants,” she said. “You have come to the temple of the great Kshetra!”

She shook her back a bit, the desiccated corpse in the cradle jerking around. Should one squint, its arm might have done something akin to a wave. Morbid.

“A crossroads stands before you,” the peafowl announced. “At the summit of this holy place waits the path that will take you to the end of this maze.”

Behind her, golden light coursed down the blue silk like rivers. It traced a silhouette, resembling the shape of the temple-fortress as they had beheld it outside. Six ‘plates’ were haphazardly stacked atop one another, each delineated as its own section – including the hall where they now stood, at the very bottom of the stack. From the tower at the summit a strand of gold unfolded, leading into a curl whose meaning was unclear.

“There is another path,” the mayura said, “for those unfit to brave our tests.”

At the third level, a strand of gold unfolded and reached out… to the side? There was nothing there, though in her mind’s eye Angharad supposed something coming out of the temple horizontally would go into the cliffs.

“Yellow tiles will lead you back to the very beginning of the maze,” the spirit said. “A gift from the great Kshetra! Such largesse, however must be earned.”

Lord Ishaan cleared his throat.

“How may we earn your grace, great mayura?”

“Each of the old temples hosts a champion and their test,” the peafowl told him. “To earn the right to climb, you must defeat them.”

“Old temples,” Song lightly said. “I thought this all belonged to the great Kshetra’s inheritor?”

The mayura shifted uneasily.

“There used to be twelve of us,” she said, “though-”

The spirit paused, eyeing Song, and something like anger passed through those blue eyes.

“You may no longer speak.”

There was a ripple in the air, the curtains of silk fluttering like an incoming storm, and Song hastily bowed before backing away. The peafowl watched her unblinking, the displeased stare pushing Song all the way back to the ranks before releasing her. However fickle the spirit, it had been dangerous of the Tianxi to attempt to trick her into surrendering secrets for free. Best to change the subject before the mayura decided to express her displeasure more concretely.

“Must all six tests be passed for us to cross, honored elder?” Angharad politely asked.

If so, she feared corpses would ensue. The spirit let out a pleased cackle.

“This is a land of victory, so we honor it above all else,” the peafowl said. “You may instead face a test while under restriction, making your deed all the greater!”

Angharad cocked her head to the side. Curious as she was to get to the end of this temple, it should be clear to all what was most urgently needed. It certainly was to her.

“How may one earn the right of passage to the beginning of the maze?” she asked.

“Three to rise,” the mayura said. “Another to cross the gap.”

Simple enough: aking the test for one ‘win’, then three restrictions to pay for the rest.

“Then that is the wager I ask of you,” Angharad said.

To her left Ishaan choked. The peafowl, however, seemed most pleased.

“Then right attitude. I present you then the challengers,” she said, prancing about the stage.

The golden light began to twist again, taking the shape of a man.

“Ojas the Clever, who you must defeat in a contest of riddles that-”

“Next,” Angharad said.

The giant bird somehow gave the distinct impression of a pout. Light shifted again.

“Urvashi Cloud-Foot, whose deadly race across the sky-”

“Not her either,” Angharad said.

“No one ever picks Urvashi,” the spirit complained. “You should hear her moan about it.”

“The others, honored elder?” she pressed.

“Amrinder Ever-Champion, whose gift is to know and match your every skill at arms,” the peafowl tried. “He must be defeated in a duel.”

Startled, she almost laughed. A mirror, was it?

“Him,” Angharad said. “I will face him.”

The mayura flicked her feathers.

“A worthy choice,” she said. “Let us speak of oaths, then. You must give three.”

“I will use no weapon beyond my saber,” Angharad offered.

The peafowl nodded.

“I receive your oath,” she said.

The air shivered.

“I will not use my contract,” Angharad offered.

The mayura leaned closer, considering with those large blue eyes, then she opened her beak to taste the air with her tongue. Coolness slithered through her veins, the Fisher’s attention called, and the peafowl drew back hastily.

“Yes, best keep that out of the test,” the spirit said. “I receive your oath.”

The air shivered anew. There Angharad hesitated, considering what else she might offer. Somehow she figured leaving behind her coat would not be sufficient, however fine a coat it might be. An answer came from a most unexpected helper.

“Spare the champion,” Tupoc suggested.

She turned, frowning.

“Pull a killing blow,” he clarified.

That sounded… surprisingly sensible. She turned to the spirit, silently asking if such an oath would be received. The mayura considered it, then slowly nodded.

“Twice,” she said. “Pull a killing blow twice.”

She did not flinch in the face of the terms: what was there to fear, facing herself in a mirror?

“Agreed.”

“Then I receive your oath,” the mayura said. “Follow me, I shall show you the way. The rest of you can wait here.”

—

The spirit led her through halls of red stone, sloping and turning in ways that did not fit what she had seen from the outside. It was constantly chattering, and oddly insistent that Angharad be the one who take the test should her group attempt to reach the summit of the temple. When she dared asked why the mayura was only too happy to explain.

“If you die here I will gobble up the corpse,” she said, “but the last test is different. The wager is that those who fail it will become a champion of this temple.”

The mayura happily pattered about, missing the horror on Angharad’s face.

“You seem like you would be pleasant to keep,” she said. “So try not to lose until that test, yes?”

The spirit then flicked her wing, ushering her forward into a doorway of red stone.

“Amrinder waits within,” she said.

Angharad went through.

—

It was a graveyard.

Walls of bare stone closed in from all sides, solemnly leaning over a field of ash. Scorched bones peeked out of the grey like lurid smiles, pierced and broken by weapons enough to fight a war: swords and spears, curve knives and axes and broken butlers. A war was fought here, Angharad thought. One corpse at a time. Ash creaked under her boots as she approached the specter at the heart of it all: sitting on a mound of cinders and steel, a stern-faced bearded man with long unbound hair waited. A faded red and yellow vest covered a long padded tunic touched with bronze scales, but it was the worn banner the man had wrapped himself in that caught her eye.

Even color had long dripped out of the cloth, leaving behind stale paleness that spoke of nothing but use.

“My name,” the specter said, “is Amrinder. May you perish bravely.”

“A mirror has no name,” Angharad simply replied, and drew her sword.

The man shook himself to his feet, the banner fluttering down into the ash – he was taller than her, Angharad thought, though not by much. Lightly, almost daintily he plucked out of the ash a curved blade that resembled her own saber. She closed the distance.

“Skilled, for your age,” the specter said, as if tasting her talent. “But I am that and more. Arrogance makes for quick contests.”

Ten feet lay between them. It was nothing at all; it was the entire world. Two steps, measured, and Angharad’s saber began to rise towards a duelist’s salute – Amrinder matched her, only for his eyes to narrow when she immediately darted forward and hacked at the side of his neck. Left hand parry, but his blade was thicker and slower. It kept her off his throat, but only until she pivoted behind him and brought the bottom of her blade, near the guard, to rest against the nape of his neck.

“One,” Angharad counted, and drew back as he chased her off with a swing.

She could have carved into his spine, if she so wished.

“Have you no honor?” the specter bit out. “To strike during-”

“A mirror has no honor,” she replied.

Fury on the stern face, thick black brows pulling angrily. He pursued, high guard mirroring her own, and across the ash they danced. Ten feet, Angharad measured again as she slipped under a blow and the hem of her coat brushed against the ash. The specter left no footsteps, but the strength of his blows kicked up slashes of cold ash – half-a-breath brushstrokes, traced and blotted by the same wink of steel. Parry, cut and spin with the specter’s long blow. He might not tire, but for all his thicker arms he was slower: his blade not as slender, his footing not as fine.

The specter swept his guard low, inviting the blow, and she took the invitation. A feint near the head, immediately drawing an upwards cut at her belly, but she caught and swept it to the side. In the moment where he drew back his head to slam it into her own, she brought up her free hand and slapped him on the side of the throat. The specter choked, half-stumbling, and before he could steady his footing Angharad took half a step backwards, disengaging her blade and pulling back her arm – the point came to rest against the hollow of his throat.

“Two,” Angharad counted, and gave ground.

Ash flew as the specter’s anger swept the grounds, dark eyes grown wild as he slashed away and she maintained her distance. Ten feet: no more, no less.

“There is a trick,” the specter said. “A contract. How else could you prevail twice?”

“It is not obvious?” Angharad asked.

The specter’s blade slowed, wary but listening. Her eyes met his.

“You are fighting as a rendition of me,” the mirror-dancer calmly replied, “when I am already the finest such rendition.”

And to her surprise, that gave him pause. Anger bled out of the bearded man’s face, leaving behind the bones of soft rue.

“I had forgot,” he said, blade lowering.

She cocked her head to the side, her guard up. He smiled.

“What it felt like, the sting of pride.”

His thick saber slid out of his grip, down into the ash, and the specter turned his back to her. She could have struck, Angharad knew. Pierced through him from behind.

The Fisher’s answer, victory at any cost.

So instead she stood there as the specter returned to his seat and gently took up the banner, carefully brushing away every trace of ash. He wrapped it around his shoulders until it settled as a loose half-cape, trailing behind. Only then did he climb to the summit of the mound, where lay a wooden shaft. It was ripped free, revealing a long spear ending in a spearhead thick and long as a hand. The specter, readied at last, turned to her again.

“My name is Amrinder,” he said, hoisting his spear. “When the city fell and they came for the maharana, I held the garden alone until the nightingales sang.”

Her saber rose to tap against her left shoulder, a salute owed.

“Lady Angharad Tredegar of Llanw Hall,” she replied. “Ten times have I danced with the mirror.”

“You are a fool, Lady Tredegar,” Amrinder laughed, for a heartbeat young. “May you win.”

Angharad breathed out, taking three steps forward as she chose a fresh distance to engage from, and in the heartbeat that followed she nearly died.

The movement as Amrinder came down the mound was fluid, almost hypnotic, and as her eyes struggled to follow the head of the spear she realized too late she was misjudging his reach. The step back she took by reflex turned a thrust that would have gone through her throat into one that sliced along the side of her neck. Amrinder drew back his spear as she swallowed, bringing up her guard as blood began trickling down her skin. A spurt of fear, but stillborn. There was no musket here, no throng of enemies and no wicked contract. A man and a field, that was all that faced her. Life and death were in her own hands.

Angharad breathed out; the dance began anew.

He was better with his spear than Tupoc. Faster, more polished and full of tricks. A sweep kicked up a cloud of ash into her face but catching the glint of steel through allowed a narrow parry, her riposte catching only the banner’s fluttering cloth. When she gave ground he pursued, when she pressed forward he circled to harass her legs – twice scoring shallow cuts – and when she maneuvered for a better angle he mirrored her smoothly. Trying to follow the tip with her eyes was death: it wove, dazzling and smooth and always a foot closer to her flesh than it seemed.

Sweat trickled down her back and Angharad’s breathing grew labored while Amrinder fought with the tirelessness of the dead, but fear found no purchase in her. There was a weakness, she thought. And she thought she might have caught a glimpse of it earlier, when he almost slew her. The angle of the thrust had been slightly off. He pulls to the left.

It took her three bouts and a rip into the hem of her coat before she found the grounds she needed. The axe buried into a skull she ignored, but the ornate halberd and the three swords – standing together like grave markers – drew her footsteps. She moved and watched and waited, eyes on his arms and not his spear. Unlike the spearhead, those did not lie. Angharad pressed forward and the specter circled to the left, so immediately she gave ground. He pursued, as he always did, and then came the breath that would kill or crown her.

Amrinder thrust forward viper-swift, feet leaving not a trace on the ash, and Angharad stepped into it. She had meant to avoid the steel entirely but the spear head was too broad: it carved into the side of her vest instead of getting caught in her coat like she’d wanted. Either way, gritting her teeth through the pain as she felt steel bite into the flesh above her ribs, she bunched up her coat and caught the spear. The specter, without hesitation, took a step back to rip his spear free.

And Angharad won.

He had gone around the jutting swords without thought, pursuing her, but then he had struck at her – and when striking, Amrinder pulled to the left. So now he stepped back right into the swords he’d avoided, tripping, and Angharad burst forward with a shout. Arm thrusting forward, point straight, she rammed her saber into the specter’s heart even as his back hit the ash. It went through the padded armor, into what should have been flesh but was nothing at all. It was as if Angharad had struck air, and air was what her eyes found.

“Oh,” Amrinder gasped, eyes smiling.

A heartbeat later she was looking down at nothing but a faded banner, breathing raggedly. Angharad fell to her knees in the ash, eyes closed and shivered as the sudden coolness of the air.

Victory.

—

The peafowl was waiting for her beyond the doorway.

“Very exciting,” she chattered as she led Angharad back down. “It was delicious to watch.”

The Pereduri tugged her coat closed around her. Now that her sweat had cooled, she was stinking and cold.

“Your companions thought the same,” the mayura added.

Angharad’s steps stuttered.

“I do not take your meaning, honored elder,” she said.

“They watched as well,” the mayura lightly said. “I could not give them the sounds the way Kshetra used to, but moving shapes is well within my power.”

The golden light, Angharad thought, the one that had moved like water. Had she done anything foolish? The noblewoman was still wondering whether she should be mortified when the spirit led her back to the others. Her half-formed fears melted away when a crowd formed around her in the blink of an eye, everyone seeming to want to pat her back or talk to her. It was a little overwhelming, so she was grateful when Isabel took her by the arm and tugged her back a little. The crowd calmed after a few more moments, and then it was Angharad’s turn to speak.

She had passed the test, so now she wanted the prize.

The spirit did not quibble, though already she spoke of when they would all return. Once the mayura showed them to the right hall, the way forward was simple. Up two flights of stairs they went, then to a slender drawbridge of white wood that was already lowered when they arrived. They crossed it into the left side of the great cliffs surrounding the temple, through an empty shrine where the wind echoed like eerie bells.

From there on, just as the spirit had promised, yellow tiles marked a path forward.

It took them through stairs and shrines, then up on a great ridge made from the collapsed dome of a temple. It was one of the very highest points of the maze, enough they could dimly make out a sprawl in every direction, and in the golden light of the aether machine they made out a descending path. Following the yellow tiles – which grew rarer and rarer, but never ceased – they stayed on a high road of ceilings and empty ruins for half a day’s worth of walking, only taking a break to eat.

Come what should be late afternoon, Angharad recognized her first shrine: the curved one where Lady Inyoni had fallen to the test of the cog god. Passing that observation along revived everyone’s flagging vigor and they redoubled their efforts. The very last yellow tile, found after the tiring climb down a flight of stairs so large they might as well have been walls, led them all atop the narrow passage that they knew as the Serpent Shrine. They were back, the distant lights of the Old Fort beckoning them to safety.

Song and Angharad were the first to take the rope down and they stayed together as everyone gathered to head back to the fort. Both were too tired to chat. The last quarter hour walk back stretched an eternity, but as the blackcloaks on the wall greeted them with waves Angharad let out a long breath. They passed through the breach in the rampart, returning to sanctuary, and treading the ground of the courtyard loosened something in the noblewoman’s shoulders. Knowing there were muskets on the walls, that the Watch would see to their safety, was a comfort.

“I think might take a nap,” she told Song. “It is unseemly, I know, but I am falling to pieces.”

The Tianxi did not reply, and when Angharad turned curiously she saw that Song held herself tensely. She was staring behind them and the Pereduri followed her gaze to find it was resting on the laggards of their group – Lan, Acanthe, Felis. One of the blackcloaks guarding the entrance, a young man with the Malani look, laid a hand on Felis’ chest as he crossed the breach. The man glared, all the more when the watchman took a sniff of him and then a second. The Sacromontan said something Angharad could not hear, and it must have scared the blackcloak for he drew back.

No, Angharad realized. The young Malani was looking elsewhere, towards the barracks. Against their wall Lieutenant Wen was leaning, eating from a bowl of those horrid mushroom crisps Lierganese were so fond of. The young watchman nodded and Wen sighed before raising his hand.

“LAST ONE IN!” the Tianxi shouted.

Felis’ eyes widened, Angharad saw it even from where she stood.

“Wait, no, I-”

The fat lieutenant’s hand came down and three dozen muskets thundered.

Smoke billowed out in plumes from every direction, spreading through the utter silence of the courtyard, and Felis’ mangled body dropped to the floor.

“We warned you,” Lieutenant Wen said. “If you make a contract in the ruins report it immediately, or you will get shot.”

# Chapter 31

Black-cloaked watchmen carried away Felis’ body.

 What remained of it, anyway: musket balls had turned the man into red rags.

Tristan felt no grief at the sight. If there was a tragedy in Felis it was in who he had been, not who he’d become. Dust, fear and poverty had worn away the good and left the bad in sharp relief. What remained had not endeared him to the thief, though neither had it been deserving of scorn. It did not matter whether a stone was marble or gravel: if you left it at the bottom of the canal long enough it would all be ground into nothing. The Law of Rats was not like the halo of Glare bestowed upon the great estates of the infanzones, some unblinking and unceasing stare. It lived in the spaces between, let in by the lamplights of the Murk growing worn and flickering. Letting in the dark a little further every year.

It was easy to be virtuous when the lights never went out.

The same souls that’d left the Old Fort as three crews returned now as a single crowd, though seemingly twice as wary of each other as before. Tristan had counted them coming in and found only one missing: Aines. There his heart had clenched, if only for a moment. Just another dead rat, he told himself. The same eulogy he would get when his end found him, an unmarked grave made into words.

“Something happened,” Maryam quietly said from his left. “They wouldn’t be like this if Aines had died in a test.”

She was right, Tristan thought. Felis getting dropped had shattered the last remnant of solidarity in the returning crowd, the lot of them scattering in small trusted pockets as if they’d never gone through the trouble of gathering larger crews in the first place. Pressure to come apart, Tristan thought, but there had always been that. That it was now working implied there was no longer stronger pressure for them to stay together. Given the timing and context, one answer stood above the rest.

“They found a path to end of the maze,” Tristan guessed.

“That doesn’t explain why they’re looking at each other like someone’s about to pull a knife,” Maryam replied.

He hummed.

“You think there was a fight?” he asked.

“I think Jun’s been sent company down in Nav,” Maryam said.

The thief cocked an eyebrow at her. The implication he caught – she believed the killer had struck again – but the last word was unfamiliar.

“The place where the dead go,” she said.

“Graves, if they’re lucky,” he said. “Dogs if they’re not.”

“Grim,” she praised.

“I try,” he humbly replied, lips twitching.

Even as they shared smiles, though, his mind raced. Why Aines? The middle-aged woman had been physically weak, but there were others just as vulnerable and she’d rarely been alone. Unless, of course, Felis’ proximity had been the point. To frame the man as an attempt had been made to frame Tristan. That would require, however, some very specific knowledge. Who else knew about the red games, knew there was something to frame Felis for? Lan did and he’d himself told Yong. Probably Tupoc, Tristan figured, and that likely meant Ocotlan. Maryam, of course. None of these fit the shadow on the wall.

“What are you thinking?” Maryam asked.

“That the Watch just shot our best lead,” Tristan replied. “We’re going to have ask about how they reacted after the kill – they didn’t hang anyone for it, but did they investigate?”

If they had, there was a chance that at least one person had been clever enough to ask Felis who else knew about the red games. It’s not necessarily him, the thief then corrected. Tristan himself had come into suspicions that Felis was out to kill his wife through hearing about Aines’ half of the puzzle. Someone else could have done the same. And Lan could have sold the information, he tacked on. Felis had still been the best lead, however. He needed to find out if someone had thought to try that avenue. His eyes flicked to Maryam.

“Can you find out if Lan told anyone about the red game around those two?” he asked.

He could not do so himself, having publicly feigned falling out with the twin. Maryam nodded.

“You really think you can find out who the killer us?” she asked.

“Not enough to prove it,” he said. “But then I’m not angling for a hanging.”

Forcing a truce, keeping the killer away from anyone he was conspiring with, would be more than enough. He wouldn’t mind killing them if he could, given their actions against him, but he already had more than enough revenge on his plate.

“If I can out them, I will,” Maryam warned him.

He grimaced but eventually conceded with a nod. It was not his right to dictate otherwise to her, much as he would prefer otherwise. So long as she was aware he was disinclined to play the savior at her side. Tristan pushed off the wall, wasting no time in seeking out Yong. The Tianxi veteran had carelessly dropped his affairs on the courtyards floor, put his sword on the table and was now pouring himself a drink in a kitchen cup from his own flask. Even from across the table, where Tristan slid into a seat, the smell of the rotgut was biting to the nostrils.

“Thought you’d show up,” Yong said, tone not yet slurred.

Though not for long, Tristan thought as the Tianxi knocked back his cup before filling it anew. The other man’s fingers were shaking, however subtly, and he looked haggard.

“What happened out there?” the thief asked, voice coming out softer than he’d thought it would.

“Someone cut Aines’ throat,” Yong bluntly said. “It went to shit after that. Lots of arguing, everything came apart and then we chose three people to look into it.”

Tredegar was a given, but with Tupoc’s group having lost two – Augusto and Aines – the situation would have been fluid.

“Tredegar and Tupoc and me,” Yong specified, brushing back a loosened bang.

Despite Vanesa’s best efforts, the former soldier’s hair refused to be tame now that the topknot was lost.

“What did you find?” Tristan asked.

Yong leaned over the table, grabbing a second cup from the loose pile of plates and cutlery the Watch left there for trial-takers to use, and set it down in front of the thief. He tipped his flask over it.

“I don’t drink,” Tristan said.

Yong only stopped when the cup was two-third full. The smell of that Watch rotgut was genuinely foul, the grey-eyed man thought.

“Drink anyways,” Yong flatly replied.

Tristan gauged the other  man’s expression and found it all too serious. His lips thinned, but he nodded and took the cup in hand. He didn’t actually drink, of course – liquor was a poison worse than nightshade or arsenic, which only ever hurt those who drank it – but he wetted his lips and pretended. Yong downed his cup again, and the thief hoped he would either slow his consumption or quicken his report. He’d soon end up waiting on an unconscious man otherwise.

“Fuck all,” the Tianxi said. “Fuck all is what I found. Lan says Nair and Goel are sleeping together and that Lady Ferranda was up to something shady, but it wasn’t any of them. I got no closer to figuring out who did it.”

Tristan grimaced.

“Felis, did you interrogate him?” he asked.

“Everyone did,” Yong shrugged. “Even Tupoc, though I think that was more about sitting tight on him. He stayed too long for anything else.”

Tupoc Xical. Of course it had to be the inconvenient bastard who figured out the right trail to follow. This did not surprise Tristan, for he had long known fortune to be a disagreeable creature by virtue of having been saddled with the divine equivalent of the concept’s drunken aunt.

“And after?” he pressed.

“We followed the path to some great temple-fortress,” Yong said. “Once we pass that, it’s a straight line to the end of the maze.”

“With tests on it?” the thief frowned.

“Presumably,” Yong shrugged.

The Tianxi poured himself another cup. This would serve as a bare bones report, but learning a fuller picture would have to wait until Maryam got it out of Lan or he found an opportunity to speak with Isabel Ruesta. Tristan studied the other man, wondering what it was about the recent deaths that’d shaken him so. He’d not been like this when Sanale died, or the other deaths since. And he must have presented sober enough to be picked by the others after Aines died, so it shouldn’t be that either.

“Was Felis on dust for the way back?” he tried.

The older man laughed at him, the sound slightly slurred.

“You think I see myself in him?” Yong said. “You’re still young, Tristan. The need, it’s not a coterie or a regiment – you don’t feel for the others who have it. It’s just as selfish as any other hunger.”

The thief’s face tightened.

“Then what is it about his death that pulled out your seams?” he asked.

Yong breathed out slowly, shallowly.

“What’s the most muskets you’ve ever heard fired at once, Tristan?” he asked.

“Just now,” he replied without hesitation.

Blackpowder was hardly unheard of in the Murk, but no coterie cared to wield muskets carelessly. A shot in the back once in a while drew little attention, but thirty men unloading down a street? That was the sort of thing the Guardia would make a point of stamping out, Murk or not. Yong filled his cup to the brim.

“Past a certain number of muskets it doesn’t really matter how many were fired,” the older man said. “It all sounds the same to our ears – we’re only so good at picking out sounds, you see.”

Tristan’s belly clenched.

“It sounded like a volley.”

“It’d been a long time since I heard that,” Yong softly said. “Gods, but I wish it had been longer.”

The thief had meant to ask more of him, to make his offer, but it could wait. At this rate the Tianxi would collapse into bed soon anyway. If he could even get back to it. Tristan feigned drinking again, lips burning from the strength of the rotgut. He was planning how to take his leave when Yong cut through.

“My turn to ask questions,” he said. “There’s a rope ladder out there, one leading into the pillar. What happened?”

The thief laid it all out from the beginning, all the way to the god waiting behind the broken lock and the existence of the lift he had confirmed.

“And you think it’ll lead to a way past the maze?” Yong asked.

“It has to,” Tristan said. “The devils got all these shrines in here somehow, and it was not the way the Watch is using. Besides, the Antediluvians would have wanted a way to access their ceiling device without needing to go the long way around every time.”

“Don’t assume that,” Yong warned. “There’s no way to reach the Luminaries back in Tianxia.”

“Those are set in firmament,” Tristan argued. “This is much smaller in scale.”

Yong hummed, then after a long time nodded.

“All right,” he said. “Who are you thinking of taking in? We’ll need muskets, unless you want to rely on the Watch to get rid of the god for you.”

“I don’t believe we need to kill the god,” Tristan said. “Only drive it off. We don’t need a regiment, we need a good shot and salt munitions. Between that and Sarai’s Signs, we should be able to get to the lift safely even if it’s lying in wait.”

“And I’m your good shot,” Yong said.

When sober, yes, Tristan thought.

“How are you going to get salt munitions?”

“I am going to ask politely,” he replied with a pleasant smile.

The Tianxi snorted.

“Fine, keep it close to your chest,” he said. “And you’re certain the Watch will let us try for the lift?”

“Yes.”

His suspicion was that Lieutenant Vasanti wouldn’t let him go in with a crew, only alone, because she was greedy for the knowledge inside. How fortunate for him that Lieutenant Vasanti was not the only officer in the Old Fort. That bargain would cost him, but he had arranged to make it later tonight anyway.

“This might be riskier than heading into the maze again,” Yong finally said.

Tristan mustered arguments in his mind, but held back. He would let the Tianxi think it through first at least.

“But then the tests are getting nastier and I’m not a victor yet,” the older man said, stroking his beard. “Not to mention there’s a chance I’ll get a visit in the night.”

His face tightened.

“One musket is little,” Yong finally said. “Let me try to rope Lady Ferranda into this.”

Ferrand Villazur, despite her deplorable birth, had proved reliable. He could live with the mild discomfort of relying on an infanzona, should she accept.

“So long as she swears secrecy first,” Tristan replied.

The other man nodded.

“And if Ferranda declines?” the thief pressed.

“You are still the better horse,” Yong said, passing a hand through his hair.

The former soldier tried to rise, but his limbs were numb. Tristan half-rose himself, helping him back down onto the bench.

“You can talk to Lady Ferranda later, at dinner,” he said. “Maybe take a nap first.”

“Maybe,” Yong said.

But his eyes were back on the flask and his cup empty once more. The thief had no intention of staying to see what would come that.

“We will talk later,” he said.

Yong dismissed him with a wave of the hand, which was no longer trembling. Tristan grimaced. It was not his place to pass judgement. He left in haste, though, and was relieved when Maryam caught his eye from where she sat at Lan’s side. The pale-skinned woman shook her head. So Lan had not sold information about Aines and Felis. That cut down on the possibilities. Who else had been in Tupoc’s crew aside from the now-dead pair? Ocotlan, Lan, Augusto. It could not be Augusto, who had not been present for the second killing, and Ocotlan would not have been so discreet. As for Lan, she would not have murdered her own sister.

Her grief after had been too raw to be false.

It must have been someone from another crew, then. Chasing every face, every possibility, would be a waste of time. Besides, there were too many secrets still being kept for him to be able to figure out a culprit from what he knew. He had to follow the secret he did know about, which meant it all went back to Felis and Aines. If Felis had been the source of the leak, Tupoc should know. That meant the Izcalli’s whereabouts were worth a second look. And, interestingly enough, when Tristan had said look the Aztlan was missing. As was Yaretzi.

Asking around would have drawn attention, been too telling, so instead the thief chased them on his own. There were only so many places for them to go, here in the Old Fort, which led him to the answer soon enough: they were not in the Old Fort.

They had gone back out of the walls to have a look at the rope ladder and the new opening in the pillar, the two of them standing out in the open. Tristan did not  try to hide from the blackcloaks as he passed through the breach, but after that kept to the shadows of the rampart as he snuck closer to the pair. They were talking, and the conversation did not look to be pleasant. Yaretzi, for all that her expression was calm, held herself tensely. Her hand was not far from her long knife. Tupoc, on the other hand circled around her like a vulture while grinning. The man’s good moods were rarely an indication of pleasantness for anyone else.

“-of you working for free?” Tupoc was saying. “Bad for business, Turquoise.”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” the other Izcalli evenly replied. “If you want to accuse me of being the killer, Tupoc, do it in front of everyone.”

She gave him a hard look.

“Only you won’t, because you’re fishing,” she said. “You’re just another warrior society prick trying to get a flinch out of people because that’s the only thing that still gets you off.”

Fuck, Tristan thought. Tupoc doesn’t know who it was. He wouldn’t be pressing someone without proof like this if he did. Which meant Felis had not been the one to talk, it’d been Aines. That would be a much harder trail to follow, if it was possible at all. He’d not kept all that close an eye on Aines, and could not think of anyone who might have. The thief had what he’d come for, but lingered in the shadows nonetheless. This talk had the sound of a secret to it, and you could never have too many of those.

“Oh, I don’t have enough to strangle you with,” Tupoc cheerfully admitted. “But I know one thing: that wasn’t the omacaliztli stance in the labyrinth. When your life is on the line, you don’t fight like a diplomat.”

“You’re-”

Tupoc, thought listening to the other Aztlan, suddenly took a wary look around. It gave Yaretzi pause. Time to go, Tristan thought. He had no intention of being caught eavesdropping.

The moment Tupoc looked away, he retreated.

—

There was no need to find a way to talk to Isabel Ruesta because she found it for him.

A whisper transitioned into playacting, the infanzona sitting on the bench closest to his bedroll as he went to fetch his medicine cabinet. Some parts of it, anyway. He’d obtained pure alcohol and some bandages from the Watch physician a few days back – the man had been adamantly against opening his stocks for anything more – so the thief found himself kneeling before the dark-haired noblewoman and cleaning her ‘wound’ with a liquor-drenched cloth. It was but a small cut on the back of the hand, not nearly enough to warrant the garrison doctor’s attentions and so a decent excuse to go to him instead. Had she done it herself?

He did not care enough to speculate.

“I told Remund that his hovering would make me uncomfortable,” Isabel murmured, “but we only have so long.”

Tristan smiled, nodded.

“I expect the day after tomorrow we might reach the end of the maze,” she said. “Now is the time to act.”

“Can you get me into your crew?” he asked.

“I will tell Angharad you asked if her invitation still stood,” Isabel said. “It will be more than enough.”

There was no doubt at all in her voice. She sat there, comfortably looking down on him as he swiped across the wound one last time and reached for bandages. He was surprised the infanzona had not flinched at the sensation of alcohol on an open cut, however slight. Tristan had thought her mettle strictly of the scheming kind.

“How will you do it?” she asked.

“Is there a room where it will be easy to split up the group?”

She nodded as he wrapped the bandages around her hand.

“Before the mirror hall there is a room with a wheel and three gates, it is certain we will get separated there,” Isabel said.

“Then I will go with him,” the grey-eyed man said, “and return to the Old Fort after.”

The infanzona slowly nodded.

“To withdraw,” she guessed.

“I came here for revenge,” Tristan said. “Why risk my neck beyond obtaining it?”

Isabel lowered her head in acknowledgement.

“May your sister rest easy afterwards,” she murmured. “Good luck, Tristan. If we do not speak again, it has been a pleasure.”

Tristan only smiled back, tying off the last of the bandage and rising to his feet. They had already lingered too long, he could feel eyes at his back. Lady Isabel must have felt the same, for she departed without as quickly as she could without being rude. Tredegar would soon appear to fuss over the bandages, no doubt. Fortuna strolled out from behind him, artfully arraying herself on the bench just vacated by the infanzona and brushing back her curls as if posing for a painter.

“Why did you lie about the Trial of Weeds?” she asked.

Tristan feigned a yawn, covering his mouth.

“Because she is a snake,” he replied. “If she thinks she will be rid of me after it is done, she is less likely to scheme to have me killed.”

He would, after all, be a loose end for the infanzona. Someone who knew she had bargained for the death of a member of House Cerdan, a secret she could easily be extorted over. Tristan somewhat expected she would still try to have him disappeared, but at least until the deed was done he was safe: she had no other executioner to call on. As for after, well, he did not intend to follow her back to Sacromonte where a word out of her mouth would be able to summon a dozen armed guards.

“She’s interesting, that girl,” Fortuna mused. “Just the right combination of foolish and clever.”

Now he almost felt bad for the infanzona. Had there even been praise more damning than the Lady of Long Odds approving of your character?

Lips twitching, he picked up his affairs and returned to his bedroll where the cabinet waited. It was still mangled from the Trial of Lines, and sadly he did not have skill enough at carpentry to fix it beyond the very basics. In truth, it was probably no longer worth it: there was little left inside, nothing he could not move into a bag with some care and forethought. The limping gait that approached from behind as he stood there needed no introduction. There was only one person in the Old Fort using crutches.

“Vanesa,” he said, turning to face the old woman.

Her face was pale, he saw with a flicker of worry.

“Tristan,” she grimaced. “I hate to ask, but do you have anything in your cabinet for pain?”

He shook his head.

“All the substances I have left are poisonous to some degree or another,” he told her. “Save for the turpentine, which would do nothing for pain.”

Not entirely so, as the extract of the bearded cat mushroom only induced violent madness, but he had been broadly exact. Neither white arsenic, mandrake or antimony would be of any help to Vanesa. Even as a way to end the pain, he would recommend against them. None were gentle poisons.

“Are you quite certain?” she pressed, sole eye steady on the cabinet.

“Nothing pleasant would come of anyone drinking from those bottles,” he firmly said. “Shall we go ask the physician for another dose of poppy?”

“My dosage is already too high, he says,” Vanesa told him. “Any more and I would be in danger.”

“Poppy is a strong drug,” Tristan said. “It might be best for you to sit and rest, perhaps. At least for a little while.”

“I might sleep through dinner,” the old woman conceded. “My appetite wanes.”

Which was not, he thought, at all a good sign. But the outcome had never been in doubt from the moment Vanesa refused the amputation. If they could reach the sanctuary before the third trial, however, if a safe end were in sight? Then, he thought, perhaps she could be talked into reconsidering.

“Besides,” Vanesa tiredly said, “there is more than one kind of pain. Poor Brun, it is as if the boy is cursed.”

He cocked an eyebrow.

“How so?”

“First he was sweet on that girl Briceida who was taken by the hollows,” she said. “And now poor Aines, killed in the night.”

Tristan stilled.

“They were close?” he asked with forced lightness.

“They diced after supper sometimes,” Vanesa said. “I am not surprised you never noticed – Felis was a jealous sort so they kept it out of sight.”

Brun. Brun had been talking with Aines since they reached the Old Fort, perhaps learning about the red game. Tristan’s mind raced, looking over the angles. The Sacromontan had a contract, one that could be used to sense people but whose workings remained unclear. Brun had been there every time there was a death. Motive? No, best not to guess too hard at that. Digging blindly at a stranger’s motives was a waste of time. Who else could it be?

Ishaan, perhaps helped by Shalini, but none of the deaths had ever been to the advantage of the Ramayans. Yaretzi, but whatever it was about her that Tupoc thought he’d found it muddled the waters. There were only so many terrible secrets someone could bring at a time. Not Song, she is here for the same reason as Maryam. Neither should it be the infanzones, whose venom was turned inwards, and that left only three: Acanthe Phos, Yong and Ferranda.

And Tredegar, if you needed a laugh.

The Asphodelian’s contract did not fit, however, and Tristan’s personal doubts aside Yong often went to sleep drunk. Unfit to commit murder. That left Ferranda Villazur and he misliked her for the deeds. For one, she and Sanale had been alone with Lan for some time before Tristan’s crew stumbled into them. It might have been that Sanale was unaware of his lover being a killer so she had refrained, but that was a tortured plot. That left Brun, the polite young man in the corner who everyone liked, who had been making all the right decisions. It might be that the fair-haired Sacromontan had a knack, Tristan thought.

Or it might be that his contract was not what it seemed.

“Tristan?”

The thief shook his head, smiling at Vanesa.

“Sorry,” he said. “I was lost in thought. Poor Brun indeed.”

The old woman patted his shoulder.

“You should rest as well,” she said. “You look tired.”

“Soon,” he said.

There were still two talks left ahead of him.

—

Brun of Sacromonte had the kind of features that most people found handsome in men: good skin, symmetrical face and a strong jawline. Good looks, good manners and a calm demeanor likely left few to guess he came from the Murk, but Tristan had been able to tell from the start. It was in the little habits, the way the man always put a wall behind him when he could but avoided being in corners.

It was the way someone small around larger folk with little kindness learned to act.

The other man – only a few years older than Tristan, going by his appearance – was cleaning his pistol when the thief sought him out. He only used half the bench with the work, which left enough room for Tristan to sit. Brun’s eyes flicked up, took him in and then he put down the cloth and pistol.

“Tristan, isn’t it?” Brun said. “We haven’t talked much.”

“No, we haven’t,” Tristan smiled. “Yet somehow I feel as if I know you.”

Brun cocked his head to the side, then discreetly curled his fingers into the Mark of the Rat.

“You know better than to have to ask that,” the thief replied.

The fair-haired man shrugged.

“It felt polite to pretend,” he said. “To what do I owe the pleasure, Tristan?”

“I have a problem, Brun,” he lightly said.

“I am keeping my nose clean,” the other rat replied, tone apologetic. “Joining the Watch is to be a fresh start for me.”

“That’s exactly what I want,” Tristan agreed. “A fresh start. It’s a different sort of world out here, isn’t it? All these rules, all these walls.”

The man calmly met his eyes.

“I don’t follow your meaning,” Brun said.

“Bad habits take a while to shake,” the thief said. “But I’m not a redcloak, Brun, and the black’s a few weeks away yet. I’m not one to judge.”

The man looked lost. Tristan might even have believed him, if those eyes had wavered at all.

“I don’t know what-”

“Sarai,” he said. “Yong. Francho. Vanesa. Lan. If something happened to them, I would be most terribly cross.”

“Tristan,” Brun patiently said. “Evidently you came to believe I am involved in something, but-”

The thief leaned in close.

“I’m not asking you to confess, Brun,” he quietly said. “Not even to nod. We both know you won’t. I am simply telling you that if you come for me or one of mine, you will find out you are not the only one who can cut throats in the night. And there will be no silencing me, either: I have told others, so your little secret has already spread too widely to be buried.”

Maryam had agreed they did not have enough to get the man hanged, though she had reserved the right to tell others. Francho had not even needed to be asked to keep quiet, the old man fascinated by the entire affair but disinclined to intervene.

“This is ridiculous,” Brun sighed. “If you believe I am the killer, by all means put it to everyone. I will prove my innocence.”

“You very well might,” Tristan shrugged. “Which is why I see no reason to bother.”

“That is disturbing in many ways,” the man noted. “I believe this has gone on long enough: please leave.”

“I think we understand each other,” the thief agreed, rising and stretching his limbs.

He paused, and on a whim said one thing more.

“Would you say the world is loud, Brun?” he asked.

The man looked like he’d just found a knife slid into his belly, but it was only for half a heartbeat. The calm politeness was back in place after that. But there was wariness in those green eyes now, something that’d not been there before.

“No, Tristan,” Brun finally replied. “I find it, in truth, to be frightfully quiet.”

And the thief was not sure why, but there was something about than answer that sent a shiver down his spine.

—

Meeting was never going to be difficult.

Meeting discreetly however, had been another story. Passing a message through Sergeant Mandisa had yielded results, an hour and a place. The rest he had arranged himself. After supper Tristan had a quick conversation with Angharad Tredegar, who confirmed he was welcome to venture out with her on the morrow. Riding that arrangement as an excuse, he returned to the Watch’s armory to acquire equipment that would help him scale the broken remains of the crystal mirror maze as was planned by Tredegar and her companions.

Lieutenant Wen was waiting for him inside, biting into an apple.

The man was wearing his spectacles and he leaned against an empty sword rack, loudly crunching the fruit’s flesh. When he swallowed, loudly, Tristan nodded a greeting.

“Lieutenant,” he said.

“Pissant,” Wen easily replied. “You told Mandisa you have something important to tell me. I should not need to tell you there would be consequences to wasting my time.”

Pretend you’re not interested all you want, Tristan thought, you still arranged a meeting where Vasanti wouldn’t see us.

“I need salt munitions,” he said. “For muskets and pistols.”

Lieutenant Wen bit into his apple, loudly chewing and swallowing. He only spoke after.

“One,” he said.

“One?” Tristan repeated.

“I’m counting the number of times you’re going to tell me something I could have you shot for,” Wen said. “But please, do go on. You were able to tell me why I should entrust a bottom-feeder expensive munitions that are the property of the Watch.”

“I want to lead a team into the pillar,” he said. “I’ve found a path to the summit I haven’t told Vasanti about.”

“Two,” Wen counted, then took another bite.

He ate more quickly this time, not drawing it out for effect.

“I fail to see why that means I should give you munitions,” the lieutenant said. “I’m feeling like confiscating some of yours, in truth, so that I can hear you die horribly through the door and then argue for it to be welded shut forever.”

“Because if I don’t get there first, Lieutenant Vasanti will,” Tristan said.

Wen looked unimpressed. I’m losing him, the thief thought.

“So she’ll get what she wants, leave and I won’t have to deal with her next year,” he said. “Are you done wasting my time?”

What did Wen want? Besides being thoroughly unpleasant to everyone and a second helping at every meal, what did Lieutenant Wen actually want? Tristan’s eyes narrowed.

“Next year,” he repeated. “You will still be here next year. There’s no debate, your posting is already decided and you know it.”

Wen’s face tightened in anger, and Tristan knew he had found his angle.

“Do you like it here, lieutenant?” the thief asked.

“It’s being strangled to death every day, only I have to wake up the following morning and go to work,” Lieutenant Wen mildly said.

“What if there were no longer a reason for a garrison to be posted at the Old Fort?” he asked. “If, say, the laws that created this maze were suddenly changed to make it untenable.”

The fat lieutenant watched him for a long moment.

“Three,” he finally said, and bit into his apple.

Tristan kept his face calm as he was studied through the spectacles.

“Standing orders are that should anyone outside the garrison ever figure out what the Red Eye is, they cannot leave the island alive,” Wen idly said. “But you didn’t figure out anything, did you Tristan?”

The dark-haired thief went very, very still. He’d not thought he had given away anything, but he had been sloppy. Wen, beneath the bluster and colorful language, was dangerously canny.

“You mean the cult’s god?” he asked, lips dry.

“You’re a fucking fool,” Wen said. “Do you think you’re the first clever rat that disappeared during the second trial? The higher-ups always knew on occasion someone would figure it out.”

Tristan’s eyes narrowed.

“And yet you haven’t called for other watchmen,” he said.

Silence stretched between them.

“Do you know what it really means to be part of the Watch, boy?” Lieutenant Wen finally said. “Once you strip away all the lies and the propaganda and the prettied-up history?”

He slowly shook his head.

“We kill the things that feed on mankind,” Wen said, and for once there was not a trace of a sneer in his voice. “When horror comes crawling out of the box, we slam the lid on its fingers.”

The large Tianxi straightened his back.

“For the first century,” he said, “we looked for ways to kill the Red Eye. Tried everything from Signs to aether machines, spent a fortune on this nowhere shithole island. But nothing took, and there were so many other monsters that couldn’t be locked up for so cheap a price. And it cost coin, Tristan, to kill those other monsters. Men and steel and ships.”

“So they stopped trying,” Tristan quietly said.

“When I tried two years ago, the request to allocate funds for new attempts didn’t even make it to the Conclave,” Wen said. “Commander Artal took one look at the paper and laughed. The committee responsible for our region wouldn’t even read it, he said. I might as well wipe my ass with it, at least it’d accomplish something.”

Lieutenant Wen’s expression darkened.

“Whatever you find up there, boy, you’re not just going to play around with it,” he said. “Vasanti might be able to fix that. It’ll change nothing.”

The watchman leaned forward, the light of lamp reflecting against his glasses to hid his eyes.

“It’s a wonder of the Ancients up there, Tristan Abrascal, and you are going to break it.”

# Chapter 32

Something was off.

That was his first thought when he woke, for all that someone was staring down at him.

“Ferranda declined. We’ll have to do without her.”

Tristan rubbed his eyes blearily, hiding his discomfort by throwing Yong half a glare. At a look, people were only just beginning to stumble into the courtyard – the usual early birds. The only person already in the kitchen was Vanesa, whose late nap last night must have shortened her night.

“How are you this much of a morning person?” he complained.

No one was around him save for Yong, so why were his hackles raised? It was a blind thing, like smelling rain on the wind, but Tristan had not survived this long by ignoring his instincts.

“Can’t yell at your men for not waking up fast enough if they’re awake before you are,” the Tianxi cheerfully replied. “Up and at it, Tristan.”

Fortuna, leaning over his shoulder, covered a yawn with her hand.

“He doesn’t even look hungover,” she admiringly said. “His liver must be cast iron.”

He would have glared at the goddess if he could. The thief fought against the urge to yawn for a moment before giving it up a lost cause, earning a mockingly raised eyebrow from Yong. It wasn’t like Fortuna even got tired, she was yawning purely to yank his chain.

“I secured the munitions and permission to enter,” Tristan said. “We can proceed when I return.”

Yong, crouched by the curtain that served as the ‘door’ to his room, openly frowned.

“I don’t understand why you have to head out at all,” he said.

“I am not asking you to,” Tristan firmly replied.

Even the implication that his actions were up to debate was best snuffed out early. The former soldier raised a hand in appeasement.

“I won’t dig,” he said. “But you need to be careful, Tristan. If you die out there the plan falls apart.”

That was, in fact, not true. It had been arranged for Lieutenant Wen to deliver the munitions and orders to Maryam should Tristan perish and it was Francho who would be the ace after they took the lift up. They needed someone capable of deciphering cryptoglyphs, not a thief. Even Yong, who would wield the musket and salt munitions, was arguably more important to the cause than Tristan at the moment.

“I have taken measures in case it happens,” he vaguely replied. “But I assure you I have no intention of making a mistake this late in the game.”

“That much I can believe,” Yong said, then hesitated.

The Tianxi bit the inside of his cheek.

“You’re usually cautious, until the bullets starts flying,” Yong said. “This kind of recklessness is unlike you.”

The unspoken question hung loud in the air. It was his instinct, as always, to sidestep it and keep his past a guessing game. But Yong, he’d extended trust. He had told Tristan of the sorrows that brought him here, the reason for the shaking hands and the drink that steadied them. It was not a debt, not exactly, but neither was it nothing. Abuela would have called this mawkishness, chided him over considering something as childish as reciprocity. Every secret is a stone, she’d taught him. Every time you share one your tomb grows closer to finished.

But he’d learned, since coming to the island, that he’d known even less about Abuela than he’d thought.

“I have debts that need settling,” Tristan finally said.

Yong hummed. He did not ask to whom, or what kind of debt. The veteran knew better.

“And they are best repaid here?” he asked instead.

“There might not ever be anywhere else,” Tristan honestly replied.

If he did not act now, the Cerdan brothers and Cozme Aflor would slip his grasp and return to Sacromonte. Once they returned to the safety of the Orchards, the walled districts where the infanzones dwelled under the light of the Glare, they would be beyond his reach. He could live with the brothers surviving his attentions, but Cozme Aflor? There were five names on his List and most of them had either vanished or gone behind tall walls. He would not surrender the opportunity to cross out even the name at the bottom.

Remund Cerdan would die, and through him Cozme would be forced to either seek out Augusto as a last ditch to salvage his position with House Cerdan or try for the refuge of joining the Watch. Either way, Tristan would get a clear shot at him.

Yong’s dark eyes met his, searching, and at last the older man nodded.

“They always tell us that revenge isn’t worth it, you know?” Yong said. “That it isn’t worth burning your life for, that it will make you no happier after. A hollow victory at best.”

“And was it?” the rat asked. “Worth it.”

The Tianxi smiled, slow and cold as the bite of spite.

“When I think of that last gasp rattling past her lips,” Yong softly said, “it warms the cockles of my heart. Even now, after all these years. I’ve regretted a lot of things, Tristan, but my revenge never once.”

The older man clapped his shoulder before rising to his feet.

“Good luck,” he said.

The thief watched him leave in silence, sorting himself out. It was not exactly trust, what lay between them. They both knew the other had intentions they would not compromise on, even at the other’s expense. But there was an understanding, he thought, and in some ways that was more reliable than trust. Less blind. And something worth keeping around, if he could. Maryam had implied that whatever opportunity was to be offered to him after these trials would not be offered to Yong, but perhaps there were ways around that.

And now that Yong was gone, no longer distracting him, the unease returned. Rain on the wind, clouds in the distance.

“You know that’s a married man, you harlot, so reel in that longing gaze.”

The thief hid his surprise. He had not heard Lan approaching, so it was on the backfoot that he began as Lan grinned down at him unpleasantly. He rose to his feet, pulling down his clothes into place. Unease could wait, lest he miss another rat biting at his tail.

“I thought we were feuding,” Tristan said.

“We’re reconciling,” Lan told him. “There’s no longer a group around Tupoc and we’re both headed into the maze, yes? Best bury our grudge in case we run into one another.”

The thief rolled his shoulder.

“You don’t intend to come back here.”

It was more a statement than a guess.

“I’d rather ride Tredegar’s coattails than risk your scheme,” Lan frankly replied. “As long as we don’t lose too many people on the last stretch of road, the trial is in the bag.”

He conceded with a nod. Tristan did not necessarily agree, but neither could he say she was wrong. Chances were high that the last tests would be brutal, but taking a swing at a relatively easy one then hiding behind the Pereduri for the rest of the trial was not a bad strategy. If Lan got lucky with her test and became a victor she could spend the rest of the Trial of Ruins as a spectator – much as Isabel Ruesta had. She was unlikely to be bothered over perceived cowardice: this close to the gate  and with so few trial-takers left, victors were too precious a resource to be risked.

“Sensible,” he nodded.

He paused, after, and considered whether or not he should continue. After his conversation with Yong, though, it would have felt like a betrayal not to.

“I believe it was Brun,” Tristan abruptly said.

Lan went very still, then forced a smile on her face.

“How sure are you?”

“Enough to approach him over it,” the thief said.

He could not be entirely certain, not with what he knew, but Brun was the most likely to be the killer by a fair amrgin. It was only the issue of motive that held Tristan back from speaking in stronger terms.

“Interesting,” Lan said, her tone flat and dead. “I’ll get the details out of Sarai, so no need to belabor. His reasons?”

“Unknown,” Tristan admitted, then passed a hand through his hair. “But there is something off about his contract.”

“A killing price?” she frowned. “That is very illegal.”

It was one of the few things the Guardia bothered to chase after even in the Murk. Not out of worry for the rats, of course, but because such contracts were illegal under the Iscariot Accords and failing to stamp them out would mean Sacromonte was in breach.

“I don’t know about that,” he hedged. “I do not think it so straightforward, but I also doubt his contract is as simple as feeling presences.”

Lan slowly nodded.

“You are being generous with information,” she said.

He was, though not as generous as he could have been.

“If we are to part ways, let it on good terms,” he replied. “It costs me little to give you this.”

The blue-lipped woman hummed, considering him.

“Someone went into your room during supper last night,” Lan said. “The curtain wasn’t the same way you left it.”

And like that the unease he had been slowly shedding was back.

He stilled, mind spinning. Had Lieutenant Vasanti come to suspect him? There would have been nothing for her or her minions to find. He had not hidden the brand in his room, preferring to tuck it away in one of the abandoned bastions, and the stone buttons never left his pocket. Only Francho and Maryam knew where the brand was, since he’d tasked them with trying it on the machine Vasanti wanted them to study. I’ll have to look through my belongings after breakfast, see if anything’s missing.

What did he even have that was worth stealing? Most his arms and clothes came from the Watch and the rest of his affairs fit in a single bag. His cabinet wasn’t worth much without knowledge of the vials and how to use them, and believed to be a medicine cabinet besides – pointless to steal from when the Watch physician could be relied on instead. Lips thinning with worry, he nodded his thanks to Lan. She snorted.

“It has been a pleasure to work with you, rat,” she said. “To my surprise.”

“And you,” Tristan replied. “We’ll meet again in the Trial of Weeds.”

“If you don’t bite off more than you can chew,” she teased, then waved him away.

It was a fitting goodbye, he thought, for the likes of them. If not for the revelation someone had gone through his things it would have lifted his mood. Instead it was with a frown he ventured out for breakfast, finding that the usual already seated. Tupoc and his crew were always the first to leave in the morning, so even though there were now much reduced – there remained only Ocotlan, Lan and a very nervous Augusto – they had claimed their usual table. Tristan went to sit with Yong, who had gone ahead, and within a moment had a bowl of porridge in front of him. He looked up at Vanesa, who had been the one to bring it, and cocked an eyebrow.

“You have been doing it for me every morning,” the old woman smiled. “I thought I would return the favor at least once.”

She looked better this morning, he thought. Not as pale as she had been for the last few days. His stomach clenched at the sight, though. Pleased as he was she was doing better – enough to move around on her crutches and hand people bowls – it put him on edge. Her wound was not the kind of wound that got better.

“And we all benefit from you,” Yong drawled. “She brought mine as well.”

“You didn’t need to,” Tristan told Vanesa.

Her breath, he noted, was slow. Slower than it should be, though if this had been too much it should be quickened instead.

“I wanted to,” she replied, jaw set.

And looking at her, at the determination in her last eye and the way she stood, he paused. Something was off, he’d felt from the start. Something was off about her. His gaze flicked to the other table.

“Them too?” he casually asked.

Vanesa did not answer.

“She’s too kind,” Yong said. “Tupoc should be starved, not fed.”

But it wasn’t Tupoc Xical that Tristan was looking at, Lan or even Augusto Cerdan. It was Ocotlan, the big bruiser with the Menor Mano tattoos on his arms. Who had served as a legbreaker for that coterie. Vanesa, he remembered, had come here in her son’s place. A son whose leg had been broken by the Menor Mano for unpaid debts. Two days back, Tristan had walked away while Vanesa had been spellbound by Augusto Cerdan recounting Ocotlan’s boasts. The bruiser’s stories about the things he had done for the Menor Mano.

The details fit each other like cogs, clicking into the place.

“Vanesa,” he quietly said. “Tell me you didn’t.”

The old woman sighed, then lowered herself onto the bench at his side. She leaned the crutches against the side of the table, comfortably resting her shoulder against the thief’s.

“It’s too late, dear,” she said. “He’s already on his second bowl.”

Yong’s eyes widened as he looked at them.

“Vanesa,” he whispered. “What did you do?”

“I put down a rabid dog,” the old woman said.

And what Tristan heard, when she said that, was a trigger being pulled.

It was three more seconds before the shouting began.

The thief watched, grey eyes unblinking, as Ocotlan toppled forward. The Aztlan was convulsing violently, foaming at the mouth until he began vomiting all over the table. Tupoc and Augusto fled from him, as if his very presence were dangerous, while Lan stumbled onto the ground in fright. The spectacle attracted the attention of everyone in the courtyard,  including the blackcloaks.

“What did you use?” Tristan hoarsely asked. “What vials, how much?”

Passing this as an allergy was unlikely. Cold pooled in his stomach. There must be a way to frame, to turn the truth around until it said what he needed it to say.

“The three in the upper compartment,” Vanesa calmly said. “I apologize for the theft, but I wanted to be sure.”

The thief choked.

“The entire vials?” he got out.

She nodded and he breathed in sharply. His entire stock of white arsenic, mandrake and antimony. Each of them a lethal poison, each of them so concentrated it was enough to use five drops to kill a grown man. Vanesa had dumped enough poison into that porridge bowl to kill every soul in the Old Fort twice over. No wonder it had taken minutes instead of hours for Ocotlan to react. Tristan breathed out, forced himself to calm. To think.

“It was Brun,” he suddenly said. “Yong, you saw him enter my room last night after dinner. I’ll head there and report someone stole of my medicine. We should have enough witnesses.”

If Brun’s head was on the line then Lan was certain to pitch in on their side. Would Maryam lend a hand? Even odds, he thought, but she wanted them rid of the killer and was pragmatic enough to use an opportunity should it be handed to her. That many voices should tip the balance their way even though they had nothing but witnesses. Vanesa smiled gently and patted his hand.

“You are a nice boy, Tristan, but it is too late for that as well,” she said.

His eyes narrowed.

“If you already confessed,” he slowly said, “we can say you were forced, that-”

“After serving him the bowl,” Vanesa said, “I drank three days’ worth of poppy. My limbs already feel numb. It should only be a few minutes now before my breathing stops, the doctor was quite clear about the dosages.”

Tristan swallowed. The way her face had been pale from pain last night, she had not been feigning it. She’d been saving up the poppy so she could drink it all at once.

“I’m sorry,” Vanesa said, squeezing his hand. “But I did not want it to be painful.”

Tristan swallowed, lips dry as he tried to find anything at all to say. He failed. Nothing he had learned had taught him words that would be more than air.

“Poisoned. This man has been poisoned.”

The Watch physician’s flat announcement put an end to all the shouting. The courtyard had filled with trial-takers and blackcloaks, all of whom went silent at the man’s words. Ocotlan lay on the ground, past convulsions. Past anything at all: the Aztlan was dead. His limps were warped and his face twisted into a rictus, his chest covered with vomit. It must have been, Tristan thought without sympathy, an excruciatingly painful way to die. The blackcloak physician pried open his mouth and looked at his swollen, blackened tongue. The man wrinkled his nose.

“And a high dosage at that,” he added.

He looked up at the figure presiding over all this. Lieutenant Wen’s face was a cold mask of fury.

“Watchmen, arms out,” he ordered, then his gaze swept everyone else. “No one is leaving the fort until we find who did this. Everyone is to stand unarmed in the courtyard while we –”

Vanesa grabbed her crutches and rose to her feet, leaning on them heavily, and the Tianxi lieutenant trailed off. Her movements were clumsy and Tristan reached out to help her, but his hand fell short before she drew away. He bit down on words he had not found, the clack of his teeth an unhappy sensation. Yong grabbed his shoulder, as if to draw him back, but Tristan shook him off. He did not rise, though.

What would have been the point, when it had all finished before he knew anything was happening at all?

“There’s no need for that, lieutenant,” Vanesa calmly said. “I did this.”

Lieutenant Wen blinked in surprise.

“You are confessing,” he slowly said.

“Ocotlan was an animal who crippled my only son for life,” the old woman said, adjusting her broken glasses. “How many lives did he ruin before going on to boast about it? Yes, lieutenant, I confess. I confess wishing it had taken him longer to die, so he might feel but a fraction of the misery he spent his life inflicting on others.”

Lieutenant Wen reached for his own spectacles, unfolding them carefully.

“You broke sanctuary,” the watchman said. “You were told of the consequences for this.”

“Yes,” Vanesa simply said.

Wen put on his glasses and drew his pistol.

“Close your eyes,” the lieutenant said.

His tone, Tristan thought, was almost gentle.

“I am too tired to be afraid, boy,” Vanesa softly smiled. “Send me on.”

Grey eyes watched as Wen’s finger pulled the trigger. Thunder, billowing smoke.

On she went.

—

The bodies were dragged away by the blackcloaks in the silence that followed. Sick as he felt, Tristan still finished his breakfast. Starving would be of no help to the dead.

—

The mood was still gloomy when everyone began to depart. Tristan could not muster amusement at seeing Augusto and Tupoc scurry off alone, not when the memory of that last soft smile would not leave him. He forced himself to be in the here in now when their group assembled around Angharad Tredegar, who briskly introduced him to the others before they set out. They were not such a small group, numbering eight: himself, Tredegar, Song , Zenzel, Yaretzi, Isabel Ruesta and at last the pair he did not intend to ever leave this island.

The Dove Shrine was not empty when they entered it, to the visible surprise of the others.

“We did not bargain for Tristan’s crossing,” Tredegar reminded them. “Only our own.”

The scavenger god awaiting them looked like a bird made of folded paper, rather different to the grandiose shrine around it. It smacked of pretentiousness to the rat, a Murk god putting on a Mane’s raiment.

“Supplicant,” the god said. “You enter the shrine of-”

Irritation flared. He had heard of this shrine’s test from four different mouths, there was no surprise to be had.

“Shall we get on with your tile game?” Tristan cut in. “Lady Ruesta, I will have to borrow your stick if you do not mind.”

The infanzona hesitantly nodded, and when Tristan turned his gaze back to the god he saw it was staring at him as balefully as a pile of folded paper could.

“Shall we establish the terms?” he prompted.

A long moment passed, then the air picked up and a sudden cold wind blew through the shrine. It was strong enough to force him to shield his eyes, and when he looked again the god was gone from its perch.  Lord Remund choked and Lord Zenzele began snickering.

“Must have been something you said,” the Malani opined.

“I shall work on my manners, then,” Tristan flatly said.

He was in no jesting mood, not after the morning they’d left behind.

–

It was all little more than brisk exercise until they reached the waterway.

Tristan was thankful it was only waist-deep as he was a middling swimmer. It would have been dangerous to swim by the Quays, where so many ships docked, and the waters of the canals that reached into the Murk were poisonously filthy. The sewers only reached into Estebra District and the outskirts of Feria, so everyone else dumped their waste into the canals. It was Abuela who’d taught him when he was thirteen, taking him to the Old Town for it. He’d swum little since learning, so it was almost nostalgic to be wading through water again. The nostalgia was soon replaced by irritation, for it was a long trek and exhausting on the body. It was a relief when they emerged from the waterway into a spread of luminous pools. The place was beautiful to behold, Tristan thought, though the others seemed indifferent.

They had already come this way several times.

“Stick to the sides,” Song told him. “The pools get deep.”

The thief nodded, dutifully following behind the Tianxi. She’d been at the front with Tredegar for most of the journey but had drifted to the back since they got into the water.

“I hear you were the one to find the way forward from here,” he idly said.

Silver eyes turned on him. Song, he thought, was looking at him like someone from the Guardia would. Deciding whether or not to punish him, without a speck of doubt in her that she could if she decided to. That was rather interesting, considering that though the Tianxi was Tredegar’s effective second it did not actually lend her much authority over the rest of the group.

“Sarai did mention you’re a gossip,” she said.

Uncalled for. He was spy, not a gossip. The legwork of both occupations just happened to be largely identical.

“Sarai,” he repeated. “Is that what you call her?”

Silver eyes narrowed in surprise and like that he had his answer. You know her real name, he thought. What kind of a bargain is it that you two struck with the Watch? Not that he was able to castigate over such a thing after the deal he’d made with Lieutenant Wen. Song leaned in close.

“I would advise against trying your luck too often around me, Tristan,” she said.

Tristan stilled, ripping surprise and worry off his face. That wording, had it been an accident? That Song’s contract had to do with those unsettling eyes was not in doubt, but what could she see? The Tianxi considered him a moment, then smiled.

“That’s better,” she said. “Maryam took a liking to you, having been cursed with terrible taste by her northern gods, so let us not be uncivil.”

Tristan forced a smile.

“That sounds lovely,” he said.

How much did she know? She was wary of him, unlikely to let anything slip, but the others had been in her presence longer. Some of them since the Trial of Lines. If he struck a conversation with-

“You are thinking of digging around me, right now,” Song stated. “Your misapprehension lies in thinking I care enough about you to make trouble.”

Tristan blinked, feigning surprise.

“I do not know-”

Song smiled.

“But if you were to keep digging, Tristan,” she said, “then I would be forced to care. And to hit you with your very own shovel hard enough you’d spit out teeth.”

That had, he would admit, the benefit of being exceedingly clear.

“Fair,” he conceded, dropping the theatre. “You can’t blame a man for being curious.”

Song beamed.

“I can and will.”

She patted his shoulder and turned away, resuming the march around the side of the pool. A low whistle came out from behind him, Fortuna swimming a lazy sidestroke in the pool. The dress, following in her wake, looked like trails of blood.

“That was a thorough spanking,” the Lady of Long Odds informed him, like he’d somehow been unaware. “There are places in Sacromonte where they’d make you pay for a bottom that red.”

He faked a cough, covering his mouth.

“You look like a drowning victim,” he shot back.

Her offended shouting almost made wading through the rest of the pools tolerable.

—

Being forewarned took the fear out of the creature jumping out when they shimmied across the ledge, and the strange mechanical temple they crossed afterwards – where he’d heard Inyoni had died – was empty. There had been some tension in the crew when they approached, but it bled out when the temple’s god showed no sign of being present. Angharad Tredegar ended up at his side as they passed through. She was, he suspected, trying to avoid Lord Zenzele. Guilt was a tireless workhorse.

“It sounds like the most trying of the tests anyone has encountered,” he said, casting a look around. “That could at all be won, at least.”

The one that had nearly killed Yong when he still ran with the Ramayans did not seem at all feasible to win.

“The spirit of this place was scrupulously fair,” Tredegar admitted. “Ruthless, but fair.”

“A god died here,” Fortuna told him, walking on his other side as she inspected the ceiling. “Some years ago. It cannot be seen yet, but the temple is falling apart.”

Tristan almost frowned. Then who had given out the test?

“I have never heard of a god of machines before,” he idly said, going fishing. “It must have looked rather strange, no?”

“Brass and bronze, as you would expect,” Tredegar said. “It voice was… unpleasant. Still, it was not the-”

She held back, shaking her head.

“Not the?” Tristan prompted.

“You will think me superstitious,” the Pereduri said.

“When being wary of a maze full of dying gods?” Tristan said. “Hardly.”

The tall woman bit her lip, then sighed.

“I thought I saw something inside it, for a moment,” she said. “Teeth and a swallowing throat.”

The thief’s heart skipped a beat. The Red Maw? But the god here had given out a test. Zenzele Duma was a victor. Why would the prisoner of this maze help someone cross it?

“That is certainly unusual,” he slowly said.

“I thought it only exhaustion,” Tredegar admitted, “but then I saw something similar the following day when facing the spirit of crystal hall.”

Fear pooled in his belly.

“Oh?” he said. “Any time beyond that?”

She shook her head.

“The peacock spirit in the fortress gave me no such impression,” she said. “Perhaps because she was once a greater spirit’s mount.”

That’s the wrong question to ponder, Tredegar, he thought. The right one is ‘what happened to the god that used to ride the peacock?’. Once could have been the Red Maw slipping in a victory, but twice, maybe thrice? Their seal is failing, he thought. And the Maw is impersonating gods so the Watch won’t notice. How much of the maze had been taken over? There was no telling, but it didn’t really matter. Now the same sacrifices meant to feed the gods keeping the Red Maw in check were instead feeding the Maw. The revelation killed his motivation to continue speaking, so their talk died and as they left the room they parted ways when Tredegar took the vanguard again.

This was bad, Tristan thought.

A pause.

No, the rat then thought. This is good.

His bargain with Wen had always been dangerous, likely as not to result in the Watch putting a bullet in the back of his head at the end of the Third Trial even if he had broken no rules, but now he had a reason. Tristan was not going to break a priceless Antediluvian wonder because it was the price for a Watch officer to undermine another, he was doing it for the greater good! He, a concerned young man with the best intentions, had done this only to reveal the perfidious infiltration of the Red Maw. He would have gone to the blackcloaks about it, of course, but Lieutenant Vasanti had some kind of grudge against him.

Why they need only look, she had forced him to attempt something that had killed several watchmen before – no way that wasn’t on record – and he’d duly informed the heroic Lieutenant Wen of his suspicions. Tristan made a note to actually inform Lieutenant Wen of his suspicions. Maybe in front of Sergeant Mandisa, so the man would have to think twice about denying it.

So deep in thought was the thief that he did not notice they’d left the last hall of the clockwork temple until the ground under his feet became sand.

Past the temple apparently lay a great arena, whose gates they ignored in favor of broken rusty grate leading underground. Close now, by Isabel Ruesta’s description. Next came a dark and dusty crypt, and then at last the wheel room the infanzona had mentioned. Four gates set in walls of stone, a wheel at the center of the room with four spokes of brass jutting out. Each spoke went from the floor to above Tristan’s waist. From what he understood, they would need to split between the four spaces delineated by the spokes and let their weight trigger some kind of spinning mechanism that would open the gates.

They would then effectively be tossed through them likes sacks of potatoes, which had him wondering what the Antediluvians had meant this room for.

“Let us split into pairs,” Tredegar said, an order sounding like a suggestion.

That Ruesta would cling to her like a lamprey and Cozme Aflor stick with his charge were both a given. Tristan cocked an eyebrow at Lord Zenzele, who shrugged in agreement, and counted himself glad not to have been paired with Song and her too-seeing eyes. More importantly, pairing first allowed him to pick a quadrant next to Remund Cerdan’s. The moment all eight of them were spread out there was a mechanical sound beneath their feet, something shifting, and the Malani lord began to grin. Tristan caught the edge of the spoke and prepared himself.

The spinning began rather abruptly, but it was a surprise to no one. The speed picking up felt dangerous, for all that Zenzele Duma was laughing, but Tristan kept a steady eye on the situation. It was when the gates began to open that he pulled on his luck, quick and deep.

Just as the ticking began, there was a clanging sound beneath their feet and something jammed.

When force threw him forward Tristan did not fight it. He went with it, instead, and so after Remund Cerdan was torn off the spoke he hung on to topple down the half-open gate, the thief was but two heartbeats behind him. He rolled across stone and water, hearing Remund curse in front of him and Cozme Aflor shout behind, and with a wince of anticipation released the luck. A heartbeat later, just as he glimpsed how the slope they were falling down split into two, he hit a bump on the stone and bounced against the wall – where some kind of rusted metal piece jutted.

The thief swallowed a scream as it tore into his side, ripping through tunic and flesh alike.

Fuck, he swore. Remund must have gotten hurt falling and the luck counted it as an attack. That always turned the luck hard on him. It took another two minutes to finish falling all the way down, the slope mercifully slowing before he was dumped down unceremoniously on a patch of luminescent mushrooms. The younger Cerdan barely got out of the way in time, hurrying up and looking around as Tristan stayed on the mushrooms to inspect his wound. It was mercifully shallow, but a cut with rust in it had dangers beyond the immediate. He would have to clean this with alcohol as quickly as he could.

“I know this place,” Lord Remund suddenly said. “Isabel described it to me, it is where she fell last time.”

Tristan rose with a wince. They were on a fairly narrow strip of stone, one side covered by a wall and the other leading to gaping pit. By the coolness of the air coming up, it must have been abyssally deep. In front of them, at the end of the strip, lay a narrow gap in a wall of natural stone. They would have to squeeze through.

“The rest of the path to the crystal hall is simple,” the Cerdan continued. “We should soon be there.”

“Good news,” Tristan said.

He picked up his tricorn from the floor, brushing it off and setting it on his head. When he turned, he saw that the other man’s eyes were on his wound. The infanzon’s gaze grew dismissive at the sight.

“I know the way from here,” Lord Remund Cerdan said. “You need only listen and follow me.”

Tristan nodded respectfully.

“As you say, my lord.”

Satisfied with the show of obedience, the infanzon turned – and in the heartbeat that followed, Tristan had his blackjack in hand. It would have been easiest to hit the back of the man’s head, to knock him out, but that was not what the thief was after.

Instead he struck the back of Remund’s knee.

The infanzon dropped, shouting in pain and surprise as he twisted to face his attacker, while Tristan placed his next blow. Remund’s wrist cracked at the blow, the sword he was trying to unsheathe dropping. The thief kicked it away.

“What are you-” the Cerdan shouted, fingers tracing a circle of light in the air.

Ah, the famous contract. A useful trick, but the several descriptions that Tristan had been given revealed a weakness: he kicked Remund in the face, foot right in the chin, and the shining light winked out. The Cerdan needed to concentrate to maintain the light, that much had been made abundantly clear.

Maybe if Remund Cerdan had practiced his own tolerance to pain instead of burning servants, a kick would not have been enough to disrupt his concentration.

The infanzon crawled away blindly, pushing back with his legs like an upended crab, but Tristan could muster no pity at the sight. Not for a Cerdan. He calmly pursued, stomping down on the knee he’d already struck. The hit delivered a most satisfying crack and the infanzon let out a sob of pain. He kept crawling away, Tristan following with an amused look on his face: the man had not yet realized he was heading towards the edge of the cliff. When he finally did, his mangled leg dangling over the edge, he let out a scream of terror as he clawed at the stone to avoid falling.

“Please,” Remund said. “I don’t know how much my brother paid you, but I can double it.”

“Remund Cerdan,” the thief said. “I have questions for you.”

“Yes,” the infanzon hurriedly replied. “Anything.”

“Theogony,” he said. “Does the word mean anything to you?”

A flicker of surprise in his eyes.

“No,” Remund said, “I never-”

Tristan kicked him in the leg. The infanzon shrieked in fear, trying to catch his boot as he was halfway pushed off the ledge. The thief was too nimble, though, and Remund was forced to claw at the cavern floor so that his dangling legs would not drag him down into the dark.

“Yes,” Remund screamed. “I’ve heard of it. It’s some sort of grand design by Uncle Lorent, Lord Cerdan has poured a fortune into it.”

“And it is still happening?” Tristan pressed.

The infanzon nodded, eyes wild. He tried to drag himself further up on solid ground but went still as Tristan drew his pistol. He watched in fear as the thief filled the muzzle with powder and added the lead ball. As Tristan had thought, the horror had not ceased when the Cerdans shut down their warehouses in Feria District. They’d just moved elsewhere.

“Lauriana Ceret,” he said. “Do you know the name?”

Remund blinked.

“Professor Ceret?” he asked. “Our mathematics tutor?”

Tristan’s jaw clenched. A tutor. That woman, after everything, was allowed to teach children? Rage came, but it was cold. Patient. He had waited years for the List and would wait years more.

“Ceferin,” he forced out. “How about him?”

Remund fervently shook his head and Tristan believed him. Ceferin had worked with House Cerdan for his own reasons, he had not seemed one of theirs. Their leash on him had been loose.

“You were part of it weren’t you?” Remund asked. “Whatever it was that went so bad in Feria District that Uncle Lorent went abroad for three years.”

The infanzon swallowed.

“What did they do to you?”

Tristan took a step closer. The other flinched.

“Do you know what happens when a man makes two contracts?” he asked.

Remund licked his lips.

“They go mad and die,” he said. “The gods eat them from the inside.”

“What if it were three instead?” Tristan asked. “Four, five?”

The infanzon swallowed.

“I don’t know,” he said.

“Neither did they,” Tristan replied. “So they tried.”

That and worse things yet. If he’d not followed his father that day he would never have seen the horrors that lay hidden beneath Feria District, the butchery the Cerdans were willing to commit to close the gap with the Six.

“I never had anything to do with it,” Remund told him. “I swear. Even the old warehouses in Feria, it’s Augusto who runs them! Him, Tristan, not me. Let me up and I will help you, he is no brother of-”

The thief took a step closer. The infanzon screamed, fear indistinguishable from fury.

“Why?” he demanded. “I have done nothing to you, nothing to deserve this.”

He levelled the pistol.

“Think of it,” Tristan mildly said, “as interest on the debt.”

He was a poor shot but from this close not even he could miss. And as the shot dimly echoed across the cavern, Tristan Abrascal smiled.

Two, he counted.

Halfway there.

# Chapter 33

They waited for the two as long as they could, but neither Remund Cerdan nor Tristan ever made an appearance. As the hours passed, the company grew restless.

“It has been too long,” Lord Zenzele finally said. “Either they went back or they are dead.”

“Surely,” Isabel said, “we could wait a little longer.”

The dark-haired beauty had grown increasingly distressed as time went by. Angharad felt for her: of the two boys she had come with, one had proved a villain and the other was now likely dead. Master Cozme insisted they stay longer where they stood, at the beginning of the broken mirror hall, he found no allies in this save for a hesitant Isabel.

“No one claims that the two of you cannot wait for Lord Remund,” Yaretzi tactfully said. “That is your choice to make. That does not mean it needs to be ours.”

A snort.

“He was a bit of a prick, your man,” Lord Zenzele noted. “Shame about Tristan, but the maze is a deadly place. Staying safe in the Old Fort did not prepare him, for all the stories about the heliodoran beast.”

“Are you so eager to abandon one of us?” Cozme angrily said. “What do I ask of you save time?”

“My patience, increasingly,” the Malani lord retorted.

Angharad, though part of her wished to wait – it shamed her to have invited Tristan only to lose him the very first day – had to step in.

“It will take hours to scale the crystals,” Angharad said. “My apologies, Master Cozme, but if we want to make it to the temple for the night we can no longer delay.”

The older man pulled at his mustache angrily but did not argue. He could tell when a battle was lost. Isabel’s attempt to comfort him was fended off brusquely enough it earned a raised eyebrow from Angharad. Allowances must be made for grief, she told herself, even though it was not certain that Lord Remund was dead. She was not sure how to feel about that, truth be told. The youngest Cerdan had been no friend of hers, but she had not wished him dead.

It made no difference, either way: be he dead or alive, Angharad was still bound by her oath to him not to seek the company of Isabel Ruesta.

Straightening her waning attention, Angharad opened her pack to begin setting out the equipment obtained from the Watch last eve. The sooner they reached the temple, the better. Much as it had her wary to sleep where Aines had been murdered, there was no other choice. It was the best way to remain close to the gate that would lead them back to the fortress-temple and through it the last stretch before the gate – what Lady Ferranda had called the ‘Toll Road’. Still, only a fool would forget the killing that had taken place. It had been decided that all would share a single room and two people would always be on watch.

Though they had carefully prepared for the journey traversing the broken hall was still difficult.

The crystals had always been sharp-edged and only grown more so since shattering into pieces, even small shards proving as dangerous as caltrops – they went right through leather boots, as Yaretzi learned to her dismay. The Izcalli was only lightly wounded but seeing her wince constantly had them all twice as wary. Still, their ropes, grappling hooks and gloves proved sufficient for the work. Though it was hard on the less fit of them to do so, Angharad took them up to sections of the collapsed ceiling whenever she could – it was usually in a fair state and following them let the company cross more quickly.

It still took two hours, longer than the hall had taken when inhabited by a spirit, and everyone was drenched in sweat by the end. Past the eerie cavern and the gauntlet of gargoyles the temple still waited: and just as Angharad had expected, the others had beaten them to it. After waiting so long for Remund and Tristan that had been a given. Everyone was upstairs, on the fourth level, though they were avoiding where Aines’ body had been found. The room where her body must still wait – half-heartedly entombed for lack of wood to burn her with – still had the door closed.

Everyone’s gaze seemed to avoid it, as if by unspoken accord.

Ripping right through the gloomy mood hanging around the crowd, the devil ever dogging Angharad’s steps was the first to greet her.

“Fashionably late to the party, Lady Tredegar,” Tupoc called out. “And missing a few friends, I see.”

As if there could ever be something fashionable about lateness. Izcalli.

Tupoc was sitting on the stairs, his segmented spear assembled and resting against his shoulder. His grin was as arrogant as his earrings, but the detail told. He is expecting trouble. Perhaps not without reason. Save for Augusto Cerdan, whose dark eyes never left her, everyone was giving him a wide berth. Lord Ishaan and Shalini kept to their corner while Lady Ferranda and Brun kept to another – Zenzele immediately went to join them, to a pang of discomfort from her – and Lan kept company with Lady Acanthe. Now that the shrines they had triumphed over were past and there was only one way forward, the short-lived reunion of the crews came at an unceremonious end.

Though she recognized Tupoc’s words as a taunt, honor compelled Angharad to share information of import to all trial-takers.

“Remund Cerdan and Tristan are missing,” she acknowledged. “Their condition is unknown to me.”

Some muttering at that. Remund had few friends, but Tristan was a physician’s apprentice and that had great value this far from the Old Fort. One noise broke through all the rest, however: Augusto Cerdan was laughing. He kept on even as every other soul went silent, until he was wheezing and out of breath. Tugging at his collar, the ruined face of the infanzon split into a smile.

“Cozme,” he happily said. “All is forgiven. You may return to my side.”

The older man did not move, but his gaze found the last of the Cerdan brothers. There was a look to those eyes Angharad had never seen there before: cool, almost calculating.

“So long as your brother lives, I am in his service,” Cozme Aflor finally said.

Angharad’s heart clenched with dismay. Surely Master Cozme could be implying he could ever return to Augusto’s side? It must have been politeness to a man he had once served, nothing more. Interruption came from another.

“Missing does not always mean dead,” Lord Ishaan said, stepping forward “Perhaps they will come in the night. Until then, shall we all agree to a truce?”

Tupoc laughed, tapping the haft of his spear against his shoulder.

“We, Nair?” he said. “Who is it ‘we’ you claim speak for?”

“The two of us,” Shalini said, joining her companion.

“A thronging multitude indeed,” Tupoc drawled. “Let all tremble before the mighty legions of Ramaya – tell me, which is the van and which the rearguard?”

Shalini eyed him a moment, the short and curvy gunslinger finally let out a chuckle. She spat to the side and drew a pistol.

“Did it ever occur to you, Tupoc,” she said, “that you are running out of warm bodies to throw between you and harm? Keep flapping that mouth and I might just decide to fill it with something even you will find hard to swallow.”

The Izcalli raised an eyebrow.

“Threats?” he said. “And here I thought your master was seeking a truce.”

“Yeah,” Shalini smiled. “Hide behind a truce again. That’s your favorite trick, isn’t it? I looked forward to being in the room when it finally fails you. That’ll be worth a laugh.”

The pistol the Someshwari – Ramayan in particular, Angharad supposed – held was no idle threat. From what Angharad had glimpsed, the gunslinger might genuinely be able to kill Tupoc. And once the thought was there, it did not leave. Shalini was right, she thought. Tupoc had gone on this long without paying for his deeds because he had made himself too much trouble to dig out, but was that still true? Ocotlan was dead. So were his two unlucky conscripts, Felis and Aines. The Izcalli’s strength had dwindled.

Now all that Tupoc had left was his spear and the glow of the bridges he had burned: Angharad had been patient long enough.

“Lady Tredegar?” Shalini pressed. “You word on the truce?”

“I cannot agree to one,” Angharad said.

Surprise on the Someshwari’s face, a flicker of betrayal.

“Not yet,” Angharad evenly said.

She slowly unsheathed her blade as she turned towards Tupoc and his last companion.

“Twice now you have avoided answering for your deeds, Augusto Cerdan,” the Pereduri said. “Must I strike you across the face again, or will you finally defend your honor sword in hand?”

A shiver went through the air. No one spoke, no one moved. Augusto’s face – mangled by misadventure, now a mass of bruises and ripped skin – tightened with fear. He rose, taking half a step up the stairs. Then Tupoc rose, letting out a sigh, and tapped his spear against his shoulder.

“Picking on poor Augusto again?” he drawled. “Now now, we can’t have that.”

“We?” Angharad gently echoed. “Who is this ‘we’ you claim to speak for?”

Tupoc looked around and saw the same thing she did: how the sheep that once feared him were now boldly growing the fangs of wolves. The noblewoman thought she could tell the very moment it sunk in that he had at last overplayed his hand – his grin was just a little too stiff, his eyes just a little too wide.

“Stand aside, Tupoc Xical,” Angharad calmly said. “Or else I will cut you down.”

And the illusion shattered. His power had no longer been rooted in truth, only on inertia from a time it had been. It had been a bluff, and Angharad had just called it.

A heartbeat later Song was at her side. Her musket was casually levelled forward. A bark of hard laughter followed, then the sound of a blade leaving the sheath. Lord Zenzele was on his feet, eyes burning with something like hate.

“And she won’t be alone. Do it, Xical,” Zenzele Duma said. “Please, give me a reason.”

“You already have one, Duma,” Tupoc amiably replied. “You are simply too craven to use it.”

The Izcalli’s eyes were only half on them, she saw. He was measuring distances and angles, the same way she would. Seeing if the fight was at all feasible.

“We need to calm down,” Isabel said. “Surely we-”

“Do shut your fucking mouth, Isabel,” Lady Ferranda mildly replied, drawing her own sword. “Passengers don’t get a say, and this has been a long time coming.”

The dark-haired beauty flinched away and though Angharad’s instinct was to intervene she pushed it down. She could console Isabel afterwards, when the peril had passed. Meanwhile Ferranda moved to stand by Zenzele, tacitly picking her side. Only a handful now remained uncommitted. Brun, watching it all uneasily with a hand on his hatchet, Ishaan and Shalini still holding back, Lady Acanthe reaching for her pistol with fear on her face while Lan and Yaretzi retreated and-

“This is madness.”

Angharad’s fingers tightened around her saber’s grip until the leather creaked and her knuckles turned white. Master Cozme, pistol in hand, moved between her and Augusto. He did not point the gun at her, but by the way the muzzle had yet to point down the pistol must be loaded. His decision was clear: Augusto had called and he had come. The traitor. The filthy, treacherous rat.

“Are we to have a battle before we even take on the tests of the temple-fortress?” Cozme Aflor challenged them. “How many dead, how many wounded can we-”

Halfway through the sentence, he froze. His eyes rolled up into the back of his head and he dropped in a sprawl, pistol clattering against the floor. He was still breathing, she saw, merely unconscious. A sigh drew Angharad’s eyes as Lord Ishaan, scar pulling at his lip, rubbed his forehead.

“That is going to give me such a headache,” Ishaan Nair complained.

Shalini snorted, then drew the pistol she’d been fondling.

“That’s us picking a side, folks,” the Someshwari smiled. “Liking those odds, Tupoc?”

A sleeping contract, Angharad realized with a sliver of fear. Ishaan had a contract that forced sleep.

Just like the killer who had been cutting throats.

No, she thought. He was nobly born, surely he could not – from the corner of her eye, Angharad saw Augusto taking a slow step further up the stairs and she set the matter aside. He’s going to run, she thought. An honorless cur to the end. Tupoc’s pale gaze swept across the forces arrayed against him, calculating but still utterly fearless. She would have admired that, in a better man.

“I could ask you the same question, Goel,” Tupoc Xical suddenly said. “How do you like our odds of making it to the gate with enough victors?”

If he had called on mercy or decency, Angharad thought, they would have laughed at him. But instead the Izcalli had mentioned the single thing that mattered to every single person in this hallway: his words were about the Trial of Ruins.

And behind them, Angharad thought, she could hear a sound like a crack in ice.

“How many victors do we number?” Tupoc asked them all. “Best to be certain of that, before you begin killing them off, for if you lose Augusto and myself you will be down two.”

Angharad paused. She did not, in fact, know the number. Tupoc was one, she counted, and now supposedly Augusto as well. Then from her former crew there were Isabel, Zenzele and herself.  Five. The Pereduri’s gaze slid to Lord Ishaan, who cleared his throat.

“Shalini and I are victors,” he contributed.

“I am as well,” Acanthe quietly added.

Eight victors in whole, then.

Angharad heard the cracks spread across the ice, a spiderweb unfolding.

“For those of you slower on the draw,” Tupoc said, “it means we are still two short of the ten we need and there are only six potential new victors left.”

He paused.

“Shall we kill Augusto, then, and make it so that three of those six must win? Or perhaps listen to bold Zenzele and add me to the pile, make it so that it must be four instead?”

The Malani lord snarled but gave no retort.

Tupoc’s words spread like poison. Angharad was already a victor, so no matter how many tests she now beat she could not raise their numbers. Cool gazes took in those who remained uncrowned: the unconscious Master Cozme, Lady Ferranda, Song, Brun, Yaretzi and Lan. Yaretzi was a diplomat by trade, though she could defend herself, and Lan a gossip with no weapon save a knife. The others were more solid candidates, but the tests of the spirits were not always as simple as skill at arms. Two of these six passing a test, Angharad thought they could rely on. It left room for mistakes, for the traps of spirits. Three victors out of these six, while less certain, she also felt to be likely.

The trouble was what came after, she knew.

Tupoc knew it too.

“Oh, I imagine we’ll get past the temple-fortress with ten or eleven even if we have our little brawl here,” Tupoc shrugged. “Yet that still leaves the Toll Road, my friends. Would it not be a mite tedious, for a death or two there to bring us below ten right before we reach the gate?”

Angharad swallowed her pride. She could not let him slip away, not again.

“Lord Ishaan,” she said. “Would your contract work on Xical?”

Cozme was not dead. Her concerns that she might well be speaking to the man who had been slitting throats aside, if Tupoc could be incapacitated the same way there would be seven victors left after Augusto’s demise. A risk, to be sure, but one she was willing to take. The Someshwari grimaced.

“I am not sure.”

He did not offer to use his contract after that and Angharad did not ask. Being refused would only serve as a humiliation to both.

“Xical heals,” Shalini noted. “Blowing off his kneecaps should work just as well.”

But the muzzle of her pistol lowered and Angharad thought she could hear the ice break entirely. Tupoc still had enemies, those wanting to kill him, but the wind was no longer blowing the Pereduri’s way. Too many anxious faces were watching, too many moving parts.

How was it, Angharad thought, that a man almost universally despised threatening to throw away his own life kept forcing them back again and again?

Ferranda sighed, sheathing her sword, and that was the beginning of the end. Song’s musket came down, then Zenzele snarled again and strode off. Angharad did not watch them, her eyes instead staying on Augusto Cerdan. Who looked at her with fear and hatred, not even a speck of relief worming its way onto that brutalized face.

“I accept the truce until we have passed the last gate,” Angharad said. “That makes three, Lord Augusto. On my oath, there will not be a fourth.”

—

Master Cozme would not be sharing a room with them.

Even had the man been apologetic when he was kicked awake by Tupoc – which he was not – Angharad would not have suffered it. Where was the honor in returning to the side of a man who murdered his own servants and offered treachery at every turn? She could not praise loyalty when it was so blatantly unearned; no man of character would have gone back to Augusto Cerdan’s side. How had she not seen it before? It had been her own naivete that blinded her, a foolish girl taking the first offered friendly hand. What a laugh it must have been for him, tricking her like this.

Biting down on what she would admit was a healthy helping of wounded pride, she avoided Isabel as everyone dragged their packs into the room where they would stay the night. She was too angry to give the comfort that the infanzona needed, having lost a friend in Remund and then been insulted by Ferranda. Lady Villazur’s words had been unfair: Isabel, though not a fighter, was a victor. Ferrand Villazur was not, for all the secrets about the maze she had kept up her sleeve.

Being surrounded by walls had her feeling hemmed in so Angharad stepped out to breathe. The temple, for all its dangers, was lovely enough to behold: downstairs the pools and waterfalls of luminous water flowed like strands of radiance, impossibly elegant. The dark-skinned woman lay her elbows on the stone railing and bled out her anger one breath at a time. Being calm did not mean laying down the grievance, only seeing it with eyes unclouded. Angharad made herself look at the source of her anger with a calmer mien and came to her conclusion.

It was not, in the end, her place to tell Cozme Aflor where he should stand. She was not his lady or his captain. That his act was a betrayal of trust was not to be denied, however, and though honor did not obligate her to seek redress she would now consider all ties within them severed. He should be treated as a stranger of poor repute, nothing more.

A shiver went down her spine at the thought, like a single icy droplet sliding down. Angharad’s shoulders tensed as much because of the sensation as what lay beyond it – distant amusement. The Fisher, she thought, was adding another betrayal to his tally. Another string to the argument they’d had in the dark, about the worth of honor. You treated him with honor, she could almost hear the old monster say. And where did that get you, Angharad Tredegar? Tugging at her coat uncomfortably, the noblewoman pushed off the railing. Suddenly the fresh air she’d come for felt all too cold.

“- ent outside.”

Passing the pillar that had been hiding her, she saw that her room – the company’s room, for the night – was being called on. Brun was speaking with Isabel, the skin of his face still red from the fire trap he had encountered as one of Lord Ishaan’s crew. It leant him a ruddy look, like he was a woodsman from the country instead of a Sacromontan born and bred.

“And there she is,” Lady Isabel said. “You can ask her yourself.”

Brun turned and when Angharad offered him a polite nod he replied in in kind.

“You had need of me?” she asked.

“I do,” Brun agreed. “The grapevine has it that you are arranging for a common sleeping room watched over by guards.”

Angharad nodded. It was no secret. If anything, such knowledge might deter the killer from an attempt. Her heart clenched at the thought: she now had a thought as to who that killer might be, though she hesitated to pursue it without more to go on.

“It seemed a necessary precaution given our last stay here,” she continued.

“I cannot agree more,” the fair-haired man said, tone fervent. “And given Cozme Aflor’s recent… departure, would it be too forward of me to ask if I might take his place?”

Angharad hid her surprise. She glanced at Isabel, who only smiled.

“I am sure Briceida would have been glad for his return,” the dark-haired beauty said. “I have no objection.”

“I thought you had decided to stay with Lord Ishaan,” Angharad delicately said.

It had the benefit of being both true and more gracious than reminding him he had once told her he wanted nothing to do with the infanzones.

“My concerns were about the Cerdans,” Brun frankly replied.

Angharad’s face blanked. That he would be open about it in front of Isabel was rather unexpected, though the infanzona only lightly chuckled.

“I thought that might be the reason we parted ways,” she said. “It is only natural, Angharad. Our time on the Dominion opened my eyes regarding the brothers. They are… not as I believed them to be.”

Angharad felt a pang of guilt at how selfish she had been. Stewing over Cozme’s betrayal as she had, it had never occurred to her that Isabel must feel even more betrayed – she had known the brothers for years, been friends with them even before they began courting. Brun cleared his throat, drawing back her gaze.

“In the interest of honesty, Lady Angharad, I also believe myself in danger,” he said. “I appear to have been caught up in a misunderstanding, and while I understand why it happened I would rather sleep with guards for the foreseeable future.”

And that begged further questions, but Angharad held her tongue. Fresh on the heels of Master Cozme revealing his true colors, Brun’s forthrightness felt like the very breath of fresh air she had gone outside to find. He had come here with plain intentions and set out to clear the air with everyone before making a simple request. Angharad would not repay that with an inquisition.

“We are all chasing shadows, these days,” she said. “I do no begrudge anyone seeking refuge when I have set out to build one.”

Smiling she offered Brun her hand.

“Glad to have you back, even for a single night.”

He shook it, grip firm. Sleeping God, it felt good for something to finally go right.

“I shall fetch my bags, then,” Brun said. “Best not to waste any time.”

The Sacromontan made his courtesies to both, then took his leave. Isabel watched him go, an amused look on her face.

“Did I miss a jest?” Angharad asked.

“No,” the infanzona assured her. “It is only that something about our friend Brun brings to mind poetry from home. A verse by Ilaria.”

“I have heard the name before,” Angharad said. “A famous poetess from the Century of Crowns, no?”

“Ruina and Alza are her most famous works, worthy successors to the great works of the Second Empire,” Isabel conceded, “but in Sacromonte it is Pequenas Mentiras, the Little Lies, that are most beloved. It is a collection of poems she wrote during her destitute years while wandering the city.”

Angharad cocked an eyebrow.

“Now you have me curious. What verse was brought to mind?”

Isabel cleared her throat.

“To join the court of cats

is most easily done:

solemnly swear that none

ever did fall flat.”

“I do not catch the meaning,” Angharad admitted.

“Think nothing of it,” Isabel smiled. “You might say it is an old Sacromontan vice, my dear, that we ever enjoy a clever rat.”

The green-eyed infanzona laid a hand on her arm.

“Do you happen to know where Song went?” she asked. “I have not seen her since she brought her pack.”

“I did not see her leaving,” Angharad replied.

Given how close it had come to arms earlier, for the Tianxi to wander off alone when they were so clearly aligned was perhaps dangerous. Best to find her before someone else did.

“She cannot have gone far,” Angharad mused. “Still, best to make sure.”

“My thoughts exactly,” Isabel smiled.

—

Song was not particularly difficult to find because she was already looking for her.

Angharad had questions, but when the other woman gave her a meaningful look and gestured towards the plethora open doors on the floor – from where anyone could be listening – she conceded and followed her into another room. Closing the door behind her, Angharad went still as she saw that she and the Tianxi were not alone inside: leaning against the back wall were Lord Ishaan Nair and Shalini Goel. For the merest of moments she wondered if she had been betrayed again, but quickly set it aside. Song had saved her life twice, all that would have been needed for her death was for the Tianxi to do nothing at all.

“Lady Angharad,” Ishaan greeted her. “I told you, yesterday, that there was more to say. Song proved amenable to arranging a meeting.”

“If not alone,” Shalini said. “Where’s the trust, friend?”

“Somewhere around the border of Jiushen,” Song easily replied.

“I think you mean Jaldevi,” Shalini retorted without batting an eye.

Finally a reference Angharad knew the meaning of. Jiushen had been territory under the Kingdom of Cathay, the predecessor to the Republics, but been annexed by the nascent Imperial Someshwar during the wars that led to the kingdom’s shattering. Tianxia had several times tried to reclaim the region, now called Jaldevi by Someshwari, but never succeeded at holding it for more than a year. Some of the bloodiest battles in the history of Vesper had been fought in the city’s vicinity.

“Let us set that old debate aside before someone starts singing ‘The Lost Eleventh’,” Lord Ishaan advised. “I have never once seen that happen without a brawl following.”

In other circumstances Angharad might have been amused – the somewhat playful bickering between Song and Shalini often was worth a chuckle – but at the moment she was disinclined to humor. The lack of mirth on her face was plain enough that Ishaan frowned at the sight.

“Ah,” the chubby-cheeked man said. “I should have expected as much.”

“A conversation is in order,” Angharad said, “but perhaps not the one you wish for.”

Shalini frowned.

“What are you talking about?”

“I would not make wild accusations,” the noblewoman evenly replied, “but Lord Ishaan’s demonstration of his contract brings questions. Both victims were killed in their sleep, that sleep continuing longer than anything but drugs or a contract could enforce.”

She might not have made an accusation, she’d stopped shy of that, but the implication was clear. Song’s face was inscrutable, but her intentions mattered little here. Angharad was honor-bound to seek answers for Aines’ death, which had taken place under truce. Shalini was visibly furious, swelling up with anger as she bit out an answer.

“Is that how it’s going to be? We come in good faith and-”

Lord Ishaan laid a hand on her shoulder.

“It’s a fair question to ask, Shal,” he said. “Secrecy has its worth, but two people have been killed.”

The other Someshwari’s face softened at his words, though the ember of indignation still burned. Much as Angharad would have liked to believe Shalini Goel would have nothing to do with a killer, she was not certain the other woman would place such concerns above her loyalty to Ishaan.

“It’s not for you to pay for their suspicions,” Shalini replied. “We do not owe that.”

“It is not always about owing,” Ishaan Nair said.

He withdrew his hand from his companion’s shoulder, though to Angharad’s eye both seemed reluctant to break away. Lord Ishaan met her gaze plainly.

“My contract would not achieve what you describe,” he said. “Though I can daze others, even knock them unconscious, the effect is fragile – they would be awoken by pain.”

Angharad began to choose her words, but Song cleared her throat and spoke first.

“Were we inclined to doubt you,” the Tianxi delicately said, “how would you provide proof?”

How prudently phrased. Enough that not even the hotter temper of two could take offence – Song did have a knack, when she cared to use it. Ishaan grimaced, flicking a glance at Shalini. She sighed then stepped away. For a moment Angharad thought he would use his contract on her, but instead she went to fetch an ancient, dusty chamber pot from the corner.

“My god is a god of the soul,” the Someshwari lord said. “He despises impurity and drinks from pure sources only. The price he demanded for his power reflects this.”

Ishaan visibly steeled himself.

“Your coat is black,” he told Angharad.

She blinked. It was, in fact, a shade of dark green. Not even a heartbeat after speaking the words Ishaan paled and sweat beaded his brow. He convulsed, Shalini rushing at his side with the chamber pot as he began dry retching into it. It was a solid minute before he stopped, panting as he eased away from the mercifully still-empty pot. Angharad was not unfamiliar with the ploy of feigning sickness, but while retching could be faked the sweats could not.

“You cannot lie,” she said.

“I cannot knowingly speak untruth,” Ishaan corrected. “Lest it make me sick, as lying is a pollution of the soul.”

“You were sick at the beginning of the second trial,” Song noted. “Not like this, though. And Shalini claimed that it was a consequence of using your contract, not a price.”

The Tianxi seemed unimpressed at the revelation, like it was nothing noteworthy. Shalini glared.

“Have you not had enough proof?” she challenged. “Shall we ask the details of your contract now, Song Ren? Or perhaps a thing or two about your surname. Courtesies that were not given cannot be returned.”

“If I were a suspect, such talk would be in order,” Song calmly replied. “I am not. Lord Ishaan dropped a grown man in public without moving a finger and you think this does not warrant questions? Do not confuse courtesy with privilege. That is a yiwu mistake.”

Angharad looked at the Tianxi in surprise. Yiwu? She recognized the term from Republican tracts, the kind passed around dinner parties when coin was sought for the founding of new Trebian Sea trading companies. She had not thought Song such a radical.

Ishaan cleared his throat, voice rasping.

“I am no pilgrim on the Ninefold Path,” he said. “If I were to answer that question and lay bare my secrets, I would expect something in return.”

Only for all that Song had been the one to speak it was on Angharad that the nobleman’s eyes came to rest. Tempted as she was to decline, to simply allow ignorance, it remained that Aines had died under truce. Answers must be had.

“I am listening,” she said.

“An alliance for the Trial of Weeds,” Ishaan said. “Myself, Shalini and anyone you rope in.”

“And you would reveal the nature of your contract in exchange,” Angharad said.

“So long as you promise to discuss it with no one outside this room.”

Her eyes found the scar on his cheek again, what she could not help but think was a truer face of him than the chubby cheeks and amiable manners. He was pleasant and polite, Lord Ishaan Nair, but Angharad would not forget he had schemed to send Tupoc’s entire crew to their likely deaths. The Pereduri would not claim deep acquaintance of either he or Shalini, but she thought herself a passable judge of character and Shalini did not strike her as cold enough for that. Her temper and trigger finger ran hot, but she was not ruthless enough to make that decision.

Ishaan, however, she could see weighing the gains and losses before choosing death.

It was why right now Angharad was being made to consider a bargain where she would receive something she needed but did not truly want while she was to give in return something that Ishaan Nair had been angling for since they last stood in this temple. The chubby-cheeked lordling was the vulnerable one, the one exposing himself and being cornered, and yet he would still be the one to get his way. Angharad felt unpleasantly like a fish caught in a snare.

“It is not an unfair bargain,” Song opined.

A glance at her face told her the Tianxi was inclined to accept but aware it was not her decision to make. Sighing, Angharad nodded.

“Under the stated terms, I accept your bargain,” she said.

Ishaan’s shoulders loosened and he even spared a smile for Shalini. He was more nervous than I realized, she thought. In a way that was comforting.

“It is difficult to get into the functionalities of my contract without dipping into theistic metaphysics,” Ishaan said. “I do not believe either of you is schooled in the subject?”

Song cocked an eyebrow.

“And you are?” she asked.

She seemed skeptical. Angharad was not certain why, given that the Tianxi herself spoke more languages that most translators.

“Have been since the age of six,” he easily replied. “Part of the reason I chose to seek out the Watch was the possibility of joining the Peiling Society. The Savants are arguably the leading light in that field of study.”

Angharad could believe that easily enough. Peiling, Umuthi and Arthashastra – all three of the societies making up the College had strong reputations in their fields. It was a common complaint of scholars in Malan that as Circles of the Watch the three societies were allowed rights that other scholars were not, lending them an unfair edge.

“I am not learned in such matters,” Angharad freely admitted. “Why ask?”

“If you do not mind,” Ishaan said, “I would explain my contract in descriptive terms instead of the theistic mechanics.”

“You are dumbing it down for us,” Song said, sounding somewhat amused.

“Those are not the words I would use,” Ishaan serenely replied.

How precisely phrased, she smiled. The Someshwari had once caught her out, Angharad remembered, when she used exact wording around him. No wonder, if he was forced to live much the same way Angharad tried to by virtue of his contract punishing anything else.

“I do not mind,” the Pereduri said.

Song shrugged in agreement. Ishaan nodded his thanks.

“In essence, I superimpose my physical mind – as conceived by my soul – over that of a single thinking entity I target through the medium of aether,” he told them.

There was a heartbeat as silence as they both tried to make sense of what they had been told.

“He throws his mind at other people’s minds and it knocks them out,” Shalini told them. “It’s like loading a pistol with your soul and shooting at people with it.”

Song choked and Angharad rather understood the urge, having only narrowly mastered herself.

“I really wish you would stop phrasing it like that,” Ishaan said, sounding pained.

“And I really you would stop shooting your soul at people, Isha,” Shalini replied without missing a beat.

“Is that,” Angharad slowly asked, “safe?”

“To some extent,” Ishaan said. “Shalini exaggerates the risks, as my soul itself is not in danger: the ‘bullet’ in her description is a conception of my mind as conceived my soul, neither the actual soul or mind. The risk comes from when the connection when the conception of my mind attempts to overlay their own – depending on the scale of the mind being overlayed, a dangerous amount of pressure can be applied against my consciousness.”

“That is why you were in a daze after the Trial of Lines,” Song said. “You knocked out the airavatan for a few moments, but its mind was too much.”

“It was a singularly unpleasant experience,” Ishaan grimly said. “Not unlike trying to fill a bucket by squeezing a single orange until even the pulp was dry.”

Angharad almost winced. For a man who could not lie without getting sick to describe an experience as ‘singularly unpleasant’, it must have been horrifying. Shalini patted his back, then turned a cocked eyebrow on them.

“Now that we’re all friends,” the short gunslinger said, “it might be we have a few questions you would be able to answer.”

“The alliance begins only with the Third Trial,” Song pointed out.

“We no longer have any real reason to be at odds,” Ishaan retorted. “We all want to reach the gate and to live through the Trial of Weeds. We may not be allies yet, but our interests are in alignment.”

“I have yet to hear a question,” Angharad said, promising nothing.

“A trade,” Song added after. “Question for question.”

Angharad cocked an eyebrow at her but conceded easily enough. She had no intention of answering questions about her contract but had little to hide otherwise. The Someshwari agreed.

“Is it true that Brun’s contract is about sensing people?” Shalini asked.

Angharad started.

“As far as I know,” she agreed. “I am not aware of the particulars and did not ask.”

“Why ask?” Song said. “If you do not mind sharing.”

She seemed very interested. The Someshwari traded a look.

“I think him one of the likeliest to be the killer,” Ishaan admitted.

“You have never made that accusation,” Angharad said, not hiding her surprise.

“We don’t have proof,” Shalini said. “And there’d be complications.”

The Pereduri cocked an eyebrow.

“I have used my contract several times in front of others,” Ishaan elaborated. “It would be easy to turn the accusation back on me and the only reliable way to defuse them would have been repeating our previous conversation in front of everyone.”

And without getting a promise of alliance in return, Angharad thought. Yet another way Ishaan had outmaneuvered her, she suddenly realized. If such an accusation was made, now that she knew what she knew honor would compel her to defend the Someshwari from the false accusation. Her mood soured at the thought. A thought occurred, how Brun had earlier mentioned he was at the heart of a misunderstanding he feared for his life over.

Not without reason, considering Ishaan had almost sent five people out to die.

“I have been given no reason to suspect Brun,” Angharad stated. “And would take ill to something happening to him.”

“Perhaps we should first ask why they suspect him,” Song said. “Neither of them are fools, Angharad.”

Displeased but knowing the Tianxi was right, she turned an expectant gaze on the other two.

“Process of elimination,” Shalini said. “He has the only contract that can fit the deed now that we learned Tristan’s was some kind of small-scale telekinesis.”

Tristan ha a contract? Angharad kept her surprise off her face. She’d had no idea, which was somewhat humiliating given that she had attempted to recruit him. Still, there was an obvious weakness to the argument.

“Some of us could yet be hiding contracts,” she pointed out.

Ishaan conceded with a nod.

“That is true,” he said. “Which is why I still suspect it might be Yong instead.”

Angharad blinked.

“Yong?” she said.

“He keeps moving around,” Shalini said. “First he signs up with the infanzones, then Tristan and Sarai’s crew, then he comes with us and now he’s back with the Old Fort crew? He’s hiding something, and the drinking is perhaps a little too on the nose. That, and, well…”

She flicked a glance at Song. The latter sighed.

“He is a famous murderer back in Tianxia,” Song revealed. “He murdered a famous general who might have won us back Jiushen, likely at the behest of Someshwari nobles.”

“It is not a rare name,” Ishaan said. “But several times we overheard him mentioning the Battle of Diecai and he has the right age, which is suggestive.”

“He did not deny it when I called him by his moniker,” Song said.

Angharad felt sick. How many times had she spoken with a hired killer without even knowing it? Suddenly Song’s insistence that she not be alone with the man made a great deal more sense. Why the other woman had never thought to mention this before was worth discussing, she thought, if not before these two. She cleared her throat, eager to change the subject.

“Why did you refrain from using your contract on Tupoc earlier?” Angharad asked.

Ishaan sighed, passing a hand through his hair.

“His contract worries me,” he said.

“Xical seems like he heals wounds, but it must be more elaborate than that,” Shalini said. “We have it from Lan that he walked off poison and healing contracts that can mend flesh and detoxify are rare. The underlying ideas are too different.”

“More likely it is an exotic effect relating to the metaphysical concept of his Being,” Ishaan said. “Should that be the case, it would be the theistic opposite of my contract. Putting them in conflict might have… unpredictable consequences, to say the least.”

And unpredictability rarely ended in pleasantness when dealing with spirits.

“Our turn,” Shalini said. “What do you know about what the crew that stayed at the Old Fort is up to?”

Angharad blinked.

“Tristan, Sarai and Francho,” Ishaan elaborated. “Vanesa as well before her… well, you were all there.”

“Nothing,” Angharad admitted.

Shalini laughed at first, then looked skeptical. She glanced at Song, who shrugged.

“Did he not head out with your crew this morning?” she asked.

“I first invited him days ago, before the first journey out into the maze,” Angharad said. “He only now chose to take me up on the invitation.”

“Unfortunate,” Ishaan said. “We got from Lan that he made some sort of deal with the garrison, but the terms are unknown to us. That he would venture out into the maze came as a surprise and I am not sure I believe he died before reaching the mirror hall. He was a craft sort.”

Twice now they had mentioned Lan’s name as a source of information. They must be on good terms with her even though she had long been part of Tupoc’s followers. Angharad glanced curiously at Song, who nodded. She had a question then. Let her use it. The Tianxi cleared her throat.

“What was your plan with the hour- locked gates?” she asked.

Shalini snorted.

“Nothing that panned out,” she said. “Lots of wasted time.”

Ishaan shot her a look somewhere between fond and irritated.

“When exploring the fourth level,” he said, “we found that there was secret passage leading from a room – the one I claimed – to the room with the gates. When Lady Ferranda came to us with knowledge of said gates and where they lead, I saw an opportunity.”

Angharad stilled. Song leaned forward, eyes intent.

“Shalini came to visit me in the night,” Ishaan said, “and using the passage, we broke the second gate – the one assigned to you, leading back into the maze. Come morning I intended to bargain to allow you to come with our crew so long as we joined ranks.”

He was not lying. He could not without sickening.

“You broke our gate,” Angharad slowly said.

Ishaan cocked an eyebrow.

“Shalini and I used a hammer to break your gate,” he plainly stated, leaving no room for trickery.

He still did not get sick. Ferranda had lied when she claimed to have broken both gates herself. Why? Sleeping God, so many lies from so many mouths. Angharad felt like she was losing count.

“And Tupoc’s crew?” Song asked.

“Tupoc and Ocotlan were a problem,” Shalini bluntly said. “They kept protecting troublemakers so everyone stayed at odds and we couldn’t clean house. Besides, there was no guarantee everyone going that way would die. Lady Ferranda described it as a trap, not certain death.”

Angharad’s eyes moved to Ishaan, who had carefully let his companion speak for him.

“I do not know the nature of the Trial of Weeds,” he finally said. “Given an opportunity to rid us of Tupoc Xical and his second before they reached it, I judged the other potential deaths worth it.”

Angharad should have despised him for that, for it spat in the eye of what it should be to be a noble, but the feeling never came. It was, she thought, the calm in him. The lack of guilt or justifications. Looking at the scarred man now, she was reminded of Mother. The way Rhiannon Tredegar spoken, calmly and plainly, about how sometimes you had to throw a troublemaker overboard. That it might not be fair but that a captain had a responsibility to their ship and there were times were the cold call must be made. Slowly she nodded. She did not agree with Lord Ishaan, but he had been trying to steady a ship: he was not a wanton murderer, grasping for advantage. She could respect the ends, if not the means.

Song’s gaze on her felt incredulous but she paid it no mind.

“There can be no more of that, when we are allied,” she said.

He nodded. She would leave it at that, then.

“We’ve been in here too long already,” Shalini said. “It’s bound to have been noticed. I’ve got a question or two left but they can wait.”

“You two go on ahead,” Song suggested. “I still need a word with Lady Angharad.”

The pair agreed easily enough. Angharad turned an eye on the Tianxi after they made their courtesies.

“You did not warn me about Yong,” she said the moment the door closed.

“I did not know for sure until yesterday,” Song replied. “It seemed absurd to me it would be him, like running into Admiral Benedeta while out buying apples.”

No true admiral, that one, though the infamous Trebian pirate was rumored to have gathered a sizeable fleet. Angharad conceded with a grimace. It must have seemed rather implausible to run into such an infamous killer on the Bluebell.

“He must have been hiding in Sacromonte,” the Tianxi mused. “Perhaps the Republics finally found him so he now seeks refuge in the Watch.”

“Either way he cannot be trusted,” Angharad flatly said.

She had known that even before she spent months hounded across Vesper by assassins. No man who killed for coin could be trusted.

“He is no trouble of ours at the moment,” Song shrugged. “I have a more pressing concern anyhow.”

The Pereduri’s brow rose.

“About Ishaan and Shalini?”

“No,” Song said, then hesitated. “Not exactly. What they said, about a secret passage to the gate room?”

Angharad nodded. She remembered.

“I think,” Song said, “that if there was secret passage on one side of this hall, there will be one on the other.”

Angharad frowned.

“Count the pools,” the Tianxi told her. “The gargoyles, the number of rooms. It is not symmetrical – aggressively not – but the numbers on both sides of the temple always match if you consider the gate room to be the center of this temple.”

The noblewoman would freely admit having spent not a second’s thought on this or notice anything that Song was mentioning, but she saw no reason to doubt the other woman. The implication to her words was straightforward to pick up on.

“Therefore, though it will not be symmetrically placed there should be a secret passage on the other side of the temple,” Angharad summed up.

She paused.

“That is a concern. The killer could strike again using it.”

“I worry of the same. To find it, though, we might have to ask to inspect rooms already occupied,” Song warned.

There would be nothing subtle about that.

“Then let us begin with the empty ones and hope that is not necessary,” Angharad replied.

—

They were methodical about it.

Like cattle huddling together for warmth, the trial-takers had claimed the rooms nearest to the stairs leading up to the gate room. None had cared to leave the relative safety of that closeness by choosing a room too far away, afraid of being picked off, so that left the pair free reign to explore from the outer edge of the hall going inwards. Most of the rooms were identical, largely bare stone with some dusty furniture and the occasional mural, but by the third Angharad was starting to see some small variations – taller ceilings, different furniture arrangements, thicker walls.

It was once they entered the fifth room that Song suddenly stopped before setting foot past the threshold.

“Wait,” the Tianxi said. “Look at the size of the room.”

Angharad cocked her head to the side.

“It is one of the smaller ones,” she said. “In both wall and ceiling.”

“And the last one also had a larger wall than usual,” Song said. “How large would you say the space between those two rooms is?”

“Large enough for a person to move through,” Angharad replied.

She would admit to a modicum of excitement, exploring ancient ruins like Mother once had. That it was not for the honor of the High Queen but an attempt at finding a murderer muted the feeling, admittedly, but did not smother it entirely.

Much as Angharad would have liked to claim she had been the key to it all, it was all Song.

The Tianxi took a single look at the wall before humming and moving away while the noblewoman began patting it for irregularities. Thirty heartbeats later, while she tried to push in a small indent on the wall, Song let out small laugh before there was a soft clicking sound. She had been looking at the stone bedframe, where it was pressed against the wall, and pushed in a small gargoyle head. Angharad looked around for an opening and found a span of wall besides the bed was slightly jutting out.

“There,” she said.

The other woman nodded. Song tugged at the stone delicately, raising it up perpendicular to the wall until it revealed a window in the wall. There was no light inside, but there did appear to be a narrow tunnel – not tall enough to stand, only to crawl.

“Well now,” Song muttered. “See that?”

Angharad came close, lowering herself so her face was the height of the opening, and her eyes narrowed. There was a thin coating of dust on the tunnel floor, but it was not uniform: someone had crawled here before them.

“That might be our killer’s work,” she said.

“Hard to identify someone by their knees than their feet,” Song said. “And there’s no lack of other provenances for dust. Still, it should be worth a look.”

Angharad nodded her agreement. Song took in a lantern and then crawled into the tunnel while Angharad, out of a need for certainty, went back and made sure the door to the room was closed. There was no lock, so it was the best they would get.

In she went.

— Angharad soon learned that her companion being around three inches shorter and significantly less broad at the shoulders made a difference when crawling through a confined space.

Wiggling was intolerably undignified, but needs must. When the tunnel turned a corner, into the wall whose thickness had alerted them at the possibility of the passage, it thankfully broadened. It also rose, almost like steps, until the two of them found themselves above the ceiling. Though the space was still cramped above, it was now quite broad: it seemed as large as the rooms under it, almost like an attic. Song crawled to the edge and let out a noise of surprise.

“There are holes in the eyes of gargoyles,” she said. “You can look outside from here.”

Angharad joined her as best she could, pressing her face against the stone when she saw an opening. Song had spoken true: if such eyeholes continued all the way through, it would be possible to see across most of the temple by simply moving a little. Not even Lan in her hiding place would have had such a fine vantage.

“No dust here,” Angharad noted. “We cannot know if the killer noticed as well.”

“I’d think it likely,” Song replied. “Especially since-”

She was interrupted not by Angharad but by the muted sound of people talking. Both stilled for a moment, trading a look before realizing the noise came from further out. By unspoken accord they crawled closer, the voices becoming clear enough they could make out both speakers were women. They were, the Pereduri belatedly realized, getting closer to their own room. And there was more: Song called her attention to the floor ceiling beneath them, the way the lantern light touched it. If you looked from the right angle, the stone became translucent – like looking through dark glass.

They followed the voices, and when they came to rest around their room’s ceiling to peery through it became plain who they were looking at: Isabel was seated on the bed, talking to Lady Ferranda who stood facing her. Intonations were a little difficult to make out, but the words were clear.

“-rudeness,” Isabel was saying. “There is no need for us to be at odds.”

“Let us keep moving,” Angharad said, suddenly uncomfortable.

It was, she felt, rather uncouth to listen in on the private conversations of a lady. Especially one a woman had intentions for. Song looked amused but prepared to concede.

“Even if you blast your contract at me all day, it will do nothing,” Lady Ferranda said. “There is nothing for it to work with.”

Angharad stilled. Isabel had a contract? Her eyes found Song’s. The Tianxi did not look surprised. Angharad grimaced, then gestured for them to leave again. Contract or not, eavesdropping was uncalled for. This time Song shook her head. She had no intention of leaving.

The noblewoman hesitated, but ended up staying.

“Inventions do you no good,” Isabel replied. “I understand you are distressed but-”

“I’m not the Cerdans, Ruesta,” Ferranda cut in. “I’m not trying to fuck you, wounded doe eyes won’t work on me. Even less after seeing you handle them: they’re no paragons, I’ll admit, but your game was a nasty piece of work.”

“I did no such thing,” Isabel firmly replied. “If I played the diplomat, Ferranda, it was to help us all survive. We are not all our father’s favorite, allowed to cavort with foreigners and go hunting for days at a time. If peace is all I can wield, I will make the most of it.”

“Poor, harmless little Isabel,” the other woman mocked. “Did you think I wouldn’t look into you when word spread we’d share a Dominion year? A trail of boys and girls with broken hearts, not one of them with a single bad thing to say about you. Not a single one. Strange, that.”

“Now you’re flailing,” Isabel coldly replied. “Mind control is forbidden under the Iscariot Accords. It would be the end not only of myself but every soul in House Ruesta.”

Ferranda Villazur was growing unhinged, Angharad thought. First she had lied about the gates and now she threw wild accusations seemingly without a shred of proof? She had thought the blonde infanzona the most prepared for the trials, but perhaps that was the reason for this: even after all her preparations, she had suffered loss after loss.

“Yes, that did get me thinking,” Ferranda said. “Asking around too much would have brought your house down on me, but I got enough for a guess: you are, Isabel, seen through the kindest possible mirror. People see the parts they like more and those they dislike less.”

Angharad blinked. That was… possible, she supposed, though Ferranda had yet to bring so much as even a sliver of evidence. It would have been unfair to revisit every conversation she’d had with Isabel with a colder eye, but for that Angharad forced herself not to doubt wormed its way in.

“I refuse to humor this nonsense any further,” Isabel flatly said. “If you did not come to apologize, you may leave.”

“What would be your price, though?” Ferranda continued, imperturbable. “It ought to be subtle, your contract certainly is. I kept guessing and getting it wrong, I’ll admit. I only figured it out when we met again at the Old Fort, after the Trial of Lines.”

“I said,” Isabel repeated, rising to her feet, “you may leave.”

It would have felt like Angharad was witness bullying, someone picking on another, if the accusations were not so serious. If Isabel truly had such an insidious contract – which the Pereduri was not willing to believe solely on Ferranda’s word – then it would only be natural to shun her.

“You hid it well, but before someone said my name you did not recognize me,” the other infanzona chuckled. “I thought that was insane, that we were only slightly acquainted but hardly strangers, and that was when it hit me. You always pay such close attention to people’s clothes. Not only other nobles but everyone. I thought you were a snob, but there’s more to it than that.”

A pause.

“It’s what you use to tell us apart, isn’t it? Since you forget faces.”

Angharad swallowed something like horror. Sleeping God, that would be no way to live. Isabel sighed, brushing back her hair.

“It must be comforting, Ferranda, to have a story to tell yourself about how a scheming villain is responsible for all your woes,” she said. “I don’t begrudge you that, considering.”

She leaned forward.

“But we both know the truth is simpler: you started fucking the help, compounded the error by catching feelings and then got him killed when you came up with a foolish scheme to keep him around as a lover when you wed,” Isabel said. “Grieve your Sanale all you like, Ferranda, but his death was no doing of mine. Go throw your wild conspiracies at another.”

“Speak his name again,” Ferranda said, “and you will be swallowing your teeth.”

Angharad froze. Lady Ferranda had been sleeping with her hired huntsman? Her anger was raw and she had denied nothing.

“You might not survive the consequences of that,” Isabel said.

“How long do you think you can hide behind Tredegar?” Ferranda snorted. “You sunk your hooks quick and she’s soft-hearted, but she’s not a fool. She’ll figure out you’re just using her.”

“I don’t doubt she would, if that were what I was doing,” Isabel patiently replied. “She is very clever, for all the usual Malani obsessions. Not that it is any of your business, but I am quite fond of her and intend on some sweetness before we part ways. What we are not is in love, because I am not a fucking fool.”

Ferranda laughed.

“Manes, but you are ice cold,” she said, almost admiring. “I thought there would be a crack, a bit of guilt, but you might as well be a statue.”

The taller infanzona took a step forward. Isabel warily stepped back. Angharad, who had thought highly of both, clenched her jaw in confused anguish.

“I imagine it must be maddening, living in a world of strangers that all love you,” Ferranda said. “Like we are all dolls, not quite real.”

Isabel paused, then laughed incredulously.

“Oh,” she said. “So that’s what you think, what this cheap piece of theater is about. You believe that I am the killer – or what, talked someone else into killing the Tianxi twin and that poor beaten wife?”

“I’ve seen you talk with Tristan and-”

“You idiot,” Isabel chuckled, shaking her head. “If you want a killer, you should be looking at him. I do not know what he did, but after the Bluebell Beatris was afraid. And has no one else noticed that his supposed medicine cabinet carries an awful lot of poison?”

Ferranda snarled.

“Do you think I’m an idiot?” she shouted. “There is no goddamn killer, Isabel. You came to the Dominion to rid yourself of the Cerdan brothers after screwing with their heads beyond fixing, only you can’t afford the consequences. So you made up a fake murderer to blame for it so House Cerdan will not simply ignore the unspoken rules and step on the Ruesta afterwards.”

Another step forward. This time Isabel stood her ground.

“A nudge here and there, always others doing your bloody work for you,” Ferranda said. “Who’d you talk into the first kill? Yaretzi saw you sneak out of your tent when she was on watch, that night on the hill.”

“Ah, yes,” Isabel mocked. “Right before I used my magical powers to make the victims stay asleep. Losing both my maids and my sworn guard before we even began the second trial was clearly some grand scheme and not at all a series of disasters. Here, I shall do it again.”

The infanzona snapped her finger.

“How strange,” Isabel coldly said. “Here you still are, awake and your throat gone unslit.”

“I will figure out how it was done,” Ferranda said, ignoring the scathing words. “See if I don’t. And when that moment comes, Isabel, you’ll pay for every part of this.”

Face cold and dignified, the other infanzona strode to the door and ripped it open.

“Out,” she said. “Else I will scream for help.”

“This isn’t over,” Ferranda said.

“No, I suppose not,” Isabel said. “So while you are out there digging, see if you can figure something else out for me. You see, when my father bought information on the Bluebell a detail stuck out to me.”

She leaned forward.

“Do ask your good friend Yaretzi why she is about a foot shorter than she’s supposed to be, Ferranda. I am most curious as to the answer.”

Ferranda snorted, walking out, and Isabel brusquely closed the door behind her. In the wake of it all the dark-haired woman stood there alone, unaware she was being seen. The infanzona then sighed, brushing back her hair, and went to lie down on the bed. She murmured something too low to make out.

Angharad swallowed and wrenched her gaze away, avoiding Song’s silver eyes.

She had, it seemed, a great deal to think about.

# Chapter 34

As usual, Angharad Tredegar being decent proved to be very inconvenient.

Instead of the hour or so Tristan had planned on waiting until the crew began crossing the shattered hall, he had to wait more than the double. Though he never came close enough to see more than their silhouettes in the distance – too much of a risk, with Song Ren around – he caught a glimpse of them leaving and let out a breath of relief. Finally. The thief had learned patience but never learned to love it. Once they were out of sight, Tristan set about his work: finding Augusto Cerdan’s passage back to the Old Fort.

Listening to the man’s blathering had yielded a vague idea of where it should be located. Though the infanzon had been careful not to mention where the crevasse he’d fallen in actually was, he had been all too eager to boast about how quickly he had made his way through the mirror maze itself. Tristan had memorized the directions he’d allegedly gone in, significantly narrowing down the locations where the crevasse could be. It had been the part of the infanzon’s words he truly narrowed in on, only lending half an ear to the rest.

The thief’s fingers clenched. If he had listened to the rest more carefully, heard the hints, then maybe…

“Glaring at that slab of crystal won’t move it,” Fortuna advised him.

Well, certainly not now that she was sitting on it.

“You know I’m going to be climbing that,” he said.

Instead of getting out of the way as was the implied request, the goddess stretched like a cat and posed.

“I thought you’d be happier after getting to pop a Cerdan,” Fortuna said. “Is Vanesa’s last hurrah still spoiling the taste?”

Tristan’s face went blank.

“There were hints, in retrospective,” he evenly said. “Abuela was right: I let my guard down and immediately things began to slip my notice.”

Fortuna snorted.

“Yeah, because that’s what you’re torn about,” the golden-eyed goddess mocked. “Sure. You’re a tough ol’ rat, much too tough to be sad about the nice old lady that you liked offing herself.”

He gritted his teeth.

“Taunt all you like,” he said, “you can’t deny that-”

“She was already dead, Tristan,” Fortuna cut through. “She wasn’t going to get that leg amputated no matter what you said. She just couldn’t see a live worth living with one leg.”

Quicksilver anger rose, swift and blinding.

“You think I don’t know what?” he snarled. “One eye, one leg – she would lose her shop even if she went back.”

He passed a hand through his hair, anger still clenching his jaw tight.

“She had to know I’d give her the poison if she asked, Fortuna,” he said. “That I wouldn’t balk at getting rid of Ocotlan, that I’d dose it right so he died out in the maze instead of at the fucking kitchen table with everyone watching. She did it this way because she wanted to be caught.”

A part of that, he figured, must be so the blame couldn’t fall on him if it came out the poisons were his. But the greater part had been that Vanesa simply did not want to live past that morning. She had not wanted imprisonment or pain, so she had drunk the poppy and confessed to a man bearing a pistol and the duty to use it. He cursed and felt like kicking the slab of crystal even though it would do nothing but bruise his toes.

“There was no place in that decision for you to stick your nose in,” Fortuna said. “She picked her dice and rolled them – what came after that was between her and the table.”

“I am not so much of a hypocrite as to deny someone the settling of their dues,” Tristan tiredly said. “But she was worth more than an Ocotlan.”

You could find the likes of the bruiser at any tavern of the Murk: strength paired with cruelty was a coin no city ever grew poor with. Kindness, offered unstintingly to strangers? That was a rare good.

“It wasn’t an even trade, that’s all,” he murmured.

“Sometimes you just have to take the loss,” Fortuna replied, not unsympathetically.

But not, he thought, with sympathy either. She was a goddess, the Lady of Long Odds. Fortuna would never be able to see the world through anything but those lenses, and it was not in her nature to truly mourn a loss. How could she, when the bone of her was to roll the dice until that one a in a thousand victory came roaring into life? Losing taste for the conversation, Tristan opened his bag and put on the leather gloves.

He had work to do and he was already behind on the timetable.

—

It took a little under an hour to find Augusto Cerdan’s saving grace.

The search grew easier once Tristan was certain the man had lied, which given that he was dealing with an infanzon he had assumed was the case anyhow: his lordship had not gotten anywhere as far in the mirror hall as he had claimed. As the outskirts of the shattered grounds were the easiest to get around in, this proved to be a stroke of luck.

The crevasse in questions was long and thin, like a slicing wound in the earth, and half-covered by a crumpled wall. The wall had broken into pieces when a chunk of ceiling fell onto it, which made reaching a part of the crevasse broad enough to pass through simple – if exhausting – work. Tristan dragged away sharp chunks of crystal, glad for the thickness of the leather gloves, until there was room enough to see into the depths. Which were, he was somewhat amused to see, not all that deep.

Lantern light revealed the fall was only seven feet or so. It also confirmed he had the right place: he spied a stray brass button that had not a speck of dust on it, unlike the rest of the floor. Someone had recently gone through here.

Tristan lowered himself down and pocketed the button – that made three, added to the stone pair from the pillar he’d split between his pocket and his boot – before tugging the rope down after him. The space down here was a narrow crypt whose ceiling was so low he had to stay on his knees, empty tombs flanking him from both sides. After maybe thirty feet of cramped crawling, the crypt ended and there was drop into a much larger room.

Larger and rather unusual: there was nothing in there save for a bridge over dark, oily waters. The floor was paved, faded grey and yellow tiles with geometric shapes within. On the opposite side of the bridge was a closed door of a metal so worn the thief could not tell what it was.

Tristan did not have to be told to know a god dwelled here.

This must be the seat of the test Augusto Cerdan claimed to have beaten. Shimmying out of the crypt, Tristan dropped onto the tiled floor and took a moment to catch his bearings. Dusting off his shoulders the thief rose, lantern high, and cleared his throat.

“So how might one go about earning the right to cross the bridge?” Tristan called out.

Movement caught his eye. It looked like a stray dog – the same faded grey as the tiles, its eyes and teeth the same yellow – but he knew better than to believe what he saw. The god might be pretending it had been nestled against the back wall on the other side of the bridge, just now rising, but the thief would not have missed it were it truly there. The stray dog, stray god, trotted to the middle of the bridge before stopping. It lay down there, almost lazily.

“Supplicant,” the god greeted him.

Its voice, he thought, sounded like a brush against a tile. Like someone painting.

“God of the land,” he replied, bowing his head.

“You may take my test to earn passage,” the dog told him, “or you may pay the toll and cross.”

He cocked his head to the side.

“Your test being?”

“There are six circles hidden among the tiles,” the god said. “Find them and you may pass through here as you will.”

That, he thought, sounded like one of those tests that would be much harder than they seemed.

“And the toll?”

The dog opened its maw happily, the teeth – yellow but in a way that defied the description of dirty, too uniform in color and perfectly formed – it showed licked by a grey tongue.

“I need paint,” the god. “Fresh paint. The colors fade.”

Tristan was not a fool.

“You want my blood,” he stated.

“Three drops,” the dog god said. “You smell of an interesting life. Your hue will not soon fade.”

The thief swallowed.

“The man who came here before me,” Tristan said. “He paid the toll, didn’t he?”

The dog nodded. The thief mentally tipped his hat to Augusto Cerdan – he had, in truth, been more inclined to believe the infanzon a victor than not. It ought to be amusing to find out how long he’d kept up the lie around the maze crew.

“It was shallow paint,” the god said. “Too much of the same, easily yellowed. Yours will be a grey, I think. That always takes time.”

Giving a god blood was not as dangerous as the faint-hearted assumed. Tristan had done so infrequently to the Rat King when offering prayer and twice to the Capricious Bones when he’d had to swim near the bottom of the canals in the Old Town – the Mane was a vicious thing and not above snatching those that dwelled near the depths it claimed as its domain. Besides, Augusto Cerdan had not visibly taken ill from paying the toll. Tristan, however, knew things about this maze that the infanzon did not.

“Is it him?” he asked.

It was not the stray dog he was addressing. Fortuna stepped past him, fanning herself as she glared at the god on the bridge.

“It is utterly deplorable manners,” she sneered, “to defile a remnant in this way. A god of your age should know better.”

The dog lazily turned to look at her. Directly at her, Tristan saw. As if it could see her standing there.

And then it changed.

Its skin bubbled and melted, peeling away in chunks. Thd heard warped, grey and yellow bending and blurring until a wet redness squelched out – coming back together into a shape that was like a hound’s heard traced in tendrils of red, grinning wetly. The sight had him shivering in disgust, the inherent wrongness of what he beheld repellent beyond what words could express.

“A stray thing that does not know when to die,” the Red Maw said, and laughed.

Tristan’s limbs were shaking. He almost fell to his knees. That voice, that… no, it hadn’t been a voice. It had been like a mouth against his ear, sucking out the wetness inside his skull and feeding upon it. He could feel it still, a susurrant disease lingering inside his brains. The thief convulsed, but it was not his stomach that wanted to throw up – it was his soul.

“You have decayed,” Fortuna said, and her voice like was fresh water at the height of summer.

Tristan, only now realizing he was on his knees, let out a gasp. He had been drowning on air and never even known.

“There is a sickness in you, as if your very root grew out crooked,” the Lady of Long Odds mused. “Whatever is it you are a god of now it is not what you were born for.”

“The Masters are gone,” the Red Maw grinned. “I can eat my fill.”

A hand caught Tristan’s wrist. He blinked in surprised, watching his own curled fingers as Fortuna looked down at him worriedly. He had been about to claw at the side of his head, he realized. To dig and dig through the flesh, until he could rip out the poisonous warmness slithering in through his earholes like an unguarded gate.

“Focus,” she told him. “Think of a coin spinning.”

Mouth dry, gums bleeding against his ragged tongue, Tristan forced himself to see it. To hear it, feel it. The ring of gold as it spun, the glint in the light. The satisfying snap as his thumb sent it spinning. The flat sensation as it landed on his palm. He could feel himself breathe, his heartbeat fearful and steady.

“- work will not hold me,” the Red Maw said. “The Lightbringer’s bastards broke the Work but they cannot rule it. The seal will fail. I will grow and take, take, take taketaketaketa-”

The pressure built against his eardrums like he was at the bottom of the sea, drowning, and as he vainly covered his hears Tristan screamed. Screamed until his throat was raw and his lungs burning, his lips cracked.

He came to on his knees, weeping as his feverish forehead rested on the cool tile beneath.

Fortuna was stroking his back. Whispering soothingly.

“It’s all right,” the goddess said. “He’s gone now, Tristan. He left.”

“I,” Tristan croaked out, tasting copper on his cracked lips. “Gods.”

He felt like a child again, a wail welling up inside his throat in the face of the unfairness of the world.

“What did he do?” Tristan asked.

“He looked at you,” Fortuna quietly said. “All of him, just for a moment. But you didn’t crack, Tristan. Your mind held.”

The thief blubbered out something that was both relief and terror. Had he truly held? He could not tell. Could not be sure what he had been like, before that awful sound. It felt like he was stained from the inside, like there was rot he would never be rid of.

“He’s gone now?” he asked.

Begged.

“When he turned his eye on you, the gods of the maze bit at him,” Fortuna said. “Now he must bite them back. His gaze won’t return here for some time.”

Tristan forced himself to his feet. The lantern had tipped over, some oil spilling out, but he did not even try to clean it and harshly yanked it upright.

He fled across the bridge, into the deep halls, and kept fleeing all the way back to the Old Fort.

—

It was as if he’d been in a trance: Tristan, for the life of him, could not have described the path he took to return. It was a blur, a vague sense of movement and stumbling forward.

It only began to swim back into focus when he was past the shrines, on the open grounds leading to the ramparts. The steadiness of his boots against the stone helped, but the thief felt tired to his very bone. As if life had been wrung out of him. The dull ache pounding away at his skull did not help any. By the time he reached the hole in the ramparts he felt halfway like a person again, but patting away at his hair and straightening his clothes had not been enough. The watchmen on guard both raised their musket at him.

“Don’t move,” the sergeant ordered. “Hands away from your weapons.”

He flicked a glance at the Aztlan watchwoman by his side.

“Get Basset. He looks like a breach.”

The young woman saluted, throwing him a pitying glance before she left. Tristan had to blink away sleep twice, but even though he was swaying on his feet the watchman’s gun never went down. The Aztlan came back with a young Malani watchman, who was half-dressed and still blinking sleep out of his eyes. He yawned.

“This the one?”

“Do you see anyone else?” the sergeant flatly asked.

The Malani – Basset, a strange name – rolled his eyes but took a step closer. Tristan eyed him warily, especially when the other man began sniffing at him.

“Still only one contract,” Basset said. “Could have had a brush, but the scent of his spirit is so strong I can’t tell.”

A breach, the sergeant had said. They were looking to see if the Red Maw sunk its hooks in me. How tired was he, for the realization to have taken so long? The sergeant grunted, but after a heartbeat finally lowered his musket.

“You can come in,” he said. “Watch your step, rat. No one’s in a trifling mood after the debacle earlier.”

Tristan slowly nodded, pinching the inside of his own wrist when no one was looking. The pain woke him some, though it would not last long. A debacle? Something to look into when he was more awake. It was hard to tell the time, but by the looks of most lights being out it must have been night. Though more than ready to drop on his bedroll and tumble headlong into sleep, Tristan did not get the chance. One of the curtains further down was moved aside as he approached, Maryam’s head popping out. Blue eyes widened when she saw him.

Swallowing a groan, Tristan obeyed when she gestured for him to come.

The curtain fell behind him and they could hardly see each other but that did not stop her from inspecting him.

“You look half dead,” she bluntly said. “What happened to you?”

“The way back was more unpleasant than advertised,” Tristan said. “I’m dead tired, a report will have to wait. What’s this I hear about a debacle?”

Maryam grimaced.

“Lieutenant Vasanti rustled up a crew and went past the locked door,” she said. “Twenty went in, armed to the teeth. Nine came back. They drove the god away, wounded it, but they could not score a kill.”

That, the thief thought, was going to be trouble.

“What were they trying to do?”

Maryam leaned closer.

“Looking for the brand you gave Francho,” she whispered. “They went where you said and did not find it, so Vasanti flew into a rage. Had all our rooms searched while we were put under arrest.”

He closed his eyes. Tristan could almost feel a second, larger headache looming behind his current one. That assault had been reckless of the lieutenant. Why had she made her attempt now, when instead she could have reached out to her superiors to gather support? He asked Maryam, but she had no more idea than he and other news just as pressing besides.

“The brand works,” Maryam told him. “We smuggled it into the room, the one with the engine they’ve had us studying, and it reacted. We shut the device down before the guard could notice, but I bargained with Lieutenant Wen and in three hours we are going back  – Sergeant Mandisa will have the watch shift, she is to cover for us.”

Tristan almost wept. Only three hours? He needed three days, not this pittance. But he could not afford to miss Francho’s discoveries.

“I’ll be there,” he sighed.

Every ounce of his flesh felt exhausted and there was still one thing he needed to do before he could sleep.

“I’m going to need your help,” he said. “I hit a rusty piece of metal earlier. I need to clean the wound or I’m risking lockjaw.”

“That’s going to sting,” Maryam said.

He grimly nodded. They’d have to open it anew and clean it with alcohol to be sure nothing caught.

A fitting end to a bloody day.

—

It was Yong who kicked him awake.

“Up,” the Tianxi whispered. “We need to move before Vasanti’s people are back on watch.”

“Lovely to see you too,” Tristan muttered back.

He checked on his bandages before leaving, finding Maryam’s work was still held, and hastily put on his boots before following Yong. They were to be the last one in, the older man told him: Francho and Maryam were already inside. They hurried to the bastion, the blackcloaks on the walls hardly sparing them a glance, then up the ladder. A few flights of stairs later they were in the room with the aetheric machine and the stripes of cryptoglyphs on the walls. Sergeant Mandisa, Wen’s tall right hand with the easy smile and the utter lack of mercy behind it, was idling at the door. Mandisa was, Tristan had cottoned on early, one of the most dangerous people in the Old Fort.

She talked about death like someone who thought little of dealing it out.

“Ah, Tristan,” Francho toothlessly smiled. “I am glad to see you’ve returned safely to us.”

“It was a journey,” the thief mildly said. “What have you got for us, Francho?”

“I’m curious about that myself,” Sergeant Mandisa noted. “I thought brands had very specific and narrow uses. It makes more sense for it to be paired with a device on the other side of the pillar.”

“They do,” Maryam agreed. “But we can get what we need without having full run of the device.”

The man-sized machine had not changed since last saw it, the golden ally box at the top sprouting spindly levers while beneath it twelve cylinders interlocked with pistons led down into a sideways barrel with a lid of green glass. It was against that dull lid that Francho pressed the brand, and as the old man smiled excitedly light began to spread through the glass. A green glow gently pulsed and everyone’s breath caught: the old wonder had come alive.

“The machine is not truly functional at the moment,” Francho noted. “As you theorized, Sergeant Mandisa, this brand is not the right key to make it work. Thankfully for us, it appears to be resonating with a component in the barrel and the reactions buys us some measure of power.”

“And what,” Yong said, “is that power to be used for?”

“My study of cryptoglyphs is relatively shallow, I warn you,” the old professor said. “But I am fairly certain that I have identified a combination of levers that causes either ‘audit’ or ‘inspect’.”

“We tried it earlier but I cannot make the corresponding Signs so there was no reaction,” Maryam said. “It might work now, though.”

“Exciting,” Sergeant Mandisa enthused. “Go on.”

Francho glanced at Maryam, who shrugged. The sequence did not seem all that complicated to Tristan’s eye: two levers pulled down, one pulled to the side. Exactly in that order. To everyone’s disappointment, nothing happened.

Until the green glow winked out.

The machine shuddered, the gears under the golden frame grinding as the pistons interlocked with the cylinders began to move. Something flickered behind the green glass, but the light did not return. Not there, anyway: to their shared surprise colors bloomed on the wall facing the barrel’s lid. Sergeant Mandisa, who was in the way, was painted with them for a heartbeat before she moved away. Unharmed, to all their reliefs.

“I’ll be damned,” Yong said. “It actually worked.”

It had, Tristan said. Now if he only had an idea what they were looking at. It was, he thought, an eye-searing tableau of green and red. Two wobbly green shapes, one broadly and oval and the other a misshapen triangle, were filled with red tendrils that breached the edge of the shape. They waited a moment longer but nothing changed. The colors on the wall remained, occasionally sputtering dark for a second before resuming. The thief got the sense that they might be running on borrowed time. They all looked rather bemused, save for Maryam: her eyes were on the green shape to the right, unblinking.

“Sarai?” he prompted.

“That,” she said, pointing where she had been looking, “is a map of the Dominion of Lost Things. As seen from a bird’s eye view.”

Doubting her would be foolish when she had used a Sign to commit a map of the Dominion perfectly to her memory. Tristan paused, glancing at the other shape. A badly drawn triangle, he thought, unless…

“So this one is the island from the side,” he said. “As if looking through it.”

Sergeant Mandisa went still. It stood out all the more for her usual liveliness. So you know the Red Maw exists, Tristan thought. She was highly ranked enough for that.

“What is the red, then?” Yong frowned.

Tristan had not kept complete silence over the Red Maw’s existence after finding out its existence with Francho, but he had only broken it for Sarai. The Tianxi veteran was still in the dark. He’s the only one that doesn’t know, now that Vanesa is dead. Perhaps the time for secrecy was past.

“A god,” Tristan said. “One the Watch is keeping contained.”

“Failing to,” Sergeant Mandisa mildly said. “None of you are fools, so I expect that I don’t have to tell you flapping your lips will get you killed.”

The threat was so matter-of-fact it was difficult to take offense to it. Besides, Tristan was more interested by her first words: she’d noticed is as well, then. Near the back of the island, the opposite end of the island from where the Bluebell had docked, tendrils of red were breaking past the green shape representing the island. Seen from the side they curled deep below before going forward, which Tristan figured to mean that the Red Maw had begun to burrow its tendrils in the bedrock under the Trebian Sea so it could spread to other isles.

“Fascinating,” Francho muttered.

The old man was standing close to the colors on the wall, eyes shining with interest.

“What is?” Yong asked.

“Look at the pattern in the red here,” the old man said, pointing to the bird’s eye view.

Fingers traced along red furrows, the thickest of the red lines.

“See how they make up a geometric shape?” he asked.

The professor was right. Centered around the mountain they currently stood under there was a perfect hexagon of red.

“And from the tip of each emanates a slightly smaller line,” Francho continued. “That is not a natural occurrence.  Not how no other red tendril gets as large as these, even when they branch out from these artificial furrows.”

Sergeant Mandisa’s jaw clenched.

“What are we looking at, professor?” she asked.

“Antediluvian work,” he said. “I would bet my life on it.”

The Red Maw’s heart was under this pillar, Tristan knew. And now it turned out the pillar was at the center of some sort of titanic Antediluvian work, one of which the golden aetheric machine above was likely a single component instead of the culmination. The view of the island from the side only added more questions: the hexagon line were deep below the surface of the island. It was the lines emitting from the points of the geometric shape that went up towards the ground – and even then only tendrils reached close to the surface.

What did it mean? His eyes returned to the bird’s eye view, and looking at the broader hexagon lines he tried to think of all the maps he had seen before. Mostly of Sacromonte, admittedly, and… oh.

“They’re canals,” Tristan suddenly said. “The big channels, they are canals to carry something around. The god fucking everything up is supposed to be the water, the means of transportation somehow.”

His memories of the confrontation by the bridge were hazy, like the edges of it had been exposed to an open flame and curled in on themselves, but he remembered what Fortuna had said: whatever it was that the Red Maw was once meant to be, it had deviated from that root. The corruption is about the way it feeds, Tristan thought. It’s eating more than it should and that’s making it crooked somehow. Only the thief could not see how it would: all gods fed with ceaseless hunger. Even those who grew strong enough to manifest did not set aside that all-consuming desire.

So how could the Red Maw feeding be a deviation?

“That explains why the smaller red roads look so small and shoddy, then,” Yong noted. “They were built by the god, not by the Ancients.”

Tristan breathed in. It takes to grow, he thought. The Red Maw did. But what if it isn’t supposed to grow? What if the god the Antediluvians had trapped beneath their great machinery was meant to stick to the canals they had built and never spread beyond? That’s how it serves as water: it eats on one end and spits out on the other, moving life or aether or whatever the Antediluvians wanted moved. Only when the Old Night fell the Red Maw had stopped spitting out what it ate.

Now it was using that power to grow instead, to spread.

“Lieutenant Wen needs to be made aware of this,” Mandisa said. “We’re done here.”

“What will he do?” Tristan asked.

He forced nonchalance. His bargain with Wen rested on the foundation that he would break the golden machine above, so if the fat Tianxi decided that the situation was too dire to risk ending the lights he was in trouble. The tall sergeant hesitated.

“Keep to your bargain,” the dark-skinned woman finally said. “Prepare for tomorrow as planned.”

Tristan slowly nodded, wondering how much he could trust the pair. Shallowly at best, he thought. He had told Maryam of his deal with Lieutenant Wen, but not the other two – when Mandisa’s loose tongue outed if, it earned him pointed looks. He would have to give explanations, the thief thought. But not here or now.

As Mandisa had said, they were done here.

Francho took the brand away from the machine and the colors went out, the green glow returning to the lid for a few seconds before fading. Tristan’s eyes lingered on the brand. Now that he was slightly more rested, he could think of one reason why Lieutenant Vasanti would have pushed for an assault past the locked gate.

“Sergeant,” he said, catching the woman’s gaze. “I need a favor.”

It was small enough she accepted.

—

They snuck back to their rooms after that, and Tristan was all too happy to rest a little more. He closed his eyes and was asleep moments later, only to be kicked away after what must have been hours but felt like mere minutes.

“Yong,” he groaned. “Do you need to-”

“Drag him out.”

It was not Yong but two large watchmen grabbing him as the coldly furious voice had ordered. Tristan did not resist, going immediately limp. He would not win the fight and would rather face what would be coming without bruises. Fear killed every last dreg of sleep as the blackcloaks forced him to his feet and twisted his arms behind his back before pushing him forward. He stumbled, bare feet on the cold stone, and found he was being waited on.

Arrayed in the courtyard were more than two dozen watchmen, what had to be most of the remaining garrison, and none of them said a word as he was dragged to stand before them.

He quickly found who he was looking for. Lieutenant Wen was seated a kitchen table, biting into some kind pf pastry with Sergeant Mandisa standing by his side, but Tristan did not let his gaze linger. Even if it turned out they were allies, they would not show it now. Not when the source of the voice that had ordered him dragged was glaring down at him.

Lieutenant Vasanti did not look wounded, for all that she had been part of the ill-fated assault on the pillar, but she did look haggard. Her hair was in disarray, her eyes a little wild. Her anger might be cold, but it was the kind of cold that had something ugly lurking under it. The worst kind, Tristan thought. The two big blackcloaks holding him in place kept flanking him as the lieutenant scowled.

“You lied to me,” Lieutenant Vasanti said. “In your report. We reached the location you described and the brand was not there.”

A rumble of anger from the crowd. How many blackcloaks had there been in the garrison this morning – thirty, forty? If eleven had died, then everyone here had lost at least a friend. Likely more. He would get no mercy from this tribunal if things went badly for him.

“I also told you that the god was able to enter the room leading there,” the thief pointed out. “It nearly killed me in it. I made no promises that everything would still be the same.”

A loud scoff. Sergeant Olvya, he saw. Her smiled was smugly unpleasant.

“And we are to believe the god left them untouched for centuries and then suddenly changed its mind?”

“I don’t care what you believe, Olvya,” he frankly replied. “I care that I have been dragged to stand before what looks like a hanging crowd on the basis of… I can’t tell, really. Being disliked by two Watch officers?”

He paused.

“I have heard accusations but no proof,” Tristan said. “Yet I am a prisoner. Is this how the Watch handles its affairs?”

That, he saw, struck the mark. Uneasy faces. Lieutenant Wen raised an eyebrow at Vasanti. Still allies, then, Tristan thought. Wen yet had a use for him, so he should be willing to put a thumb to the scales to keep the thief alive if he could.

“You are not imprisoned,” Lieutenant Vasanti bit out.

The thief smiled pleasantly, turning his pearly teeth to the big blackcloaks holding him.

“Did you hear that, my lads?” he said. “I am not imprisoned.”

He tugged at their arms meaningfully and after they glanced at Vasanti – who snarled out a nod – they released him. They even took a few steps back. Ah, good. Now he might feasibly make a run for it, though fleeing a garrison armed with muskets when he did not even have boots on seemed… well, he’d mark that plan down as suicide with a flourish. You had to start somewhere. And now to account for the piece he’d not got eyes on – where were the others?

A glance flicked backwards showed him that armed watchmen were standing in front of the other occupied rooms. When Yong opened his curtain a musket was pointed at him and a harsh order had the Tianxi closing it. There would be no help from there.

Worse, there was another blackcloak going through his affairs and she came out with a noise of triumph. The watchman was, he saw, holding a button in her hand. A stone button, one of those that could serve as a key to the locked door in the pillar. Probably the one in my coat, he decided. The one in his boot was well-hidden.

“Found it, ma’am,” she called out. “He has a key, like you said.”

“And there we are,” Lieutenant Vasanti smilingly said. “Evidence, as you requested. You had a way to get in there and take the brand.”

Tristan smiled pleasantly back, then looked at the watchwoman.

“You, going through my things,” he called out. “What’s your name?”

The blackcloaks blinked at him in surprise.

“Er,” she said. “Dulcia?”

“Dulcia,” he repeated. “While you’re still in there, do you happen to see the brand?”

A moment of silence.

“No,” Dulcia conceded.

Tristan turned his gaze back to Lieutenant Vasanti.

“Fancy that,” he said.

She snorted.

“So you hid it somewhere else,” Vasanti said.

“I could have done that, yes,” Tristan easily said. “I could also be the King of Izcalli. Are we dragging people out of their beds in the middle of the night for coulds now, lieutenant?”

Wen bit into his pastry, which was more than halfway finished, and loudly swallowed. There were flakes all over his chin.

“He’s not wrong,” the Tianxi lieutenant said. “You have a key too, Vasanti. How close of an eye did you keep on it?”

The old woman turned on the other officer, face twisted with anger.

“Are you implying one of us did this?”

“I am stating that anyone could have used your key, or his for that matter,” Lieutenant Wen evenly replied. “You want us to execute a trial-taker on grounds this thin? We’ll all answer to Commander Artal for it.

He paused.

“Unless you’re asking for us to send falsified reports about the whole business,” Wen said. “Is that the case?”

“Of course not,” Vasanti said.

A little too quickly.

“Then make a better case,” the Tianxi advised. “I’m not getting another black mark on my record just because you want to pin the blame for today’s fuckup on some Sacromonte rat.”

That had hard eyes turned on her, but it did not last.

“Eleven of us died, Wen,” Lieutenant Vasanti said. “Now you want to let the only person with answers walk away?”

The mood, which had been going Wen’s way, turned sharply back her way. Vasanti wasn’t leaning on reason, Tristan thought. She was using anger, and anger always got a bite. Most of the people here must already have black marks on their record to have gotten this assignment in the first place, he thought. It’s not as strong a deterrent for them.

“Don’t go putting words in my mouth,” Wen dismissed. “You want answers? By all means, get them. But this playacting is wasting everyone’s time. By morning either we’ll have a legitimate reason to put a bullet in his skull or we’ll have to let him take the trial.”

A pause.

“So are you going to drag him in a corner for a real interrogation,” the Tianxi said, “or are you going keep pissing away my good night’s sleep pretending you’re some kind of magistrate?”

Lieutenant Vasanti glared at the other officer, but she saw the same thing Tristan did: Wen had convinced them. The Watch was not a mob or a coterie, it had rules – and Vasanti had not given them good enough a reason to break them, not when there was a way to get answers that wouldn’t get their superiors coming down on their heads. This was, Tristan thought, the best Wen could do for him.

Getting him out was simply not in the cards, not with this many angry souls out for a scapegoat, so what the Tianxi could offer was to get him away from the mob. To put him in a room with only a few, where he could wheel and deal behind closed doors.

A swell of gratitude, barely marred by the fact that Wen had essentially just suggested he be tortured for answers.

“Fine,” the old Someshwari hissed. “If you don’t care enough to get answers for the dead, I will.”

“Oh, Vasanti,” Lieutenant Wen mildly said, “I do care. Unlike you, I knew their names. It’s why when Commander Artal has you shot for getting more of us killed against his explicit orders, I’ll be sitting in that room with another of these pastries.”

The fat Tianxi smiled, swallowing the last piece and licking his fingers.

“And I’m sure it will taste delicious.”

Tristan never met his eyes, did not even look at him, but in his mind’s eye he thanked Wen for this last gift.

He’d just been told something that might save his life.

—

The fist dug deep in his belly and Tristan folded, throwing up all over the floor.

It was not the worst beating he’d ever had. The watchmen were professional about it, hitting places where the damage would not be permanent and measuring their strength carefully. He would hurt, he would bruise, but there would be no broken bones or hidden bleeding.

“Back in the chair,” Lieutenant Vasanti ordered.

They forced him back up even as his stomach trembled and bile rose.

“A little to the left,” Fortuna whispered into his ear.

He followed her suggestion when he threw up again, drenching the legs of the watchman most satisfyingly. The man cursed and shoved him into the chair, backing away. The other one laughed, pulling up Tristan’s chin so he was facing Lieutenant Vasanti. The old Someshwari’s gaze was cold, unmoved by the sight of the violence she’d ordered.

“Where is the brand, Tristan?” she asked.

“Are you familiar with the poetess Iliria’s works?” the rat asked.

“Again,” Vasanti said.

The blackcloak who’d pulled his chin up slapped him, open-palmed. His cheeks were so red by now he barely felt it. They would rotate back to his inner thighs soon.

“Where is the brand, Tristan?” Lieutenant Vasanti asked.

“There’s this poem in her Little Lies,” he said. “The Court of Cats.”

The Someshwari sighed.

“Choke him.”

The big man seized him by the throat, toppling the chair, and he smacked against the wall. Fingers like sausages squeezed as he tried to breathe. Tristan went into himself, eyes unseeing. He thought of the grave he was in, the shape of it. The feel of the stone under his fingers, the coolness. How his feet pushed against the bottom, how he would have to fold his legs to get out.

“-enough, he’ll die.”

Tristan gasped, air flooding back into his lungs, and began to cough. The blackcloak he’d thrown up on looked at him carefully, then drew back.

“He’s fine.”

Lieutenant Vasanti leaned forward.

“Where is the brand, Tristan?”

“So the second verse,” he rasped. “It goes like this-”

The fingers went back around his throat, not even needing an order.

“To leave the court of cats

is even simpler done,” he got out before the squeeze.

He gasped blindly, trying to breathe through the grip.

“Stop,” Vasanti said. “Let him finish.”

He croaked out a broken laugh when the fingers released him.

“For when their hunger comes

rats are ever sport.”

A long moment of silence.

“Give me the room,” the lieutenant said. “I know what will make him crack.”

Liar, Tristan thought, smiling a bloodied smile. The pair of toughs – for that was all they were, regardless of the color of their cloak – traded surprised glances but obeyed their superior. The door closed on the small dark room, the only lantern lit casting its flickering glare between the two of them.

“I catch your drift. You want assurances I won’t kill you when I have the brand,” Vasanti said. “Why should I even believe you know where it is?”

“Because you want to,” Tristan rasped. “Getting your hands on it is the only way you’re living through the month.”

The Someshwari’s eyes narrowed. Ah, had she thought he wasn’t listening? Vasanti herself had told him she was no longer allowed to try the pillar, that the attempts on the cog room had gotten too many watchmen killed. And now she had another eleven corpses to answer for, going against explicit orders. She was going to get shot for that, as Wen had said.

Unless she had something to show worth that many deaths.

“You really are a nasty little rat, aren’t you?” she said. “Always scurrying around everyone’s business.”

He snorted.

“Come on,” he said. “How many reasons are there for you to get reckless enough for an assault? You think you figured out the tile combination that will open the front gate. You need the brand because you think it’s what will get the device working.”

The tile device in the room just past the one where he had found the brand, the one where the god had almost killed him. Vasanti must have figured them out even though the matching tiles on the iron gates had no symbols on them. The old woman stared at him for a long time.

“I was right,” she suddenly said. “I can’t let you into the Watch. It’s too late for you.”

Tristan blinked, for an instant lost.

“You think you’re the only one Nerei ever trained, boy?” Vasanti harshly said. “You’re the third I’ve met. And both were fucking monsters, just like their maker.”

The Someshwari leaned forward.

“I took it easy on you, tried to nudge you off the trials so you could return to your old life, but always you doubled down,” she said. “The disease is already in the bone.”

He closed his eyes. Anger had not come to him so far, not when he was in the grave and he had yet to buy his way out. Anger, fear, they did not help. But now it came anyway.

“It wasn’t even about me.”

His eyes fleshed.

“Everything,” he said with excruciating calm, “was part of your pissing match with someone not even on this fucking island.”

The old lieutenant sneered.

“You have no idea what-”

They were past that now.

“I don’t care,” Tristan laughed. “And I don’t need to, Vasanti, because you’re going to give me what I want.”

“Should I call the boys back in?” she coldly said.

“It doesn’t matter if you do,” he said. “Because at the end of the day, Vasanti, you’re a coward. You’re afraid of Abuela, afraid of what you’ve done, but most important of all you’re afraid to die – and I’m the only one who can tell you where the thing you need to live is.”

And under the black cloak, under the years and the authority and all the arrogance of someone used to being on the right side of the gun, Tristan knew what he was looking at.

Vasanti was a rat.

“I have people searching,” she said. “Do you think stashing things in a ruined bastion or one of the holes outside will work?”

“I can wait,” Tristan replied. “Longer than you, I reckon.”

Vasanti got up, walked out. Moments later, the two thugs walked in. Tristan closed his eyes and thought of the grave.

—

And hour later Lieutenant Vasanti returned.

She bought her way out of her grave and with that same coin Tristan bought his way out of his. After Vasanti declared him innocent of everything to the Watch garrison, Remund Cerdan’s evil deeds were revealed. He had stolen Tristan’s key and hidden the brand, a location the thief obtained from the infanzon before his death in the maze. He told the lieutenant where the brand was after and she flew into another rage.

After all it was in the Watch’s own armory, just as he’d asked Sergeant Mandisa.

Tristan watched the relief on Lieutenant Vasanti’s face afterwards, how it stayed there, and wondered if she would figure it out before the end. Tomorrow, come morning, Vasanti was going to get those iron gates open and then go through them with every blackcloak still loyal to her. Go plumbing the depths of the pillar for secrets and wonders that would be worth eleven corpses in the eyes of her superiors.

That expedition should serve as a perfectly serviceable distraction for when Tristan pushed her right back into her grave.

# Chapter 35

No one died in the night.

A relief, but it did little to lift the mood when they began gathering in the gate room half an hour before the gate forward opened. Angharad had not slept well, wrestling with what she had heard – trying to sort out the truth from the lies. Song had tried to approach her about it but the Pereduri put her off. Unfair as it was, she resented the Tianxi for forcing her hand about eavesdropping on Isabel and Ferranda. Her world had been simpler before that conversation.

Now Angharad must weigh everything. Was she being unfairly generous, when she thought something good of Isabel Ruesta? Was a contact bending her mind? Or was she being unfair by picking at every thought this way when Ferranda Villazur had brought nothing but accusations. A contract was difficult to prove, but it was just as difficult to disprove. What could Isabel do or say to put Ferranda’s allegations to rest? Nothing. And some of Ferranda’s other accusations had been dubious, the talk of plot and there being a false killer.

Grief at the death of a lover – and to think Sanale had been that, Angharad would never have suspected – could darken one’s mind. Ferranda might have been lashing out.

Or am I looking at Isabel’s chances through the kindest mirror?

The thoughts circled like dogs chasing each other’s tails. There was no clear liar here, no monster whose warped pale face could be revealed by ripping off a mask. Just as she had through the night, Angharad wrestled with her doubts and stared moodily ahead. She did not shun Isabel, but neither did she engage in conversation – she lengthened her stride to stay ahead and prevent it. It left her at Acanthe Phos’ side on the way to the temple-fortress, the blemished traitor needing only a single quelling look to stay silent the whole way.

This time, when they went down the stairs, everyone kept a large distance from each other.

The temple-fortress’ red stone awaited them at the bottom of the cauldron again, wind whistling softly behind them as they passed the bronze gates still open wide. This time, when they passed through the eclectic hall of treasures and trinkets, Angharad hung back. She left the front to others, those yet to become victors. They could deal with the spirit themselves.

“You came back!”

The massive peafowl leapt down from her dais, dead god jostling on her back, and with all the dignity of an excited child trotted towards them. Flicking her tailfeathers happily, she swayed to the sides in celebration.

“I thought you’d died,” the mayura confided. “Mortals are so fragile.”

“Not yet,” Lord Zenzele said, “but then the day’s just begun. Surely one of us will be up for it.”

“Let us be optimists,” Lady Ferranda mused. “I’ll not settle for Xical alone – I choose to believe that, as a community, we can also get Lord Augusto killed.”

The pair, Angharad thought, truly had become thick as thieves. Part of her was glad for them, that their griefs need not be borne alone, but the part of her that must go beyond decency worried. If Lady Ferranda pressed her suspicions and tried to kill Isabel, would Zenzele Duma help her? Angharad did not know and hated that she even had to consider it. This Trial of Ruins, it was like a mire. The longer they stayed in the maze, the deeper they sunk into the mud of their own petty plots and hatreds.

Sometimes she though the spirits might not be the true peril of this maze.

“Watch your tongue,” the Cerdan snarled, “else you-”

Cozme Aflor’s hand on his shoulder silenced him.

“We must win tests to reach the Toll Road,” the older man said. “By the rules our host has laid down, three champions must still be beaten. Is there one among us that would step forward?”

Angharad scoffed, which drew more than a few eyes to her.

“An interesting question to ask,” she said, “when you are not a victor yourself, Cozme Aflor. Where has yesterday’s boldness gone?”

Unfriendly looks, but most of them were not sent her way. To her dismay, she found support in an unexpected place.

“She has a point, Cozme,” Tupoc said, idly tapping his spear against his shoulder. “Go on then, my bold man, take the vanguard. Are you and Augusto not entirely capable of protecting yourselves?”

Angry, worried looks from both men Tupoc had named. Angharad’s eyes narrowed. A split between them and Tupoc, perhaps? It may be that with Cozme at his side, Augusto had decided he need no longer be the Izcalli’s lickspittle. This is Tupoc calling them to heel, then, she thought. Uncertain as to whether she should allow it to happen, Angharad hesitated until the decision was taken out of her hands. Cutting through the rising tension, Song stepped forward and bowed before the mayura.

“Honored elder, I would face one of your champions,” the Tianxi said.

The peafowl peered down at her.

“Do I know you?” the mayura asked. “I feel as if I should be pecking your head.”

“I would prefer you do not, honored elder,” Song politely requested.

It was not possible for a bird to pout, given the lack of lips, but the spirit made a valiant attempt nonetheless.

“Fine,” she sniffed. “Refuse my blessing.”

The mayura waited for a moment, perhaps hopeful calling it a blessing would change Song’s mind, but was destined for disappointment.

“I await the introduction of your champions,” Song said.

The peafowl left in a sulk, returning to the dais to begin her spectacle. Cascades of blue and green silk fell from the ceiling again, the sight less staringly impressive the second time. Curtains surrounded them on all sides as golden light began coursing down. Sounding mor like a Lierganese hawker than an ancient spirit, the mayura began announcing her list of foes again.

“Hark! Will you face Ojas the Clever, who you must defeat in a contest of riddles where every mistake sees you lowered closer to a pool of-”

Angharad only paid half-hearted attention to the list of champions, knowing there was yet time. At least three victories must still be earned to win the right to reach the very summit of the temple and the path to the Toll Road that lay there.

“- Thangaraj, master of mists and illusions, whose defeat must come by might of arms. Then there is-”

“Him, honored elder,” Song said. “Thangaraj. I will face him.”

“Oh, that’s been a while,” the mayura enthused. “Usually they choose Inimai instead, she sounds like a pushover.”

Angharad cocked her head to the side. Was the spirit not the one who had crafted the introductions?

“I was given to understand,” Song said, “that adding restrictions to the test yields greater advances.”

The spirit was visibly pleased at the implication. Also loudly.

“Yesss,” the peafowl hissed. “Tell me.”

“If offer you two oaths,” Song serenely replied. “The first is that I will use only a single shot.”

That was… not unwise, Angharad decided. It was rare to be able to reload one’s gun during a duel, and Song had said nothing of her sword. It was a limitation, but not a crippling one.

“I receive your oath,” the mayura said, then hopped back and forth. “Again.”

“I shall not take more than a step away from where I stand when the test begins.”

The spirit cackled.

“Oh, that is fun,” she said. “I receive your oath.”

A pause.

“Three takes you to the end,” the spirit said. “That means a change in terms.”

“I listen, honored elder.”

“If you lose,” the mayura said, “you’ll become one of my champions.”

A ripple of unease went through the crowd, though this was not news to Angharad. The peafowl had already told her that the last test had this particularity to it.

“That is acceptable to me,” Song replied. “Shall we begin?”

“When you’re ready,” the peafowl happily nodded.

The Tianxi’s silver gaze swept through them.

“I will be leaving, then,” she said. “Kindly do not lower the number of victors in my absence.”

And on that sharp note, Song walked away.

—

Angharad had never seen a test from the outside in this temple, so it was with a curious eye she greeted the changes in the golden light.

What had before been letters and the silhouette of the champions spread out, the strokes thinning as they came to illustrate some kind of strange circular room. As if alive, the strands of gold moved as clouds of mist over a floor that was full of uneven rises and hidden pits. At the heart of it, sitting on a throne, a small bald man with a grand beard and a pot belly was waiting. He had on his lap a mace with a thick head a strange handle – like a saber’s, with a knuckle-bow guard. The Pereduri had never seen such a weapon before, it must be Someshwari.

It would take time before Song reached the grounds of the fight, Angharad knew from experience, so she found a pillar to lean against in a corner and drew back from the crowd. Lord Ishaan seemed as if he might have wanted to chat, but he read her expression and elected to leave her in peace. No, it was another who sought Angharad out.

Lady Isabel Ruesta had dressed with an eye to the practical, even though she was unlikely to be challenging a test today. A high-collared yellow doublet over a pale shirt matched hose of the same shade, tucked into elegant knee-high boots. The sole concession to traditional femininity was the feathered riding hat, angled coquettishly over her black curls. The infanzona was a feast for the eyes, as always, and Angharad would not soon forget how soft her skin had been under her fingers the evening when Isabel had visited her.

Only she was not so certain she should be fond of that memory, now. The kindest possible mirror, Ferranda had called it. What would that mean, if it were true?

Isabel came to stand by her side, hands over her lap. Silence held between them. Would not looking at the infanzona undo the effect of her contract, Angharad wondered? Or did Isabel perhaps need touch to seed the veil over one’s eyes? Angharad could not help but wonder even knowing it was unfair, that Ferranda had accused without proof. But how would one go about proving the unseen? A fair question, but so was the opposite: how would one go about disproving it? It the end it was a matter of trust, and Angharad was feeling thin on trust.

She had uncovered too many lies. It was tiring, to question everything. Enough that she thought it might be better to simply go her own way.

“Hold out your hand,” Isabel suddenly asked.

Angharad stilled. The other woman noticed.

“Ah,” she said. “As I thought. Please allow me, then, a defense against the accusations Ferranda brought to you.”

Would it be unwise, to agree? Her contract at work? Angharad could have let the dog chase each other’s tails for hours and earned nothing but barks, so instead she set aside her own thoughts and doubts. If her mind was uncertain, then she need only avoid relying on her minds. Isabel Ruesta had been accused and was now asking for a way to prove her innocence that would not be harmful to Angharad.

By honor’s count, this should be allowed.

Almost relieved that there was a way around the doubts, the Pereduri offered her hand. Isabel lightly touched it with the tip of her fingers.

“Beginning now,” she said.

Angharad blinked, eyeing the other woman. A lie? She felt nothing at all. Or perhaps Ferranda’s accusations had been most exaggerated. Isabel breathed out.

“The Duchy of Peredur,” Isabel Ruesta said, “is a barren shithole at the edge of the world, full of slack-jawed yokels who fuck seals and claim they were mermaids.”

The Pereduri drew back in complete and utter startlement, though Isabel kept their hands connected. Past the first surprise at the unexpected vulgarity, anger rose. The infanzona had not only insulted her home, she had called her countrymen liars. Even in jest, and surely this must be in jest for Isabel could not possibly believe it – the infanzona withdrew her hand and Angharad paused. Why could Isabel not possibly believe that?

“I would have drawn a blade on most everyone here,” the Pereduri said, “had they said what you just did. Even knowing it was to prove a point.”

“It is best compared,” she said, “to making a plain girl stand in flattering light and clothes. It does not change anything, not truly – a boy who prefers boys will still not take her to bed, nor will one who does not like redheads. But it makes the graceless graceful.”

“And I have been made to see the girl,” Angharad plainly said.

Isabel inclined her head.

“You have. If you were to choose to be angry over this,” she said, “I would not dispute it.”

Angharad’s answering look was cool.

“What other choice is there, Isabel?”

“Allowing me to explain,” she replied.

“Have I stopped you?” Angharad sharply said.

The infanzona worried her lip.

“I do not always control it,” Isabel said. “When my emotions run high, whatever the emotion be – fear, joy, desire, hate, it makes no difference – I draw on the contract. Sometimes I do not even notice it.”

You could be lying, Angharad thought. And she could trust her own mind, not right now, so instead she trusted in honor.

“Had you told me this, there would have been no breach in trust,” she replied. “You did not.”

“I was afraid,” Isabel admitted, “and wronged you because of it.”

The dark-skinned woman breathed in at the stark admission.

“I will not excuse the act,” the dark-haired beauty continued, “but I would tell you what drove me to it, if you will allow.”

Angharad felt little sympathy, and even if she had honor would not have cared for reasons. Still, it was her responsibility to see the entire matter through before making a decision about cutting ties. She nodded permission.

“You must think me some kind of coldblooded seductress,” Isabel ruefully said, “but that is not how it started. My parents, you see, wanted a boy. And when Mother finally gave birth to one, suddenly I was no longer their favorite.”

She breathed out.

“Infanzones are taught as children that prayer answered is a dangerous thing,” Isabel said. “Mine was. I wanted to be the apple of my family’s eye against, instead of that squalling stinking thing, and the Beloved Blossom offered me that.”

“I have never heard of a spirit by that name,” Angharad said.

“There is no reason you should,” the infanzona replied. “She is no Mane, hardly an ancient power. But she was so lovely, so glamorous, and why should I distrust a goddess of love promising me that very thing? Only I was wrong, Angharad.”

Isabel’s smile was a melancholy thing.

“She is, you see, not a goddess of love but of love novels.”

Angharad was Pereduri: she well knew how the difference of a single word could change everything. The infanzona sighed.

“I did not realize what that truly meant until I was older, when the boys that had been my friends began falling in love with me every time I laughed,” Isabel said. “I learned to be wary, to control it, but fear is another emotion – every time I felt dread at the approach of a suitor unwilling to accept a no, the contract bloomed anyway.”

Green eyes lowered to the ground.

“So I embraced it,” she admitted. “Used it to defend myself, set them against each other. Only the Ruesta are not the greatest house of Sacromonte, Angharad. We have superiors, those we must not offend.”

“House Cerdan,” she quietly said.

“They way out was to marry above them, beyond their reach,” Isabel said. “And I found a man who would suit, whose contract even dulled my own, but my reputation followed me. He was courteous but kept his distance. Unwilling to give up, I decided to follow him to this island so that I might convince him.”

“And the brothers?” she asked.

“I needed them to win permission to come from my parents,” the infanzona said. “And, well, I would not push them into danger but should they seek it out themselves I would not weep of the consequences either.”

Angharad had some notion of what it was like, a boy of nobler blood wanting of you something you did not want to give. She had rubbed elbows with izinduna on the dueling circuit, and some of the young men had taken an interest it was not in her to return – and what noble house did not stand higher than the Tredegar, out in Malan? She fought against the sympathy, but it came anyway. Distrusting herself, Angharad reached for honor again.

In her dealings with the Cerdan, it could be said that Isabel Ruesta had kept to the exact lines of honor. Hardly in spirit, but that was not for Angharad to judge. It was between the two of them that trust had been broken.

“Why bring me into it?” she asked.

Isabel hesitated.

“It was duty, in part, to another noble,” she said. “But I will not pretend that I did not notice your eyes on me, or that I misliked the idea of having the protection of your sword arm – or, forgive the crudeness, of a discreet affair with a dashing stranger before stepping into married life.”

Only the man she’d sought must have died when the first wave of trial-takers was slain to the last. Angharad could see how it had all unfolded from there, and found she believed the infanzona. The tale fit the events. She could not take it as truth when she had already been deceived, but neither would she leap to call Isabel a liar. Not that it mattered, for Angharad would follow not her feelings but honor’s lay. And honor tolerated no excuse for what had been done, the secret use of a contract on her. Had it been done by accident, then Isabel would still have been duty-bound to reveal it.

And Angharad was not callow enough to believe it had all been done by accident.

“It is not my place to decide where honor lies between you and others,” she finally said. “Between us, however, offence was given. Out of respect for the aid you have lent me I will not pursue the matter, but any ties between us are sundered.”

Isabel’s face tightened, but she nodded.

“Should I come to lead others again, or enter alliance, I would then be honor bound to tell them what I can of your contract while avoiding your private affairs,” Angharad added.

The infanzona hesitated.

“If you are willing to wait,” she said, “I promise to do this myself come the next sanctuary. I fear for my life should it be said before then.”

The Pereduri cocked her head to the side, considering that. It was not an unwarranted fear. Augusto might well try to blame her for everything.

“Should I suspect you of using your contract on another, I will have to intervene,” she warned.

“That is only fair,” Isabel replied without missing a beat.

Angharad, reluctantly, thought better of her for it. Isabel Ruesta had done wrong, but she was not demanding the right to continue doing it from behind a shield of silence.

“Then I will agree to that,” Angharad said, pushing herself off the pillar. “I believe our conversation, and our ties, have reached a natural end.”

The infanzona looked away, her head lowered enough locks were draped across her face. For a moment Angharad thought she saw cold anger there, but when Isabel turned to her again she found something closer to grief.

“So they have,” Isabel sadly said.

She inclined her head, Angharad jerking a nod back, and stepped away. The Pereduri did not watch her leave, instead looking at the strands of gold still depicting the champion Song was to face. There was no trace of the Tianxi, an irritating thing even though Angharad knew it unreasonable to expect Song to have risen four shrines up in the amount of time it had taken her to speak with Isabel. Sighing, she forced herself to keep looking at the gold so that she would not have to see if others had noticed her conversation with Isabel.

When steps came her way, Angharad decided that she would consider enough of taunt by Tupoc as a breach of truce and comport herself accordingly. Only when the person approaching cleared their throat, it was much too high-pitched. Turning a hard stare on whoever had thought it a sound notion to try her now, Angharad blinked when she saw Isabel standing before her. The infanzona smiled a little shyly, offering her hand to kiss.

“Lady Isabel Ruesta,” she said.

“I-” Angharad began, then frowned in confusion “What is this, Isabel?”

“There is nothing between us now, you said,” the infanzona replied. “An empty slate. I would fill it again, only properly this time.”

“Nothing has changed from moments ago,” she said.

“Everything has changed,” Isabel retorted. “You know of my contract. You know my intentions and what brought me to the Dominion – there is no longer anything hidden between us.”

“I am sure you can find another sword arm,” Angharad sharply replied. “There is no need to inflict this on either of us, Isabel.”

“Angharad,” the green-eyed woman patiently said, “I no longer need a sword arm. I will not take tests. My sole enemy, Augusto, has worn out several shovels digging his own grave. All that lies ahead of me is patiently waiting until others bring the trial to an end so I can stroll up the path to sanctuary and take a ship home.”

That was… well, she could not find a part that was untrue. Not even when looking for a trap.

“I do not need anything from you,” Isabel said. “I seek your company because I desire it.”

“A blank slate is not the promise of forgiveness,” Angharad flatly replied.

“Then I will have to attempt to charm some measure of it out of you,” Isabel said.

The infanzona had to know that the first whiff of the contract being used on her, Angharad would see it as an offence against her. And still she stood here. The Pereduri said nothing, silence setting between then, but still Isabel stood there, offering her up her hand. Undaunted.

“I doubt it,” Angharad said.

She did not kiss the hand. Isabel still smiled before she walked away, joining Lan for a chat. As well she might.

Angharad had replied with three words and not one had been ‘no’.

—

Song’s arrival had the entire room breaking into murmurs.

The Tianxi, Angharad thought, looked sharper when drawn in gold. Her long braid like a single stroke, her chin like a knife. They watched as Song Ren strode into the room where the champion waited, sitting on his throne. She stopped a dozen feet away from the throne, mist swirling around her. Could she see through it as they could, to the treacherous footing and hidden pits beneath? Angharad knew not, and it worried her.

The lips of Song and the champion both moved, but there was no telling what they said. The details were not fine enough for that. Whatever the truth, the champion rose from his throne and idly swung his mace. The Tianxi did not move, bound to the oath of never straying more than a step away from where she stood, save for unsheathing her straight sword.

Then Thangaraj struck, and all breathe in.

He leapt at Song, who swung through his throat, but the man turned into billowing mist. An illusion? Another Thangaraj was back on his throne, laughing, while they could all see another sneaking behind Song while crouching low. The sneak struck at her from behind, but she narrowly parried the blow – her sword gave, though, and the shaft of the mace still hit her leg. That would no doubt bruise.

It was a storm of tricks and taunts after that, Thangaraj dying a dozen times to her blade only to be revealed having a drink or lounging at the foot of his throne or picking up pebbles to throw at her. The one time she came close to cutting him down, when he tried a blow from the side after faking having been an illusion, he abandoned his weapon and threw himself into a pit. Moments later he was back out, weapon in hand.

The champion was toying with her, Angharad thought. Song had yet to suffer more than bruises, but now Thangaraj tried harsher and harsher blows. It was just a matter of time until she took a real wound, and it would be downhill from there. The noblewoman watched with a clenched jaw as Thangaraj mocked her, dancing in close to strike at her with the mace, only Song dropped her sword as she turned.

The mace went right through the back of her neck, turning into mist and the Tianxi snatched at thin air – grabbing the champion by throat and when he opened his mouth Angharad realized why Song had dropped the sword: she’d been drawing her pistol. The shoved it through his mouth, and smiled a cold golden smile before pulling the trigger.

One shot, Angharad thought as Thangaraj’s brains splattered the mist. That was what then other woman had bargained for.

Perhaps she ought not to have worried so much for Song Ren after all, Angharad mused as the others began to cheer.

—

Song’s journey back down was faster than the other way around.

Angharad joined in with the congratulations, which were particularly enthusiastic from Shalini. No one asked the Tianxi how she had seen through the illusion, even though everyone had to suspect it was a contract. The mayura had returned with Song, happy at first but that passed when it was confirmed they now had the right to rise to the summit of the temple-fortress and take the path to the Toll Road. Everyone collected their packs, checked their weapons and then they began moving.

The mayura pattered behind them nervously. Given the spirit’s size and the sharpness of her beak it would have been a worrisome sight, if the great peafowl did not look for all the world like a dog being abandoned.

“You don’t have to leave,” the spirit said. “You can stay the night, you know. It’s safe in here and there used to be a pleasure temple so there’s plenty of beds.”

Lord Ishaan, who she was addressing, slowed his steps and turned to bowed to her as Shalini kept a wary eye on it all.

“I thank you for the offer, guardian, but we intend to reach the end of the maze today,” Lord Ishaan said. “We should not tarry.”

“The road is terrible,” the mayura assured them. “Lots of you might die. You should probably just stay here.”

The Someshwari bowed again, giving no further answer. The peafowl tried again, but always she was politely put off – Cozme said he must bear news back to Sacromonte of a death, Acanthe Phos claimed she could not sleep well in temples and Lady Ferranda replied that should she grow exhausted on the Toll Road she was sure to return. Tupoc boldly counter-offered that the spirit should leave with him as his mount, which to everyone’s alarm the mayura seemed to consider.

“I can’t leave Kshetra’s temple behind,” she told Tupoc. “Sorry. You seem like someone who gets in a lot of trouble, it might have been amusing.”

“If you ever change your mind, find me,” the Izcalli casually replied.

By the time the mayura got to her, Angharad felt like the last in a line of boots about to kick a puppy. It was a senseless thing to feel, of course – spirits were not men, could not be treated the same. The mayura must be centuries old, for all that it seemed to have the mind of a cheerful child. Yet when the peafowl suggested she could stay and rest a bit, perhaps spar with the champion Amrinder, Angharad felt like a heel for refusing.

“I am sorry, honored elder,” she honestly said. “Had we the time to spare I would stay the night, but we yearn for the safety of the sanctuary that awaits us beyond the maze. Many of us have lost loved ones in this maze, it is not the quality of your hospitality that drives us to leave it.”

The mayura’s long neck drooped. She looked glum.

“People never stay unless they’re champions,” she said. “I miss when people came to visit, before we crossed the water.”

“Are your champions not fine company?” she gently asked.

“They forget a lot,” the peafowl muttered. “I’m happy you fought Amrinder like you did, it brought back a lot of him. They were better when Kshetra was around, more alive.”

The bird sighed.

“I like that I can do whatever I want now, but I miss him sometimes,” the mayura admitted. “He was a good god.”

Was it madness, Angharad thought, to see of herself in a spirit? To see a child surviving their kin, alone in a world that seemed so dark and kept closing in from all sides. It must be, and yet here she was. Seeing that very thing.

“I miss my family as well,” she softly said. “I used to be glad to go away from them for months, out on the dueling circuit, but now I would give the world for having spent those days with them instead.”

She sighed.

“But I cannot change that,” Angharad said. “The past is beyond our reach. All we can do is learn from our regrets.”

She reached for her saber, unsheathing the blade as the mayura watched her curiously. She held out her arm, cutting shallowly on her forearm, and wiped the blade before putting it away. With her now-free hand she touched her blood, wetting the tip of her fingers, and smiled at the spirit.

“Lean forward, please,” she asked.

The peafowl did, the desiccated corpse of the god on her back jangling forward. Angharad offered a bow.

“For your fine hospitality I give my thanks, honored elders,” she said, and touched the edge of the golden cradle.

Red stained the metal, though after but a heartbeat the vividness of the color faded.

“It is but a small offering, but I hope you will have joy of it,” Angharad said.

She bowed again, withdrawing a step, and the mayura’s long neck unbent. The spirit studied her, for a long moment, and then decisively nodded.

“You’re nice,” the mayura decided. “I like you.”

“I like you too,” Angharad smiled back.

The peafowl spirit was dangerous, but so were many of Angharad’s companions. The mayura was not ill-natured, not a drop of malice in her, and for that she had meant her words.

“You can have my blessing,” the peafowl allowed, presenting the top her head.

The Pereduri paused, unsure what to do.

“Pet the feathers,” the mayura instructed. “They are very soft.”

Angharad could not contain a grin at how proud she sounded of that. With her clean hand she stroked the feathers, the peafowl make noises of approbation. For a second it sounded as if the mayura was whispering something so Angharad leaned closer, but she must have misheard. It was still only that strange purring sound. After a while she ceased, the mayura withdrawing her head.

“Good luck,” the spirit told her. “I hope you don’t die before you die.”

“Thank you,” Angharad replied, slightly bemused.

Still, she was in a lighter mood as she parted way with the spirit and caught up to the others. One was waiting for her at the back.

“Soft touch,” Song mocked, a smile tugging at her lips.

Angharad stared haughtily down at her.

“Jealousy is unbecoming of you, Song,” she said. “It is not my fault you spurned her blessing when offered.”

“You see right through me,” the other woman drily replied, hand over heart.

They were both grinning by the time they caught up to the rest.

—

They went all the way up, feet swallowing the stairs, until they emerged at the heart of the small tower overlooking precipitous heights.

From there a small wooden bridge filled the gap, taking them to the edge of the great cliffs surrounding the fortress-temple. Forward they went again, eager to find what lay ahead, and as the side of the cliff turned into a massive set of stairs they looked upon the promised Toll Road.

It looked, Angharad thought, simple enough. At the bottom of the stairs waited a long stone bridge over a rapid river, across which they all saw a riot of lights. Lanterns by the hundreds hanging on what she was moved to see was the end of the cavern, a natural wall. And set into that wall, surrounded by a halo of lanterns, waited a great gate of bronze.

“Are we clear to cross?” Shalini Goel asked, sounding surprised. “I see no shrine left.”

“Look closer at the bridge,” Lady Ferranda replied.

It was only then Angharad noticed them. Markers like those used for miles back in Malan, raised stones. Set in the middle of bridge at precisely equal distance, ten in whole. Someone cursed.

“Is every stone a test?” Lord Zenzele asked.

The fair-haired infanzona nodded. The mood took a turn, as was only to be expected. To triumph over ten gods was no small order, even for a group such as theirs.

“That is not the worst part,” Ferranda added. “Every time a test is failed, that tenth of the bridge collapses into the river. I hear making a leap across one section is feasible, but two?”

She grimaced.

“Best not lose twice in a row, else we’ll risk swimming.”

# Chapter 36

They broke for an early lunch near the bottom of the stairs.

It felt morbid to Angharad, having a meal looking down at what might become a grave for some of those eating, but she supposed it would have been even worse to stop halfway through the Toll Road and dine overthe grave. They split into small groups for their meals of hard bread, cold pork and whatever tepid water they had left in their skins. Talk was quiet, as if the spirits below might be roused by too loud a conversation, and to the noblewoman it all felt like the breath before the storm.

Only a different storm came calling.

That Song would sit by her side for the meal was half-expected by now – but only half, it would have been arrogance to go further than that – but it had not been Isabel’s habit to do so unless the meal was communal. When the infanzona elegantly sat herself a step lower than them, it came as a surprise. Angharad made herself refrain from noticing how Isabel had unbuttoned her doublet and so her respective heights allowed her a … plunging view.

Twice Song looked at Angharad. For a fever dream moment she thought that the other woman was trying to catch her looking, but the mounting incredulousness on the Tianxi’s face finally told her otherwise. Isabel’s idle talk about Izcalli fashions was interrupted by Song’s sharp voice.

“Ruesta, it would be best for you to eat elsewhere.”

“Are you so ardently in favor of asymmetrical skirts?” Isabel replied, cocking an eyebrow. “I had thought better of you.”

Song looked Angharad’s way, as if prompting her to speak, and something of the gesture irked her. She was not a trained parrot, to speak when spurred so that courtiers could laugh. And she had told Isabel, for better or worse, that their slate was clean.

“It is only a meal, Song,” Angharad said.

“It is a mistake,” Song flatly replied. “One you ought to know better than to commit.”

And there the Pereduri was able to muster some steel at last. It was the most foundational of rights of a noble to decide who was allowed to sit at their table. Song was Republican, would not know better, but an unintentional insult was still that.

“I can decide,” Angharad evenly said, “who I eat with.”

And without a vote first, she almost added, but bit down on it. It was unworthy of her and the forbearance that Song had shown her on this isle. The Tianxi’s eyes narrowed nonetheless. Isabel, ever the peacemaker, attempted to cool the flames.

“I know we have not been on the best of terms, Song,” she said. “But I would make amends. I-”

“You are,” the Tianxi rudely interrupted, “every bedside story for Tianxi children made flesh. A useless, grasping thing that draws breath only by taking from those with skill, will or decency. Yiwu in the truest, most fundamental sense of the word.”

“That,” Angharad said, “was uncalled for.”

Song turned her silver gaze on her and what the noblewoman saw there gave her pause. She had never seen the Tianxi disappointedbefore, and it felt like a knife in the belly. Guilt was swift. Rudeness was not to be tolerated, but it was true that this was not Llanw Hall’s table. Had she not been forcing a guest on Song, herself breaching manners?

“I can also choose who I eat with, Angharad,” Song said, popping the last of her bread in her mouth.

She swallowed, then rose to her feet.

“And did.”

Song took up her pack and walked away. Angharad froze, her first instinct to follow but her mind arguing otherwise. Isabel’s eyes found hers and for a searing moment she wondered if this had all been some scheme. If the infanzona’s contract had moved them both somehow, made them-

“You should go,” the infanzona advised. “I did not mean to come between you two, Angharad.”

She then faintly grimaced, looking discreetly around them.

“And people are already noticing,” Isabel said. “It needs to be passed off as trivial.”

It had not even occurred to Angharad that eyes would be on them, but now that it did she felt a flush of humiliation. It felt not unlike being slapped in public, though it might well be her own palm responsible for the sting on her cheek. She nodded, rising to her feet. Song had hardly gone far, only a few steps away as she checked her munitions and belted her sword properly. The Tianxi did not acknowledge her standing there, so Angharad waited awkwardly for a time before finally clearing her throat.

“You should finish your meal,” Song said. “There will not be another opportunity for hours.”

Angharad could not apologize, for she had not done anything wrong. It would have been slighting her own honor to make apologies for nothing.

“I did not properly grasp,” she finally said, “the depths of your dislike for Lady Isabel. That is my failing.”

Father had taught her that. If you cannot apologize, instead acknowledge a mistake of your making. It will carry much the same meaning and represent a concession besides. She could almost hear his voice, the sound of their boots on the gravel as they strolled around the gardens, and Angharad ached with the loss of it. She would never hear his voice again. Any of their voices.

“My dislike,” Song bit out. “Circle and Gods.”

The Tianxi glared up, but she pitched her voice low.

“You heard the same thing I did, Angharad,” Song said. “How her contract works. Why would ever allow her in your presence again, to dig her hooks into your mind?”

“She has admitted her wrongdoings and apologized,” Angharad replied. “I cut ties over it, calling our score even.”

“So now she’s making a new score,” Song sighed. “Since you have a blank slate.”

The noblewoman shuffled uncomfortably.

“How do you know she is not using her contract on you?” Song asked.

“I do not,” Angharad said. “But the same is true of everyone I have had dealings with. She has demonstrated her contract to me, and though I cannot swear I would be able to tell were it used on me it can only achieve so much.”

“The filter is not the most dangerous part,” Song said.

She paused at Angharad’s open confusion.

“That is what her contract is,” Song said. “A perception filter that lets you see the good and dims the bad.”

The Pereduri frowned.

“And how would you know that?”

The slightest pause.

“Because I’ve almost entirely deciphered her contract,” Song Ren evenly replied.

For a moment Angharad thought she had misheard, for what she had just been told was absurd. Decipher another’s contract? Only a god and their contractor could ever know such terms, and it was not as if the pact was some scroll in a library that… Yet Song’s face remained deadly serious, and so Angharad swallowed. She could either call the Tianxi a liar or take her at her word, and Song had never once lied to her.

“They would kill you for that,” she hoarsely said.

She did not put a name to ‘they’, for there were too many to count.

“It is not as rare or potent an ability as you think,” Song told her. “There was a contractor at the Old Fort who could do something similar – though by sniffing out the gods.”

“The High Queen’s court employs such bloodhounds by the dozen,” Angharad dismissed. “But you speak of deciphering terms, Song.”

Of being able to read some of the most precious, dangerous secrets in all of Vesper simply by being in the same room.

“And I told you that my pact is not as potent as you think,” Song replied. “Deciphering is not an exaggeration – why do you think I learned so many languages?”

Oh, Angharad thought, and then suddenly it occurred to her that Song might be able to see her own contract. No, she told me she cannot read Gwynt, the Pereduri remembered. And surely her contract with the Fisher must be written in the old tongue? She swallowed, knowing that she would only get an answer if she asked.

“Can you- did you…”

“I have the loosest sense of what your contract can achieve,” Song said. “But it is very difficult to look at, as if I were reading with my eyes open underwater.”

A heartbeat of hesitation.

“I have been advised not to look too closely,” the Tianxi admitted. “That your gods is… temperamental.”

The Fisher was not, at least in the way the other woman must have meant it. The Fisher was not a thing given to fits of rage, to passing tantrums. The rage in him was old and deep, carved into the bone and unchanging.

“I have known kinder storms,” Angharad quietly said, for she would not say more.

She sighed, resisting the urge to fiddle with her braids. Mother had always slapped her hands when she did, called it an unfortunate habit.

“I would ask that you keep your knowledge of my contract secret,” she stiffly asked.

It was walking very close to the lines of honor to request such a thing, but it must be done if she was to ever return to the Kingdom of Malan.

“I am not a gossip,” Song said. “Principles aside, to run my mouth in such a way would likely get me killed. Though as I will not speak of your pact, I would ask you extend me the same courtesy.”

Angharad shallowly nodded, suspecting she had not quite hid her relief from the silver gaze.

“Given what I have told you,” Song continued, “I would repeat what I said earlier: the most dangerous part of Ruesta’s contract is not the filter. That is the habit it induces.”

She paused, looking for words.

“Once you grow used to seeing the good in someone, your mind follows down that road habitually,” the Tianxi said. “She does need to use her contract constantly, because she has taught everyone around her to assume the best of her actions. Her blank slate is favorable.”

Angharad frowned.

“What you describe,” she said, “sounds not unlike trust.”

Keeping faith and doing good deeds resulting in a worthy reputation was not sinister, it was the very nature of civilization. Song looked irritated.

“Not earned trust,” she said. “Fostered.”

Then it was simply giving the benefit of the doubt which Angharad saw nothing all that sinister in either, but she could see saying as much would only further trouble Song. That a contract had been involved complicated things, but to use one’s reputation was not an evil act. The act of using the contract on another without their knowledge was where the breach of honor lay, and that part Isabel had addressed.

“I hear your concerns,” Angharad said. “And I would not be comfortable serving as shield to one intending to use their contract on others.”

“But,” Song said.

“She has sworn not do so, save by accident,” the Pereduri said. “And then to reveal her contract publicly once sanctuary is reached.”

Song looked at her for a very long time, silver eyes hooded. What went on behind them she could only guess at, for the other woman’s face was calm as a pond on a windless day.

“If you hear my concerns, then act on them,” Song finally said. “Do not speak to Isabel Ruesta alone.”

It chafed, for someone to try to dictate to her like this, but Angharad swallowed her dislike. It was a request not made high-handed but out of concern for her safety. She could bend her neck that much, so the dark-skinned noble nodded in concession.

“And once we reach the next sanctuary, please cut ties properly,” Song said. “She will have no need of your protection, having that of the blackcloaks, and should face the consequences of her actions without an intercessor.”

Angharad grimaced. A steeper term but not, she thought, one unreasonable to ask. I have no intention of staying long in sanctuary anyhow, she reminded herself. And tempting as the thought was to let Isabel make a private apology now that she knew the contract had little to do with her attraction – a filter could not make something out of nothing – she could not in good conscience linger at sanctuary for that purpose alone. It would be highly frivolous.

“We will part ways at the sanctuary,” she conceded. “And I had no intention of intervening when she is to recover her honor, but should you want me to take an oath I-”

“No need for that,” Song said, shaking her head. “Your word is enough.”

How easily that answer came was almost enough to make Angharad feel guilty for what she had done. Namely, cutting out the mention of time from the promise. It was cracking a door slightly open, nothing more. So she told herself. There was still some stiffness between them after that, not every wrinkle smoothed, but Song stood by her side when everyone gathered to take the last steps down together. It would be different now, Angharad thought.

Thing always were when you realized you could lose something you had taken for granted.

—

The stone marker stood tall as a man and about as broad.

It was bare of carvings and adornment, nothing more than a roughly hewn slab of granite standing sentinel as the entrance of the bridge. Angharad could hear the roiling current of the river below, see white foam and sharp rocks bathed in golden light from above. Ferranda had told them that to fail a test was for a tenth of the bridge to fall below and Angharad saw only death in those waters. If we lose twice in a row, we are finished. It would be too broad a gap to cross, even with ropes.

As the survivors – all fourteen of them – stood before the marker, there was a heartbeat of hesitation. Who was to be the first of those not yet crowned victors? Song had removed herself from that list, and quite boldly, so the eyes went to those that remained: Lan, Brun, Yaretzi, Cozme Aflor and Lady Ferranda. Angharad hid her surprise at who took the initiative.

“I shall take the vanguard, then,” Cozme Aflor said, rolling his shoulders. “Wish me luck.”

Courage, Angharad thought, from one she had not expected to have such a virtue. Yet he must be a coward at heart, for why else would he have returned to Augusto Cerdan’s side? If the mangled infanzon was worried at the notion of losing his protector, it did not show. Augusto’s face was a study of nonchalance.

“Try not to die,” Tupoc casually replied. “It would be inconvenient to have to pull out all the stops as early as the second test.”

“You’re all heart, Xical,” the man snorted, stroking his moustache.

He stepped forward onto the bridge, and the air shivered. They could see all that followed clearly, for though all had put away their lanterns – the few real ones, but also the iron things the Watch had gifted them – the golden light of the machine above made it look like a strange summer day.

The stone cracked, a creature ripping itself free of the cracks. It was a centipede, a filthy horror all crawling legs and large as a man’s torso. The legs got larger as they went up and ended in a head of twisted curved mandibles – it looked like a skull atop a ribcage, though all of it carapaced sordidness.

Cozme, to his honor, did not flinch.

“God of the land, I greet you,” the older man said.

“Pick a weapon,” the spirit said, its voice like plunging your hand in a pit of maggots. “Wield and face it: slay my puppet to win passage.”

The older man remained silent for a time, then sighed.

“Knife,” he said.

Not a respectable weapon, but then Cozme had proved to be anything but.

“Agreed,” the spirit laughed.

Cozme Aflor loosened his sword belt, dropping it on the stone floor, then his pistol and powder followed. It was the long knife strapped to his side he drew, the shine of fine Someshwari steel catching the golden light from above. Yet Angharad’s eye was on the spirit instead, who was shaking and twisting as it vomited a river of filth. Bile and mucus full of squirming, foul things shaped themselves into a man inch by inch. Cozme’s height and build were matched, the spirit at last spewing out something like chitin that the puppet took in hand. Threading fingers through the filth, the silhouette shaped the material into a mirror of Cozme’s own knife as if it were clay to be molded.

The older man spat to the side.

“I’ve seen worse in the Murk,” Cozme said. “Try harder.”

“Begin,” the spirit hissed.

Both struck.

Before the second pass had ended, Angharad knew why Cozme had chosen the knife. She had seen him shoot a pistol and in passing use a sword, but he was nowhere as deft a hand with them as he was the sharp length in his hand. It was a brutal bout, more like the tangle of back-alley cats than an honor duel: Cozme struck with his fists as well as his knife, gouged eyes and on the third pass ended up rolling on the floor with the horror trying to choke it out. Even as cuts opened the skin of both, bile and blood spilling in a foul puddle, the mustachioed soldier did not flinch even when the puppet’s features turned into a nest of screeching centipedes.

He cut and gouged and choked, until they were on their feet again and swinging.

The cut that ended the fight was the costliest. Cozme slid under the monster’s guard, striking its chin with his palm and rocking it back as it swung past him – then he closed in, ramming his knife into the puppet’s throat and ripping it open, but the creature pressed against him and stabbed into his back. It struck again and again, wailing away the flesh until Cozme’s knife was all the way through its throat and the head came tumbling down.

It collapsed back into the vileness the spirit had spewed out, drenching the soldier who roared out a curse, but the puppet was done. Cozme ripped out the chitin knife yet stuck in him and threw it over the edge of the bridge.

“Told you,” he panted out.

“Shame how bile got in the wounds,” Tupoc idly noted. “If Tredegar had not gotten our friend Tristan killed, he might have seen to that.”

Angharad ignored the insult and the bickering that followed it, eyes staying on Cozme. He had been stabbed five times, but with his coat she could not tell how deep it had gone. He still seemed able to move his arm, at least. Yet blood loss alone would ensure he was far from at his best. That was a loss, for the purpose of crossing the bridge.

It was a gain for when the time would come for Augusto Cerdan’s end to find him.

The spirit whose blunt test they had beaten did not deign to humor them with a confirmation, instead slithering back into the crack it had emerged from. Yet the bridge did not collapse when they gingerly began to walk, as plain a crowning as they would get. Cozme hung back, Augusto helping him dress his wounds, and Angharad avoided both. In time she would face them both, but until then it was beneath her to loom like some sort of scavenger and pick at the their wounds. She joined the gathering before the second stone marker instead.

“I will take the second,” Brun told everyone.

Some murmurs of approval.

“Good luck,” Lan sweetly said, smiling very wide.

It was heartening, Angharad thought, to see some fine comradery between Sacromontans after all the backbiting of their infanzones. The pair must have been friends.

This time the spirit was not so unpleasant to behold: when the stone cracked, what emerged was almost human. It looked like a smooth, genderless child whose face was wrinkled with old age. It spoke in a voice sweet as the flowing of water, offering its test.

“I will run around my part of the bridge, screaming,” the spirit said. “You must touch me with a hand to win. You have nine hundred breaths to do so.”

Brun carefully ensured that the spirit would be tangible, then haggled the terms. The strange spirit refused to remove the time limit but conceded that in exchange it would not seize Brun’s soul should he lose, only if he died during the test. It seemed well-bargained to Angharad, but of course it was not so simple as that: within a heartbeat of the test beginning, the spirit turned invisible. It took Brun by surprise, the fair-haired man having clapped his hands over his ears – perhaps in a anticipation of the spirit’s screaming being harmful.

It had been her guess as well.

Angharad was not the one taking the test, so it might be different for her, but as far as she could tell the only harmful thing about the screams was that they were so exaggerated it sounded like the spirit was making sport of them

Still, though the creature was invisible it made noise and the touch of its feet on the floor could barely be made out. Brun had his contract as well, though by the way the Sacromontan began blindly reaching into thin air Angharad suspected his power could not detect the spirit at all. Yet for all the difficulties the man was clever and quick – only he seemed inexplicably clumsy today, as if his limbs had slowed. It was a small thing, but always he seemed to miss the screaming and giggling spirit by inches. Was the creature using some sort of power to slow him?

It was near the end of the time that the test turned dangerous. The spirit began to hide near the edge of the bridge, and it baited Brun near the edge again and again – twice it tried to kick him down into the waters, the second time almost succeeding.

By the time the nine hundredth breath had passed, the spirit had not been caught.

“Missed me,” it laughed, coming back into sight for a moment long enough to grin.

A tenth of the bridge collapsed under it, falling chunk by chunk. Angharad ran to the edge even as Brun did the same, the fair-haired man leaping as his footing disappeared under him – she caught his arm, grunting as she dragged him forward. His knees still hit the edge of the bridge, no doubt bruising them, but Angharad got him back on the bridge. They both collapsed on the floor and Brun rolled away, revealing a face that still seemed calm even having come so very close to dying.

It was, she thought, impressive nerve on the man’s part.

“Congratulations, rat,” Augusto Cerdan drawled. “You are our first failure of the day.”

Angharad turned a cool gaze on him.

“Worry not, Lord Augusto,” she said. “You will always be such in my eyes, no matter the date.”

“Ha!” Zenzele chortled, and he was not alone.

Augusto was not beloved. Eyes turned to the newly formed gap, after that, and though some – Tupoc and Lan – suggested the leap could be made without help others prevailed on a hook and rope being used. It took a quarter hour to fix two hooks against the stone on the other side of the bridge, but after that the crossing on two parallel ropes was not all that difficult. The cautious crossed on all fours, the rest trusted their footing.

All were aware that a second defeat in a row might well kill them all, so there was no talk of anyone taking up the test before its nature was revealed.

The stone cracked and two wriggling shapes shot out, unfolding like paper cranes. Angharad winced at the sight of them, for the pair of spirits she beheld wore the shape of the dead. With bulging eyes, skin gone grey and their too-long ghastly tongues hanging loose the spirits looked like hanging victims. Both held onto the stone marker with sharp fingernails, swaying as they considered their supplicants.

“Play with us,” the spirit to the left said.

It choked on its tongue as it spoke, and the sound would have been comical if not for the ugly rasp to the words. Like rope coiling tight, like gulping at air that would not come.

“Two come to play,” the spirit to the right said. “Xiao Xiantiao. A strike to the face for every missed clap, and no one can step in.”

Unease spread like malignant air as Angharad shot a glance at Song, hoping for a translation. The Tianxi frowned.

“It means ‘little lines’,” she said. “But I do not know the meaning.”

“It’s a children’s clapping game in the Republics.”

Gazes swiveled to the speaker: Yaretzi, who looked uncomfortable at the weight of the attention she was receiving. She toyed with one of her turquoise earrings.

“I am surprised you never heard of the game,” Yaretzi continued, cocking an eyebrow at Song. “I was taught of it because how staggeringly common it is over all of Tianxia.”

“I had a strict upbringing,” Song admitted.

That felt like a very long story forced into a very short sentence, Angharad thought. Eyes moved to Lan, who laughed.

“Hey, don’t you fine folk glare at me,” the blue-lipped woman said. “I’ve got the Tianxi look, but I was born in Sacromonte. We played slap-a-liar like all the other kids.”

What a horrifying name. Yaretzi cleared her throat.

“I believe the game is also called the ‘lamp song’ around the Trebian Sea,” she said. “The words are different in Antigua, but not the rhythm and movements.”

That found purchase.

“I know that one,” Acanthe Phos called out. “Used to play it with my brothers.”

“It will have to be the two of us, then,” Yaretzi said. “Unless we are to teach the game to others?”

“I am not sure that would be wise,” Song said. “Clapping games are rote repetition, no?”

Meaning even someone with finer reflexes might not do as well as someone who simply knew the order of movements down to not needing thought.

“I take it the game is more complex than simply clapping left and right?” Angharad asked.

“There’s two sequences with up, down and a finger snap,” Yaretzi replied. “Then for the second part you do them the opposite way.”

“It sounds risky for someone new to learn them, then,” Angharad opined.

There was some argument – Lord Zenzele suggested that Shalini and her unnaturally quick hands might be a sure bet, until she asserted that her contract might instead make her the single less suited person present – but eventually it was agreed that Yaretzi and Lady Acanthe would be their champions. After that it was only a matter of being cautious. They asked that the spirits demonstrate the game with each other, to make sure it was the same they knew, and then settled the stakes.

So long as one finished the game and forfeit without dying, the spirits agreed, the test would be considered as passed. Only in exchange for that they demanded should either Yaretzi or Acanthe miss five claps in a row, their lantern would be forfeit. Understandably, neither was pleased by this.

“It is the best deal we are likely to get,” Lady Ferranda said.

“Easy to say, when your soul is not on the line,” Acanthe bit back.

“You would do well,” Zenzele Duma mildly said, “not to confuse patience with forgiveness, Lady Acanthe. You will have none of that from me after the Trial of Lines – or from most standing here, I think.”

The acne-scarred lady glared at them all, then grit her teeth.

“Fine,” she said. “I’ll do it. But I am already a victor and now risking myself a second time – in exchange, I must not be called upon for another test until we reach the end of the maze.”

Some tried to argue against, but it was half-hearted work. Angharad though it a reasonable demand and so she bent her neck along the others. The pair stepped forward to face the spirits, who crawled all the way out of their marker to sit down on the ground. Their loose, wide-sleeved grey coats pooled on the floor as they tucked in their long-nailed teeth underneath the fold of blue robes ending at their ankles. Settling face-to-face, the pairs stilled and  began to play.

The trick used by the spirits should have been obvious, but Angharad had not thought of it: though their hands moved unerringly both began singing a different song.

Neither was the right song.

Acanthe, taken aback, missed two claps in a row before catching up. It was Yaretzi that helped her, loudly singing the true tune as she kept going. The diplomat, Angharad was impressed to see, had not missed a beat. After that the spirits began to pull every trick they could. They slowed or quickened their hands, presented the grim sight of their heads turning all the way around, threw mockery and insults. Twice more Acanthe missed claps, and Yaretzi finally missed as well.

The rest of them hung on to every gesture, knowing there was nothing at all they could do. The most prudent among them retreated close to the gap, perhaps intending on attempting a leap back if the test was failed. Angharad doubted it would amount to anything. Besides, for all that now and then a beat was missed neither seemed anywhere near the five in a row that would lose their soul. They need only until-

The first sign something went wrong was when Acanthe winced after a particularly hard clap. The spirit facing her leaned in, leering, and struck even harder – it got a yelp of pain out of the noble girl. Angharad could only gawk at the sight. It had been a hard clap, but surely not enough to hurt Acanthe. Had her hand already been wounded? Only it was both hands that had her moaning as the spirit began putting its back into the slaps, until with a sickening sound Acanthe Phos’ left wrist snapped.

Cleanly broken. Her contract’s price, Angharad thought. Has to be. No one alive had bones so weak.

“Keep going,” Yaretzi hissed. “They only need five to-”

One clap missed, two, three, four – and Acanthe dragged up her broken hand, screaming as the clap rippled down her arm. She barely managed another clap after that, weeping and gibbering, and missed three more after. Again her bad hand went up, a scream ripping itself clear of her throat as the spirit slammed its palm against hers, but while she began missing claps again Yaretzi finished a discordantly cheerful rhyme in Cathayan and the game ended. Angharad breathed out.

Never five in a row. Acanthe Phos would keep her soul.

“Good, good,” the spirit to the left said. “Lovely game. The forfeits now, yes?”

The one to the right struck without warning, its knuckle catching Acanthe in the chin. She fell back, screaming more in surprise than pain. Yaretzi took her own blow more carefully, rolling with it. The difference in training showed. Acanthe was struck again while on the ground, right in the eye – it was certain to blacken – and then Yaretzi got her turn again. It was, however, the last blow the Izcalli diplomat would get. She had only missed two claps.

Acanthe Phos had missed many more than that.

It would have been too much of a compliment to call what followed an execution. It was a murder, nothing more than that, brutal and drawn out and gleefully done. They all watched in anguished silence as the spirits toyed with their victim, changing who held her down and who struck. After five blows, Acanthe’s face was a bloody mess.

By the eight it was beyond bruised flesh, her nose broken and cartilage peeking out.

On the ninth her cheekbone broke.

On the tenth she lost her eye and began choking on her own blood.

The spirits waited after that, Acanthe’s head in one’s lap as she gurgled and died.

“Finish your last blow, you foul things,” Angharad snarled. “Eleven is all you won.”

Laughter.

“We never said how long between blows,” a spirit said. “Wait and see.”

It wasn’t the blood that killed Acanthe, at least not the  bloodshe was choking on. She began convulsing, something in her skull broken from a blow, and died with a plaintive wheeze. And as the last breath left her, the spirit to the right gently flicked her cheek with a sharp nail.

“Eleven,” it said. “One survived. You may pass, now.”

They went back into their stone, bellies full, and silence reigned in their wake.

Angharad closed Acanthe’s eyes and Song helped her throw the body into the river after so that carrion would not pick at it.

It was little, but all they had to give.

—

The spirit that awaited beyond was a fox in silver, its brisk manners welcome after the sordidness of the last test.

“Thrice will I release birds,” the fox said. “Only one will be true, and this one you must slay before it flees beyond your reach.”

A hunter’s challenge and hunter stepped forward to meet it: Lady Ferranda Villazur, her musket already in hand, claimed the test. She haggled only a little with the fox spirit, which had Angharad frowning. Better terms might have been had with a little effort, as they stood they were quite vague and – ah, she finally thought. Song had idly come to stand a few feet behind Ferranda, and the ploy was made clear. The spirit released five gulls from its back, the lovely things images in perfect silver taking flight.

“Second from the left,” Song stated.

A flint struck, powder burned, the gull dropped and already Ferranda was reloading her musket.

“That is not the spirit of the test,” the fox insisted.

“It is not against its rules, god of the land,” Ferranda flatly replied. “Again.”

Irked, the spirit no longer showed restraint. It was a dozen small birds that erupted from its back in a flock, silver sparrows, but again Song called the shot and Ferranda took it. The spirit only grew angrier, the last time unleashing a veritable swarm of birds of all shapes and sizes. That proved to be a mistake, for the differences made the target even easier to call.

“Cormorant, middle left,” Song said.

The fox was gone before the dead bird even hit the ground, angrily burrowing back into its stone. How thoroughly the test had been beaten brought back some boldness to their lot, straightening backs, but Angharad thought it would take more than a single victory to erase the shadow left by Acanthe’s brutal death.

“Eleven victors, now,” Tupoc noted. “Almost halfway through and we can still afford a corpse.”

Unpleasant as his words were, they were true enough no one took him to task over them.

The fifth of the ten markers was inhabited by the most unsettling spirit yet. It was a two-headed snake, its scales a vivid green and red, but it was not the reptile that spoke to them: when those fanged maws opened, they revealed the small heads of infants inside.

“A simple game,” the serpent said.

It slithered along the ground, oil trailing in its wake and slowly coming to trace a perfect grid of ten by ten, covering all of its section of the bridge save for a few feet across.

“Two play,” the serpent spirit said. “You can cross when there are no eyes on you, but when there are you cannot. If you are caught moving, you are thrown back ten feet. You have seven hundred breaths to cross.”

Ishaan immediately hemmed in on the loophole she had.

“And will you stand at the same place the entire time?” he asked.

“I will not move,” the serpent conceded.

Not impossible, then, though no doubt there would be some sort of trick to it.

“Seems like my kind of game,” Lan easily said, stepping forward.

“One,” the serpent said.

“Come now, not so fast,” the blue-lipped woman said. “The last time a test had a set amount of time, the god did not get a soul out of a loss – only a death. It seems only fair for the same terms to apply again.”

“Insolent rat,” the serpent spirit scathingly replied.

“You have me dead to rights,” Lan grinned. “And I’m no great athlete either, easy to catch. I’d be splendid fodder, if you bothered to lure me in properly.”

The infant’s mouth inside the maw pulled into a pout, which had Angharad shivering in disgust. It was tempted, though, and conceded in exchange for the concession that standing on a line would also be enough to get you thrown back ten feet. The terms were agreed to by the second who would take the test: Augusto Cerdan. It was with narrowed eyes that Angharad watched him step forward. What did the infanzon gain by this? He was already a victor and taking risks would win him no friends.

Or was he a victor? Augusto might be nobly born, but he had no honor. He might well have lied about a victory to save his life. Yet he would have needed to fool not only her but also Tupoc who – who was frowning at the infanzon, looking surprised for once. It does not matter anyway, Angharad reminded herself. We are under truce until the tests are done.

“Prepare yourself,” the serpent spirit said. “We begin.”

The two positioned themselves at the edge of a line, preparing to move. The snake turned its head and they shot forward, only gaining half a foot before it turned back. Neither were standing on a line.

“Tricky, tricky,” the spirit complained. “Again.”

It turned and again the pair moved, only a heartbeat later both went flying – thrown back by an invisible force.

“Hey,” Lan complained, dusting herself off as she rose. “Your eyes weren’t on us.”

“Did I say anything about my eyes?” the serpent spirit smiled with a toddlers’ mouth.

It was then Angharad realized that the other she could no longer see the other head.

“Shit,” Song quietly said. “They’re two spirits, not one.”

The Tianxi was right: the second head had split into another snake entirely, now standing on another side of the grid. It grinned at them all as Angharad went back over the wording of the terms in her mind. The spirit was right, it had never specified only its eyes would count and promised only it would not move from its position. As was often the way with spirits, though, they did not make the bargain impossible to fulfill. The snakes left slight openings for the pair to advance, slight but enough that the pair could gain an inch or two at a time.

Only they needed to maneuver precisely every time and ten successes were tenfold undone by a single mistake.

Whichever spirit caught them threw them back in the direction opposite them with that invisible force, and as the pair were toyed with by the creatures Angharad began to glimpse the enemy’s plan. Lan and Augusto were caught more often by the snake on the side, slowly moved to the left edge of the grid.

The same that ended mere feet away from a bridge with no railing.

“One must love the Trebian Sea,” Lord Zenzele snorted. “The only place in all the world where it is the fish that fish you.”

Angharad might have felt a sliver of amusement, if it were only Augusto’s life on the line. Lan, though, did not deserve such an end. The pair realized their trouble soon enough, taking greater care with the spirit on the side, but there was only so much they could do.

“Caught you,” the spirit crooned, and Angharad saw their newest trick.

It was only the snake on the side that would catch the pair stepping on a line, forcing them to the side. And Lan was shoved roughly ten feet nearer to the edge, half fingers’ width away from the furthest line of the grid. One more mistake and she’d be over the edge.

She went very, very still.

“You bitch,” Augusto snarled. “You can’t wait the test out, we’ll both-”

He went flying as well, landing on his knees but a foot behind Lan. He swallowed his words, face gone pale. Neither moved, but knowing they were a single mistake away from death. Only neither of their poses were all that comfortable – Augusto was sitting on the back of his own foot – and the gazes of the serpents stayed on them unblinking. They could breathe, if shallowly, but not even swallow. The gazes went away and Lan swallowed, but Augusto was bolder – he unfolded his leg, which he had been sitting on.

The spirit on the side turned its gaze back on him before he could finish, leaving him stuck halfway. He froze, did not move an inch, but his leg began to tremble. The pose was too hard to maintain. The trembling a little, at first, but it got worse. He was shaking. With a scream of terror, Augusto Cerdan toppled to the side and the spirit screeched in glee through a toddler’s lips.

A heartbeat later he was over the edge.

Angharad, rope in hand, stepped forward. In the water she could see the infanzon, how he had landed on one of the rocks in the rapids – he screamed like a seagull, impaled through the side and only that slow death keeping the current from sweeping him away to a faster one.

“Cozme,” Augusto screamed. “Cozme, help.”

The mustachioed man looked over the edge, stood there for a long time, then shook his head.

“You won’t survive that,” he replied. “Best go with the current, Augusto. It will be faster.”

“You fucking cock,” the infanzon shouted. “Your traitor. Isabel, ISABEL – throw me a rope, I order you.”

Isabel Ruesta walked away, out of his sight. She looked distressed.

“Tredegar,” Augusto tried, growing panicked. “You can’t leave me to die, there’s no honor in this, there is-”

Angharad met his eyes, for a long moment, and thought of that night in the woods when he had fired the pistol. Tried to kill half of them so he might live a little longer.

She looked away.

By the time the span of the test ended, the screams had turned to sobs. When the portion of the bridge began to collapse Angharad threw Lan the rope and dragged her up with Ferranda’s help. The stone falling in the river drowned out even Augusto’s sobs, and then there was nothing heard from him at all. Buried in stone and water, not even his corpse was there to be seen.

They set up the ropes and crossed again.

—

The sixth marker cracked open to reveal what Angharad thought to be a headless dog, until it rose on its back feet and revealed its stomach was a froglike face.

“I will release a fly,” the spirit said. “The first to catch it wins.”

Shalini stepped forward, grim-faced.

“I’ll take that one,” she said.

No one contested her, as the superficial of her contract were an open secret.

Bargaining was brisk and successful. The spirit opened its mouth, spitting out a fly the size of a bullet, and as it buzzed away Shalini shot the spirit in the eye faster than Angharad could follow. It screamed in anger, turning on her, but she ignored it and shot forward herself. It was a harsh trade: just before Shalini’s fingers closed around the fly, the spirit’s long barbed tongue darted out and ripped into her shoulder. The spirit cursed around its own tongue, lips flapping, but there was no denying the fly was in the Someshwari’s hand.

“We’re done,” she grunted. “Get that goddamn tongue out of me.”

Her lips thinned until they turned bloodless as the spirit did exactly as she had asked, none too gently. The barbs, Angharad saw, did more damage on the way out than they had going in. The wound is still shallow, she thought. It was meant to inflict pain, not cripple. Had Shalini Goel used her contract once or twice, Angharad wondered? That shot had been too quick to be anything but that, but her hand when she had snatched the fly had been barely any slower.

“Oh,” Lan faintly said from behind her. “That can’t be good.”

Angharad followed the Tianxi’s eyes and went still. The spirit they had just beaten had not even returned to its stone yet already the marker ahead of them had cracked open – revealing some sort of cat made of worms.

So had the two markers beyond that one, their spirits coming out.

A spirit shaped like skinless, one-legged man let out a resounding scream and only ceased when the worm-cat leaped at its throat and tried to rip into it. The last spirit, a black horse whose back turned into a spider’s, struck at both with its hooves.

Lord Ishaan had claimed that Shalini’s contract drew attention, Angharad recalled as she watched the spirits begin to tear into each other. Her use of it so close when they were starved must have whipped them into a frenzy.

“Well now,” Tupoc drawled. “That does simply things.”

“No,” Song suddenly said. “Look at the bridge.”

Cracks were spreading, Angharad saw. Every time a spirit tore into another, wounded what they were, the part of the bridge their marker held together began to break.

“We need to run,” she said. “Now.”

Within three steps the first chunk of bridge had fallen.

Angharad glimpsed ahead, taking a hard left when she saw she’d been about to fall into the river as a hole opened in the floor. Ishaan looked about to tip over the edge so she yanked him back, then dragged him along with her. The man tried to thank her but she kept moving. Cracks spread, louder and louder as the bridge began collapsing behind them. It was blind, heedless run forward that Angharad broke only by feverish glimpses forward – never more than half a second, taking hard turns to avoid death.

The cat spirit let out a scream as its head was gobbled down by the horse-spider, its entire chunk of the bridge falling down behind them.

“Go, go, go,” Angharad exhorted the others.

By the time they’d reached the brawling pair, the skinless man was biting into the other’s flesh with too-large square teeth. It turned when Shalini approached, as if drawn by the feel of her, but the other spirit used the distraction to cave in its bare ribs. The bridge ahead of them began to collapse but they were already there, already running and…

Angharad leapt, shouting at the top of her lungs, and the others followed behind.

She landed on her belly, chin hitting the stone painfully, and barely got out of the way before Tupoc landed in a crouch where her legs had been. Angharad hastily rose to her feet, counting the survivors, and as the number rose her hopes did – ten, eleven, twelve. They had all made it, she realized in a moment of pure joy as she watched Lady Ferranda drag Shalini up from the ledge she’d been hanging onto.

“Sleeping God,” she smiled. “We-”

A cracking sound interrupted her, whisking away the joy.

She turned, hand on her sword, as the marked revealed the last spirit. The last test. Her belly clenched in anticipation. It was not as wrong as some of the others, not wicked or warped. The spirit looked almost like a whale that had grown four legs, all pale wet flesh – though it was smaller than any whale known to man, barely the size of a horse. Its breathing was loud, and when it opened its mouth it was to reveal rows on rows of teeth so fine they looked like hair.

“Two must face me and not bleed,” the spirit said. “Until you have wounded me thrice. Any who bleed before then surrender their lantern.”

The voice was slow, lazy, and Angharad blinked away a wave of exhaustion as her veins suddenly cooled. The Fisher was not pleased by the other spirit’s encroachment, she could tell. It would only grow angrier if the spirit persisted, she thought, and so that made her a natural choice for this test.

“I will make one,” Angharad said, stepping forward.

“And I the second.”

Her jaw clenched as Tupoc Xical swaggered up, spear on his shoulder. For all her hatred of the man, he was a skilled fighter. If there was to be a test of martial strength, she would not turn him away. Pushing aside her reluctance, she acknowledged him with a nod. He returned it, along with a smirk that had her considering throttling.

“Let us discuss terms, honored elder,” Angharad said.

The spirit was not interested in trading time for fewer hits, or making assurances too precise about what it might use to pursue them. It only conceded it would not shrink the space of the bridge.

“There will be a trick to hitting it,” Tupoc told her.

“I expect there will be,” Angharad said, and breathed in.

(Angharad Tredegar and Tupoc Xical accepted the terms, beginning the test.

The spirit was quick for its size, charging without batting an eye, but neither its opponents were amateurs. They danced around it as it struck with tail and grasping maw, Tupoc scoring a blow on its side. Only the flesh did not part. The spirit brushed against Angharad a heartbeat later and a spear wound erupted into her side, surrendering her soul. She forced herself to continue, to buy passage for the others. Twice she struck at the spirit, now with nothing to lose – first managing a deep slash into the side that parted no flesh, and then an enraged thrust as the spirit’s forehead.

Which parted flesh like a wide, deep slash.)

Angharad breathed out, shivering for the sudden cold in her veins.

“Do not let it touch you, not even in passing,” she ordered.

“I love it when you give me orders, Tredegar,” Tupoc replied, winking at her.

She ignored that. The spirit’s power was the delay of one wound, Angharad decided. Only while the wound was being delayed, the spirit could give it to one of them instead through contact. A difficult trick to beat if you were unaware of it. Lucky for them, they were not.

The spirit was as quick as it had been in her vision, but not quicker than her.

Cold burned in her veins, keeping exhaustion at bay, and whatever god had blessed Tupoc it seemed no more inclined to let the Izcalli be slowed down. Angharad played the bait, slowing until the spirit charged, and only ran when it had begun to move. The creature slid, trying to turn to catch her, and that was enough od an opening for Tupoc to peck at its back. The Pereduri hazarded a shallow slash as she cut close to the spirit, earning a shallow thrust wound for her trouble, and Tupoc’s pale gaze fell right on it.

The Izcalli figured it out in a heartbeat, not needing a word.

After that, they made sport of their enemy. It moved predictably enough, slowing only to swat with its tail and snapping its mouth whenever they came close, which let Tupoc blind an eye – turning into her shallow slash – and even as the spirit roared in anger Angharad ducked under a tail swing to rise into a smooth pivot. She cut through the side of the tail with a textbook perfect cut, though it only unleashed a pierced hole into the flesh.

It was, however, undeniably a third wound.

The spirit turned on them in a fury.

“You tricked me,” it accused.

“I did not fall prey to your tricks,” Angharad plainly corrected. “Your wrath rings hollow, honored elder.”

She walked right past the spirit, ignoring Tupoc’s delighted laugh, and went to claim the prize promised her: a way out of the nightmare.

—

The end. They’d finally got to the end of the maze, damn the blood-hungry thing.

Sweat pouring down her back, Angharad climbed the wide stairs and found she barely begrudged Tupoc’s presence at her side. He too was a victor twice over. She could return to despising him when he next opened his mouth. The gentle slope ended on flat grounds in the uneven make of nature’s hand, the old cavern floor bereft of so much as a speck of life. There were only two things here: a wall of hanging lanterns and a gate.

There must have been hundreds of the lanterns, thousands – and though many were of the same cheap iron stock the Watch had given them at the Old Fort, not all were. There was brass and bronze, elaborate silver filigree and even an exquisite thing of sculpted glass shaped like a flower. The flames were pale and they burned even though not all lanterns had wick or air. Angharad could not decide which was more unsettling: the unnaturalness of that, or that not all flames burned even. Some were bright, others guttering out. Were there other lanterns gone dark, just out of sight?

Shaking herself out of the musings, the Pereduri moved her eye back to the gate. It had seemed tall from a distance, but from here it was outright colossal. Tall as three dozen men, half as broad, and its curved head ended in a great lion’s head holding a knocker in its mouth. Angharad looked for a hinge or a keyhole, but all the great panes of bronze displayed was elaborate wrought iron patterns of curving snakes and flowers.

“The floor, Tredegar,” Tupoc said. “Unless you intend on gawping all night?”

Angharad duly resumed despising him, as had been foretold. He was not wrong about the floor, however: there were circles of bronze set in it, themselves tracing a greater circle before the gate. Ten circles, to be precise, and that could not be a coincidence. Their slowing gait had allowed the first of the others to catch up, so Lord Zenzele soon let out a sigh as he caught up to her.

“Would it have killed that fat Tianxi to tell us what precisely was needed to open the gate?” he said. “I must confess I am not greatly in the mood for a spot of occult mystery.”

“The Watch did tell us.”

Angharad’s gaze slid to the speaker, who she had not expected to come forward on her own. Lan looked as exhausted as she herself felt, but her eyes were sharp.

“A bold claim,” Zenzele Duma said. “Do elaborate.”

“They gave us one thing before we set out,” the Tianxi said. “You think it’s a coincidence they’re also hanging off the wall here, Malani?”

The blue-lipped woman cleared her throat.

“Lady Tredegar, would you please place your lantern in one of the circles?”

Angharad frowned, but she could see no reason to refuse. Though the blackcloaks had said the lantern touched with their blood was for spirits to find them in the aether – and feed on them should they lose – the golden light of the aetheric machine above would prevent such mischief. She walked to the closest bronze circle even as she went through her pack, lightly setting the lantern down in the middle. She stepped back afterwards, wary, but nothing at all happened. Three heartbeats passed.

“I thought you’d have taunted me by now,” Lan candidly admitted to Zenzele.

“I thought to wait for Ferranda so-”

A flame, pale and bright, suddenly lit up inside Angharad’s lantern.

“That is to say,” Lord Zenzele corrected midstride, “well done, Lan, capital work.”

By now the others had caught up, and the method was laid out other victors began to set down their own lantern. Isabel was the first after Angharad, and the Pereduri kept her eye on the gate as the infanzona’s lantern lit up. No movement at all. They had precisely ten victors out of their survivors, so ten lanterns were set down. Ishaan’s was the last, and it was placed within the circle Angharad idly glimpsed ahead.

/A flame within the iron, the lionhead’s mouth opening, the flames winking out and then nothing./

She swallowed her fear. The mirror-dancer bared her blade even as the bronze lionhead came to life, eyes turning to her. Then then the golden light above, their constant companion, went out like a snuffed candle. The barest instant after, so did the hundreds of lanterns on the wall.

Angharad had not seen nothing, she realized, but the dark.

Shouts of fear and dismay echoed, blades being bared and even a shot fired blindly – or perhaps not so blindly, as the sound of a bullet on metal echoed. Had Shalini snapped a shot? If she had, it did not stop the spirit in the gate for they all heard something massive landing before them.

“Gets your lanterns out,” Angharad shouted. “Your real ones.”

It was a madman’s whirl after that, everyone scattering as the spirit charged – feeling so much larger than it had as a mere head, even were a matching body attached to it. Angharad glimpsed ahead once, twice. She used not her eyes to guide herself, for she saw nothing, but the pain of being mauled should she misstep. She found the spirit, or close enough, and felt wind as is struck at her but came short. Was it blind to the dark as well?

“Here,” she shouted. “It is here.”

A shot flashed through the dark, revealing for a heartbeat the hulking shape of a bronze lion large as a carriage as the bullet went wide. The spirit turned in a moment, striking out, but Angharad threw herself out of the way. Her shoulder landed badly on the stone and she swallowed a hiss as something tore through where she had just been standing.

“I despise cats,” Tupoc noted in the distance, then raised his voice. “Over here, you rusty old thing.”

The spirit roared, leaping his way, and Angharad saw it for some blessed soul had finally gotten a lantern lit. Song, silver eyes steady, had set her lantern on the ground and was already loading her musket. Tupoc, meanwhile, laughed as he danced around swiping claws and – the shots were in such quick succession Angharad almost thought there had only been the one. Instead she saw Shalini drop her fourth pistol with an incredulous look. The Someshwari did not even carry four, Ishaan had his arms raised to make it easier for his companion to snatch his.

The bronze lion roared again, turning, and Angharad saw that enough bullets had landed in his right eye to cave it in. Not that it seemed to slow it down any.

“Powder won’t work,” Lady Ferranda shouted. “Blades out!”

In the flickering lantern light, they went after the spirit. Tupoc and Angharad were quickest and so they led the dance – darting in and out of the bronze lion’s reach. It was slow, the mirror-dancer realized, and did not see well. But it struck with the strength of a dozen men and it was made of fucking bronze. Twice she scored slashes on its face and side, earning only a line, and none of the others did better save for Brun whose hatchet sunk deep enough into the spirit’s head he was not able to wrench it back out. It tossed him away with a swipe of its tail, the Sacromontan falling to the ground with a scream, and others were not far behind.

Ferranda was hit by the spirit’s shoulder as it ran and went flying as if it had been a battering ram, unconscious on impact.

“On me,” Angharad hissed at the monster, striking at its sculpted mane.

From the corner of her eye she saw Lan drag away the infanzona, but it was all spinning out of control. They were losing, could not get past the bronze.

“Your contract,” Lord Zenzele shouted. “Nair, you need to use your contract.”

“Fuck,” Lord Ishaan Nair cursed, closing his eyes.

And a miracle happened: the lion went still.

At least until Ishaan started screaming.

“Kill it,” Shalini screamed. “Kill it now or his brain will melt and-”

Tupoc rammed his spear into the lion’s dented eye, plunging through bronze until the shaft was a third through. He grunted with effort, tanned muscles clenching as he pushed as far as he could into the creature’s head.

The lion stilled and Ishaan stopped screaming.

Had they… had they done it? Another two heartbeats passed and the lion did not move. It must be dead, Angharad thought, though only Song would be able to confirm that –  and where was Song? She had not fought, not even fired the musket Angharad had seen her loading. She could not think the Tianxi a coward, so something must have happened. Was she… Gaze sweeping the cavern to the edge of the light, Angharad found no trace of her. It was only beyond that cast that she glimpsed movement. Song had climbed the wall unhooked a lantern.

As Angharad watched a pale, bright flame lit up inside.

“Ren, what are you doing?” Lan called out from below. “Your cursed fool you’ll-”

“No,” Song shouted, “Xical, don’t-”

Angharad’s gaze went to Tupoc, who she found was merely laying a foot on the lion to prepare to rip out his spear. She moved to stop him, trusting in Song, but the Izcalli was quicker. The spear came free, and for a heartbeat nothing at all happened.

Then the bronze lion moved.

It wasn’t dead, Angharad realized with horror. Ishaan’s contract only forced it asleep. The Someshwari had been failing in the contest of minds before Tupoc’s spear went into the skull, which had distracted the spirit enough for the contract to win that contest. Only now the pain of the same spear being ripped out had awoken it. The Izcalli went down, slapped away, and Angharad struck at the lion’s back.

“Ishaan,” she screamed, “you must-”

The lion ignored her, the thin scar she inflicted in its back, and bounded forward. Once, twice and on the third bound its jaw snapped closed.

Ishaan’s head popped like a grape, a mess of red and grey that the lion swallowed whole.

Shalini let out a heartrending sound, like her soul had been ripped out, and stabbed at the spirit with a knife. It bounced off the bronze, too blindly struck. Angharad pursued, shouting to draw the monster’s attention, and after a final wet gulp it deigned to turn towards her. Zenzele dragged Shalini away. Fighting her for every step.

Angharad faced the spirit, breathing out, and knew all she had left was-

The lantern’s arc was perfect, a thing of beauty. The iron box Song had thrown struck the lion on the side of the head, impossibly shattering like glass, and there was a burst of pale light as the flame within flared up. The spirit roared, screamed, but the pale fire spread across its bronze body and blackened the metal. It struggled and twisted, but inch by inch it was devoured by the bright flame until there was nothing left but a blackened husk.

And when at last the pale fire guttered out, in the distance the great bronze gate began to open.

The sound, Angharad found, could not quite drown out Shalini’s sobs.

—

They did not linger.

Shalini took up her friend’s body, after wrapping it so the lack of head would be hidden, and would not hear of being helped.

Beyond the gates lay a hallway, little more than a tunnel sloping upwards. There were no torches here, no light but what they brought with them. Yet Angharad saw that what waited at the end of the hallway was a different kind of darkness from the one behind them – lighter, airier. It was the outside. Sleeping God, Angharad thought, but she was finally going to feel the wind on her face again. She hurried up the stairs, the light of the lanterns trailing behind, until her legs ached and there were no more steps left to climb.

Past the edge of the hall waited a long drop, mere feet of ground before the sheer drop of a cliff. And yet Angharad grinned, for above her twinkled the distant stars of firmament.

They were out, finally out.

Song was the first to join her, musket still at the ready. Together they caught sight of the lights in the distance. Far to the north, past thick woods, where a port was tucked away and waited the ships that would take them away from the Dominion of Lost Things. A cliffside path to their left led that way, snaking down towards the bottom of the mountain and the darkness below. To their right, their west, awaited something better: rest.

A fort jutted out of the mountainside, a tower at its summit burning bright and pale. More tempting still were the yellow lanterns around the fort, the marks of sanctuary. Blackcloaks would await them there, Angharad thought, with beds and food and safety before they ventured into the horrors of the Trial of Weeds.

“Come on,” Song said, brushing their shoulders together. “I could do with a good’s night sleep after this bastard of a day.”

“So could I,” Angharad fervently replied.

She glanced back, seeing the others were catching up.

They felt it before they heard the noise.

The shiver going through the ground, the feeling of something breaking. Then there was that catastrophic, deafening crack as the very earth shook under their feet. Angharad barely stayed on her feet, and caught Song so she would not fall.

“Oh Gods,” the Tianxi breathed out.

Angharad followed the silver gaze, which had come to rest behind them and above their heads. For a heartbeat she understood nothing, and then she saw it too: the crown of the mountain above them had just gone down. The ground shook again, the roar of breaking stone crashing against their ears. The mountain, she realized was crumpling from the inside. Caving in. And as a third great heave threw them both against the ground, the mountain’s crown fell all the way down – disappearing from their side. Angharad stayed there gaping until she was shaken out of it.

“- up, we need to go,” someone shouted, dragging her up.

She followed, struck dumb, and saw it all fall apart.

On the mountainside, chunks of stone began to fall. To roll down the slopes. A landslide, one so large as to defy descriptions.

She did not stay long enough to it swallow up the Watch’s mountainside fort, they were already running towards the woods by then, but she heard it. There could be no doubt.

Sanctuary lay buried under a cairn of stones, and thus began the Trial of Weeds.

# Chapter 37

The thing about weakness was that there was absolutely nothing redeeming about it.

Everyone loved a good picaresca story, in Sacromonte. Tales of a roguish man of scandalously common breeding getting the better of his betters. Swindling greedy merchants out of their wealth, tricking vain ladies and pompous lords into humiliating themselves. And it was not a taste that ended at the borders of the Murk or even the Old Town. Infanzones, they liked the songs and poems about rats same as the rest of the city. Their smile, though, it had a bit of smirk to it around the corners.

Because they understood that the stories were just that, that when a witty wastrel won in the stories because life in the streets taught them to be clever it was just what people wanted to be true. In the world they lived in the clever rogues got caught, shot in the head and dumped in the canals. There was nothing meaningful about being poor and hungry and afraid no higher meaning to it. Weakness was not a trial with a reward at the end, it was just being weak.

And Tristan was weak.

He wouldn’t hide from that truth, that would just get him killed. He’d always need the edge: the poison and the dagger, the lie and the quiet feet in the dark. He’d always be the rat, scurrying around the boots of men. He’d almost forgot that, in these trials. He’d won too many petty victories, found too much respect in the eyes of others. He’d been awakened from that dream, though, and though it had been a rough awakening he was almost thankful Lieutenant Vasanti for it.

There was nothing like bargaining your treatment down to torture to remind you of your place in the order of things.

Yet Tristan had lived, bought his way out of the grave again, and now he must ensure that he would not be thrown back in it once his enemies had what they wanted from him. Once he was no longer useful and their reason for taking the finger off the trigger passed.

So in the dark before the other rose, after what little sleep he had stolen from his bruised and aching body, the rat scratched up a plan against the walls of his mind. What did he want? To live. To keep his crew alive if he could. Maryam first, then the others.

Under pale light he might have been ashamed of that brutal truth, but alone in the dark with the pain he felt not a flicker of guilt. It would wait until he no longer tasted blood in his mouth.

Second, Vasanti must die or be forced off the board. The old lieutenant must be put in a position where she could no longer come for him, not even if she burned all her last bridges to get one last swing at him. She had already tried to get him killed twice and her hatred of Abuela would have driven her to try again even if Tristan had not indirectly helped her slip a noose around her own neck.

Two wants was enough. More would be greedy, scattering his focus. So what was in the way?

The god in the pillar. Lieutenant Wen, who would not suffer violence against blackcloaks until it was dealt by the hand of the law. Vasanti herself, who was sure to sabotage him if she could – until she could do worse. Yong, who would turn on him if selling Tristan’s hide guaranteed getting to the third trial and keeping his husband alive.

Maryam? No, her own wants came after the Trial of Weeds. She was a help. Francho would murder to survive, and perhaps even for convenience, but so would most everyone Tristan had ever known. The old man’s contract would be even more important than Yong’s musket and Maryam’s Signs anyhow.

There were greater dooms looming in the distance, the Red Maw and his oath to Wen and whatever awaited beyond the Trial of Weeds, but these did not matter. One grave at a time.

Tristan turned in his cot, grey eyes open as he looked at the stone above him. He was not alone. Fortuna, sitting against the wall to his side with her dress like a pool of silk at her feet, kept him company in silence. Golden eyes under a golden crown he thought, taking in the sight of her for the span of a breath. Like a painting come to life. His eye returned to the stone, the claws inside his mind scratching at the walls.

He stayed like that a long time, his body a dull ache, until finally he saw how the pieces fit together. Only then did the rat close his eyes.

“To join the court of cats,” Tristan Abrascal softly sang, smiling.

Sleep snuck up on him.

—

In the small hours before morning, before the others woke, Tristan was handed a small cup of milky white poison.

It didn’t look that way when they sold on the streets. The black tea that the coteries served in their dens was as dark as the name implied and socorro tincture, that purported miracle drug that claimed to heal anything from the cough to impotence, was red-brown. Both of those were cut with other substances, especially socorro – which every charlatan and street witch from the Murk to the Orchard claimed to have a potent family recipe for. It all came back to the same plant, though: the poppy.

Tristan had seen the fruits of that bud hollow out too many men to ever trust it, but he made himself drink the extract anyway.

The thugs had left few visible marks during his talks with Lieutenant Vasanti, but he had been savagely beaten and his body still felt like it. If he was to be able to move the way he needed to, he would the pain taken care of. Hence, poppy extract. It would not make up for the sleeplessness lurking behind his eyes, yanking his thoughts one way and the other, but he would handle that himself. The few bruised, intermittent hours of sleep he had grabbed after making his plans would have to tide him over until he could collapse.

“I recommend against marrying the poppy to substances from your box,” the Watch physician said, stroking his sparse beard. “Though I expect you know better than that.”

“I do,” Tristan said.

There was nothing left in there but the bearded cat tincture and the medical turpentine anyhow, not after Vanesa’s last farewell. He had already moved the last vials to his bag along with the few medical supplies he’d wheedled out of the Watch, abandoning the box itself as dead weight. And to think mere days ago he had killed a man for that pile of broken wood. How quickly such worth was spent, though that should not have come as a surprise.

In Sacromonte, lives could always be had on the cheap.

The Watch doctor nodded a farewell at him, then packed up his kit and left. The thief rolled his shoulders a little, wincing at the sensation, then finally turned to meet the gaze of the other man present. The one he needed to bargain with so he might begin setting the board, and fortunately the one who had wanted to speak with him. Best to begin with that, if only to fish for leverage.

“You wanted a word?” Tristan said.

“Something like that,” Lieutenant Wen replied.

The Tianxi with the golden frames was, for once, not eating. He might have called that an ill-omen, were Wen not already inherently such.

“I am all ears, then.”

Wen studied him for some time, then sighed. He went fishing around the pocket of his vest, pulling out a bronze grandfather pocket watch tied to a chain. It was a simple but lovely piece, still ticking away dutifully. The thief stilled, for he had seen it before – most often during the Trial of Lines.

“That is Vanesa’s watch.”

“It is,” Lieutenant Wen said, and threw it.

Tristan panicked, but even dulled his reflexes were better than most. He caught the chain, then the rest, and sent a dark look the fat Tianxi’s way. Not that the watchman seemed to care.

“It’s yours,” Lieutenant Wen said.

He frowned, looking for the trap.

“Why?”

The watchman snorted.

“Because the old girl must have emptied your stocks killing that Aztlan tough,” Wen said. “He died quick and ugly.”

Tristan smoothed away his worry, painting confusion on his face instead.

“My stocks?”

The lieutenant sighed, taking off his spectacles to clean them with a ragged silk kerchief he dragged out of his sleeve.

“Alvareno’s Dosages is a required reading for Cryptics, you shifty little prick,” Wen amiably said. “I know a poison box when I see one.”

Tristan swallowed. There were only so many reasons for the lieutenant to know that.

“Are you…”

Wen had spoken contemptuously of Masks before, but that might have been to hide his tracks.

“Do you think I’d tell you if I were Krypteia?” Wen replied, amused.

A fair point, the thief mentally conceded. The Tianxi dismissed the notion with a wave a heartbeat later.

“I never cared for the cloak and dagger games,” Wen said. “I’m a good Arthasastra boy, we don’t partake.”

Tristan slowly blinked. As in the Arthasastra Society, the Circle of the Watch that trained diplomats?

“You’re a Laurel,” he said, not hiding his skepticism.

“Historian track, to be exact,” Lieutenant Wen amusedly replied. “Our society’s got the broadest remit of the entire College, Tristan, we’re not all translators and negotiators.”

Wen had seemed unusually well-versed in the history of the Watch. Besides, even if the man was lying it hardly mattered. Fingers closing around the watch, feeling the faint ticking beneath, Tristan bowed his head.

“Thank you,” he said.

The older man stared him down.

“She died well,” Wen said. “Sometimes that’s the best you can hope for.”

There’s no such thing as a good death, Tristan thought. We all shit ourselves and get thrown in a canal when the rot starts to stink. There’s nothing noble about rot, Wen. It’s just the meat that used to be a person going bad. But the thought of leaving Vanesa’s watch in the hands of strangers seemed disrespectful, somehow, so he put it away inside his own pocket. There would be time to fasten it properly later.

“You’ve buttered me up properly,” Tristan acknowledged. “Shall we now tuck into the meal?”

“A poor choice of words, on an island with a history of cannibalism,” Wen noted, sounding amused. “But if you insist.”

Manes, was there anything on this island that didn’t eat people? It was bad enough Tristan was going to have to rely on the fact for his plans. The lieutenant, at last satisfied with spectacles that had been largely spotless when he began cleaning them, slid them back on. It made his eyes colder, somehow, for them to be framed in gold.

“Do you still intend to try for the lift?” the lieutenant asked.

It was phrased as a question, a choice, but Tristan knew better. Wen had extended him help and protection only in exchange for his sabotaging the aetheric machine above. If he went back on his word now there would be consequences. The maze is suicide for us anyhow, he thought. Yong, Maryam, Francho and himself was not fine enough a crew to make it all the way across even if they had some idea of a usable path.

“I do,” Tristan said, “but we both know that Vasanti’s new plans mean mine need to be adjusted. I have a concern.”

Bait.

“You’re afraid that she’ll find the lift,” Wen stated.

Bait taken. I’m not, Tristan thought. She thinks she has the solution to the front gates and the last thing she needs is more dead blackcloaks. She’ll be religious about sticking to the tiles room and walking right back out.

“It would be the end of my plans,” Tristan said. “I need to take some precautions, Wen. And to do that I need access to the pillar.”

Wen frowned at him.

“There are only two stone keys to that door,” he said. “Vasanti keeps both on her.”

And she was unlikely to share them even if politely asked. Fortunately for them there was no need to go begging.

“There are only two known keys to the door,” Tristan corrected.

They’d not found the stone button in his boot. The fat Tianxi blinked, then let out a startled laugh.

“You have a third,” he deduced. “So what is it that you need from me, then?”

“To get up there unseen,” Tristan said. “Vasanti means to hit the pillar come morning, so it’s certain to be under guard right now.”

“I could arrange that,” the lieutenant agreed. “Get my people in place, tell them to look elsewhere.”

He then narrowed his eyes from behind that thin lens of glass.

“And I will, if you tell me what you’ll be up to in there,” Lieutenant Wen said. “I won’t be party to attacks on watchmen, boy.”

Wen’s line in the sand. Wen’s lever. Learn what people love and you will know how to move them, Abuela’s voice whispered into his ear.

“I don’t have anything I can hurt the Watch with,” Tristan lied. “I only intend to jam the door with the broken lock.”

The lieutenant studied him, looking for the lie, but he wouldn’t find it. Tristan’s mind felt like a door without a hinge – every passing thing winding through, without regard to need or sense. The Tianxi might as well have tried to read a whirlpool.

“Sensible,” Wen said. “And the god inside?”

“Another concern,” the thief smiled winningly. “Which leads me to my final request.”

Lieutenant Wen cocked an eyebrow over his spectacles.

“This ought to be good.”

“I need,” Tristan said, “a human leg.”

And given how many watchmen had died fighting the god earlier, at least he could count on supply beating demand.

—

“You should have asked for an arm,” Fortuna opined. “It would have been easier to carry.”

Tristan duly ignored her. He’d glimpsed the leg he now carried wrapped in cloth earlier and noted it was half-charred, likely hacked off a corpse on the great funeral pyre the Watch had made outside the Old Fort – in the same place Inyoni had been burned. They must not have had enough wood to keep it blazing long enough for all the corpses to be turned to ash.

As the nearest woods were full of bloodthirsty cultists, this was understandable.

With Wen giving a few orders the thief’s path up the rope ladder was cleared and there was no one keeping watch on the stairs. Good. He could afford no witnesses for this. The last stone button unlocked the door, and once it popped open he hastily claimed the key back before shoving it into a pocket. No teeth sought to chomp down on him, so Tristan went ahead with the first part of his plan: tossed the leg out into the room.

“Dinner’s served,” he called out.

“Wow,” Fortuna muttered. “That got dark.”

He’d told Wen he needed the dead flesh to hide his scent, keep the god off him. The truth was that he needed it for the very opposite reason: he needed the god to come, and the smell of meat was his best chance at ensuring that.

“I need you to keep watch out in the tile room,” Tristan told Fortuna. “The moment it gets close, tell me.”

He would need to be able to close the door in a heartbeat when the god approached, as he doubted that offering of a leg would keep the deity from trying to eat him.

“I don’t want to be alone in a room with a dead leg,” Fortuna whined.

“You won’t be,” Tristan assured her with a winning smile. “There will also be a terrifying ancient god trying to eat us.”

“Ugh,” the Lady of Long Odds sniffed. “It better not get anything on my dress.”

Tristan opened his mouth, about to ask whether her dress could actually be dirtied – or cleaned – but then he caught the gleam in her eye and his mouth snapped shut. She was only trying to get a rise out of him. Not that she stopped afterwards, complaining about everything from the lighting being unflattering to the leg facing the wrong way, but at least she kept watch as he had asked.

The minutes passed, one after another, and his shoulders tensed. If he could not speak with the god, if he could not join that cat’s court…

But after more than half an hour had passed, the leg did what it was meant to.

“Company,” Fortuna warned, then cocked her head to the side. “Oh, that looks nasty.”

She fled into the wall a moment later as darkness slithered into the room on quiet feet.

Tristan pushed the door until it was but a finger’s breadth away from closing. He felt like a child closing the closet door to keep the monster at bay, but the monster here was not of his own making: through the thin length kept open he glimpsed the god moving, all slimy dark scales past a flash of yellow eyes. It was the teeth that had him shuddering in revulsion, though still startlingly human-like for all that each was the size of a hand. The god gobbled up the dead leg with nary a sound.

“It’s lost a leg,” Fortuna whispered in his ear. “Must have been salt munitions, it’s not healing.”

However slight her whisper, it was still heard.

“The vermin has learned unexpected tricks,” the god chuckled.

Its voice was smooth and lovely, almost like a singer’s. It made you want to lean in, to listen closer. Tristan grit his teeth. The Red Maw had not made a meal of him, neither would this lesser thing. The thief put himself together, breathing out and steadying his back.

“God of the land,” he smilingly said, “I greet you.”

The god – that horrid reptilian thing – laughed, laughed like a infanzona who had just seen a little monkey do a clever trick.

“Oh, Tristan,” the god crooned. “Is it a test you’ve come for, like those the shackled beasts below offer to you lost souls?”

It came closer, until its humid and fetid breath came like a whisper through the crack.

“Come closer and I shall give you a game, I promise.”

And the voice, the way it spoke, made it sound tempting even though it was utter madness sure to end in his death.

“I’ve a dislike for playing the games of others, I must confess,” Tristan said. “It is a bargain I came for.”

A mocking rictus that he only glimpsed, rows of white teeth over too-red lips.

“You need only come closer,” the god silkily said, “and you will have everything you need.”

Fortuna popped her head out of the wall.

“He’s lying,” she helpfully said. “He’s going to eat you.”

Tristan sighed.

“Thank you, Fortuna,” he replied.

“Just looking out for you,” she smugly said.

He suspected that if she had enough reach to pat herself on the back in that dress she would have. The god had gotten close, during that short distraction, edged in. He began to close the door and it froze. Ah, so it did want to talk. At least as long as eating him when he slipped up was on the table.

“I do not have a name to call you by,” Tristan said. “Would you care to remedy this, god of the land?”

“How polite,” the god drawled. “You may call me Boria.”

That word, that name, it rippled. Echoed. And when Tristan heard it, all he could thought was that he should step out. The god was tricking him, but it was wounded. Weak. And had he not beaten starker odds than this? It would be easier to bargain from there, and if it turned in him then his wits would be enough to… Nails dug into his palm as the thief breathed out shallowly.

Enough. Enough? Had he ever once in his life held enough in his hand that a victory had come cheap? He turned inwards, sharpened himself.

“You are,” he said, “a god of arrogance.”

Fortuna fanned herself, leaning against the wall to his side. She looked disdainful.

“The kind that dooms you,” she said. “Very specific.”

“Amusing, coming from the likes of you,” Boria laughed.

The goddess huffed up like an offended cat.

“Let us not lose ourselves in the weeds,” Tristan hastily said before she could throw a fit. “I’m not so sure you have the time for it, Boria. You have troubles.”

“Not even the touch of the Glare can still me forever,” the god scoffed. “I will return in full splendor and take my revenge upon those who dared to wound me.”

“Ah, but it may well be that the Watch comes for you first,” Tristan said. “They have discovered some of the secrets of this place.”

“And what is that to me?” Boria dismissed.

The thief did not answer that immediately. He would first, he thought, need to crack the shell. Just like eating crab.

“I thought you might the Red Maw for a time, did you now?” Tristan said. “Because of the tongue and that fearsome throat of yours. I only knew for sure it was untrue when I returned yesterday and heard the Watch had chased you off.”

Nothing so fearsome as the Maw could have been chased off my muskets, no matter how much salt was loaded into it. It had been confirmed later when he saw the projection of the machine on the other side of the pillar and how massive that entity had become.

“You spend my patience,” Boria warned.

“So I’ve since had to wonder about,” Tristan continued, unruffled, “why it is you’re here at all.”

The god did not answer.

“You’re not bound by the golden light and its rules while in the pillar, that’s true,” Tristan said. “But you’re not here by choice either, are you? You’re starving, Boria. I must have been the first piece of fresh meat you saw in centuries.”

Silence. The god watched him patiently, waiting for an opening. A way to gobble him up.

“The devils put you in here,” the thief said. “After they fiddled with the rules of the golden machine they stranded you inside the pillar and sealed the doors, knowing you’d be so fucking starved of fresh meat that you would attack anyone coming in like a good guard dog.”

This entire mountain, Tristan thought, had been turned into a sandpit for the Red Maw. The devils had created a makeshift seal by piling up gods atop the Maw and forcing them to feed on it through the rules imposed by the golden light, and when the Watch had evicted them from the island they’d sealed the doors behind them so the blackcloaks would not be able to accidentally undo their seal by tinkering with the aetheric machine.

And then, just to be sure no wily vermin would burrow their way to trouble, they’d tossed a starving god inside so it would eat whatever made it in.

Tristan went still as darkness billowed out, filling the entire room on the other side of the door until there was nothing at all left but dark and a great, unblinking poisonously yellow eye. It was close, so close he almost closed the door in a fit of fear. He mastered himself at the last moment.

“And it occurs to me,” Tristan said, “that these devils, they were meticulous. Paranoid almost.”

He met that unblinking eldritch gaze.

“That maybe they would have made it so there would a punishment for the guardian should the treasures within be stolen,” he said.

A collar for the guard dog, so to speak. The thief made himself smile bright and wide.

“But worry not, my friend,” he said. “For I have come to bargain out of the goodness of my heart to help you avoid such a grisly fate.”

Darkness thinned.

“And why,” Boria asked, “would that be?”

It was breathing in, as if tasting the air.

“The leader of those would breach the pillar is a woman who wants me dead,” Tristan said. “I would return the favor.”

 Darkness thinned further and further, until once more the thief saw the terrible creature before him.

“Speak,” the god ordered.

—

The door closed, not even the barest of cracks open between he and Boria.  Tristan allowed himself to sag against the wall, shivering as if out in the cold, and closed his eyes as he forced his breathing to settle.

“Now what?” Fortuna asked, sounding curious.

In and out, until calm returned. Ten more breaths passed before the worst of the fear had left him, before he felt ready to speak.

“Now we walk to Wen again,” he replied, “so that the last piece is put into place.”

—

The trick to making someone give you something for nothing was to make it so that every other decision was worse.

It was not a surefire trick, of course, though what was? Sometimes the mark would refuse out of spite or make a worse decision because fear or anger. People were not the automatons of story, making every call with clockwork precision and choosing to mitigate damage rather than stick a knife in their enemy on the way down. Tristan, however, had rubbed elbows with Lieutenant Wen enough to get a decent read on the man. The fat man was a practical soul, more interested in results than means, and his moral compass was clannish as any coterie man’s: there was the Watch, then everyone else.

Tristan had crossed that line in the sand, so he made sure to lie to the man.

“I ought to have you shot,” Wen snarled.

Having a lie almost as offensive as the truth helped, in his experience. When you told a man you’d killed his wife he did not usually think to question whether you’d actually killed his children instead.

“It wouldn’t help,” the thief shrugged. “And it’s an opportunity, isn’t it? To do it on your own terms.”

The bespectacled Tianxi was furious but they both knew that nothing could be done. Or rather that many things could be done, but all of them were worthless. And Tristan, though eminently executable, was still more useful alive than dead. It was enough.

“An opportunity to clean up your mess,” Wen scoffed. “Now I need to speak with Mandisa.”

“Don’t let me keep you,” Tristan said, idly fishing out Vanesa’s watch.

Half past six, he saw after popping the lid. He carefully closed it.

“If you are gone long, this may well be our last conversation,” the thief added/

The lieutenant sneered.

“Are you giving me your sweet farewells, rat?” he asked. “I’m touched.”

Tristan nodded, to the man’s visible surprise.

“I cannot say meeting you was a pleasure,” the thief said, “but it has not been a misfortune. May you fare well in the years to come.”

He even meant it. Lieutenant Wen was a bastard and something of a bully, but his cruelty was shallower than his sense of duty. Had Tristan been part of his tribe, the lives that mattered to the man, then he might even have grown fond of him. A guard hound was loved by the house, not the street.

“You have been nothing but a heap of trouble,” Wen bluntly replied. “Rats always are, it takes us years to beat the Murk out of their bones.”

Then he sighed.

“You’re not unfit for the cloak, though, I will grant,” the lieutenant said. “And your work today will force a good, so prick your ears up.”

Tristan cocked an eyebrow, openly curious.

“When you find your path through,” Wen continued, “be careful if you emerge on the mountainside.”

“Trouble?”

“The hollows on the islands are divided up in tribes,” Wen said. “Those who dwell in the mountains are worst of the Red Eye zealots: they kill on sight and they’ve even scavenged some muskets with the powder to match.”

Which they must have taken from the Watch. By force, as the blackcloaks did not trade guns to the hollows. He let out a low whistle.

“Bold,” Tristan said.

“You don’t know the half of it,” the Tianxi grunted. “They know they can melt back into the mountain paths after, so they’ve even attacked the fort that serves as sanctuary on the other side. It got overrun about a decade ago, all hands lost. The higher-ups ordered a vault built underneath so there’d be somewhere to retreat to if it happened again.”

“I will be sure to keep an eye out, then,” the thief seriously replied. “My thanks for the warning.”

“I don’t need thanks,” Lieutenant Wen said. “I need that machine broken. Get to it, rat.”

—

It was darkly amusing that Lieutenant Vasanti’s stalwarts – numbering a mere eleven watchmen – ate breakfast early and had orders to ensure he was not allowed anywhere near the communal cauldron of porridge. Vanesa’s legacy, he mused. The Someshwari lieutenant ought to have known there was near nothing left in his poison cabinet, since she’d ordered it searched, so in a way it was flattering that she still would not allow Tristan near anywhere food she was to eat.

How resourceful she must think him, to be wary of his making poisons out of thin air.

By the time Vasanti’s crew was finished his own was up and ready. The four of them claimed a table on the other side of the kitchen, busying themselves with stilted talk and cups of grass tea until the blackcloaks were gone and they were finally allowed to fill their own bowls with slop. Tristan forced himself to eat two, knowing he would need the vigor. For all that the blackcloaks would be the ones taking the vanguard he did not expect an easy way of it.

It was only when he set down his spoon after the second bowl that Yong broke the silence.

“All right, I’ll be the one since no one else is stepping up,” the Tianxi said. “What in the fucking Heavens happened last night, Tristan?”

“Vasanti tried to scapegoat me for her blunder in the pillar,” he casually summed up. “She failed to talk the watchmen into having me hanged, so she had to settle for an interrogation.”

Interrogation sounded better than torture. Usually meant the same thing, in his experience, but sounded better. Maryam cocked an eyebrow.

“Which yielded?”

Tristan cleared his throat.

“Remund Cerdan, that villain, stole the brand and hid it before attempting to frame me for this hideous crime,” the rat said. “Once this became obvious, Lieutenant Vasanti and I divined the hiding place together and cleared my name.”

Francho toothlessly grinned, shaking his head as he chuckled.

“A terrible villain, that lad,” the old professor said. “And should this reprehensible character proclaim his innocence?”

“That’d be quite the trick,” Tristan said, “as I saw a rusty piece of steel two inches wide go right through his throat last night.”

It was highly unlikely that anyone had seem him dispose of the Cerdan but not impossible, so he had a second lie prepared just in case. Remund had survived his wounding on the way down but been unable to walk, so he had demanded that Tristan carry him. When refused, the infanzon tried to force him at the point of a pistol. When poor Tristan had tried to wrestle it away from him a shot was fired in the melee, putting Remund to rest.

Remund Cerdan had been a noble, so it was only natural for Tristan to be terrified of the consequences even if it had been an accidental death while defending himself. It was the only reason he had lied.

On the other side of the table, Maryam’s blue eyes were knowing.

“The tunnels past the wheel room, was it?” she said. “I heard Tredegar almost got cut as well, they sound almost as dangerous as a test.”

In the lantern light Maryam’s hard face and long tresses looked as if they had been carved by hatchet, like as not to cut any hand daring to strike those cheekbones. She was pleasing to the eye, Tristan thought, in the way that a good knife was: entirely itself even when at rest, a knife even before it cut. There was something curiously reassuring about that, about having that calm sharpness on your side.

On his side.

It was a small thing, he thought, what she had just done. Helping him sell a lie the others would only barely care about. But it had been unasked for, nothing bargained or offered, and she had done it without batting an eye. It was a small thing but she gained nothing from doing it – it implicated her needlessly, if anything – and that meant it was not a small thing at all. Tristan looked away, clearing his throat.

“My differences with the good lieutenant have been settled,” he said. “Moreover, she now delivers an opportunity: as Vasanti believes she can open the front gate, we can make our own move while she sets out through it with her crew.”

“He expedition might draw the god’s attention and clear our path,” Francho approved.

It would. Tristan had seen to that. It surprised the thief some that it had been the old professor and not Yong who talked of distraction, however. When he turned he found the Tianxi’s dark eyes narrowed and resting on him.

“Put your hand between your shoulder blades, Tristan,” Yong said.

The thief’s face went blank. Lies came his tongue, rich and plentiful, but not a single one they would believe. Three seconds passed, then the Tianxi sighed.

“You can’t, can you?” he said.

“I could,” Tristan said, which was true. “But would rather not.”

Even truer. The poppy milk had taken off the edge, but he has still been thoroughly worked over.

“They beat you halfway to useless,” Yong said. “We should wait until tomorrow to do this.”

His jaw clenched. The others noticed. Gods but this fucking exhaustion was going to be the death of him, it was like someone was painting his every thought on his sleeve.

“I have made arrangements that require precise timing,” Tristan said. “I’ve been given something for the pain, Yong, I will not slow us down.”

“Arrangements,” the Tianxi flatly repeated.

I cannot tell you, Tristan thought. You will betray me. Yong had told him as much when he had drawn his own lines in the sand. Another obstacle to dance around. It was tempting to say he would soon reveal the truth, but that was sentiment talking. Even that much might let Yong deduce that Vasanti was involved, decide that there was something worth selling there. And you’ll want to turn on me if you figure it out, like you did the infanzones.

So he gave nothing.

“Arrangements,” he simply said.

The older man’s face tightened with displeasure turning to the rest of the table for support. Tristan’s belly clenched, at least until Maryam shook her head.

“I would be more worried if he-” Francho broke into a cough, rasping out a breath before resuming. “If he wasn’t scheming something, Yong.”

The Tianxi’s lips thinned with displeasure, but he was alone in wanting to push the matter. And he did not have the leverage to force it, not when his only option should he walk away was trying the maze alone. It gave no pleasure to Tristan to watch the older man realize he was in a corner and there was little he could to about it.

“Sending soldiers out without telling them the marching orders is bound to get someone killed,” Yong bit out. “You’ll have to learn that lesson sooner or later, Tristan.”

Everyone was trying to teach him lessons, these days, the thief thought. It was getting rather tiring.

“I will not make empty promises,” Tristan said.

Little else was said, after that. His mind was elsewhere anyhow: now all that was left was to wait for Vasanti to open the dance.

—

Within ten minutes of the blackcloaks disappearing into the pillar there was a loud clicking sound, as if someone were working away at a giant lock.

In practice, that was exactly what Lieutenant Vasanti’s watchmen were doing. Most the garrison still in the Old Fort gathered in the courtyard before the iron gate, or on a wall they could see it them from, and the four of them joined the throng. The metal tiles on the gate began to turn one after another in sequence, likely matching the tiles getting activated inside the pillar, and the machinery around them began to move.

It pumped and turned and ticked, until there was a deafening hum and lights lit up along the outer ring of the gate. Small pinpricks of light, which began slowly rotating. Like golden fireflies they hovered, getting impressed murmurs out of the watchmen.

Tiles began spinning again, but slower. As if a combination was getting felt out instead of known by rote.

“Vanesa, gods rest her soul, was convinced that the tiles were a way to command some hidden aether machine in the gate,” Francho said. “It appears she was right.”

Tristan’s heart clenched. He made himself nod.

“Pretty lights,” Yong shrugged. “What are they for?”

Instead of the slow, lazy clockwise rotation the golden pinpricks were now going back and forth in both directions by haphazard stretches.

“They’re not lights,” Maryam quietly said. “They’re stars. It’s the same as the pattern above our heads.”

The thief blinked in surprise. He had grown so used to the golden light of the aether machine above he had forgot what that machine actually was: an orrery, a mobile representing the movement of the stars of firmament. It was why Vasanti had astronomical equipment out on her bastion.

“And how does that open the lock?” he asked.

“The stars aren’t in alignment above and on the gate,” Maryam said. “But look at what’s happening with the tiles – Vasanti is adjusting them closer.”

Vanesa had told him, Tristan suddenly recalled, that she could not figure out what the machinery on the gate did because it was not like a clock, did not use a fixed unit of measurement. His fingers reached for the watch in his pocket, clasping the bronze.  Because the movement of stars is more complex than that of a clock’s arrows, he thought. But we use it to tell time as well, do we not? Stars set our calendars, in olden days.

“It’s a time lock,” Tristan breathed out. “Back before the devils broke it and shut it down, it must have been set to open at fixed intervals.”

Maryam hummed.

“Days of the year, as measured by the movement of the stars,” she agreed. “A grand, beautiful, pointlessly complicated wonder. “

“Antediluvian work in a sentence,” Francho drily said, then coughed into his fist.

It took another half hour for the Watch crew to match above and below, but when they finally did the lights winked out and the entire courtyard went silent – as if every soul had breathed in at once. The machinery between the tiles and the outer ring began moving again, but the dominant sounds were pistons withdrawing, latches undoing. Like a vest getting unbuttoned, the iron gate split open in the middle and slowly began to open.

Only for a horrid grinding sound to explode out.

Something prevented the gates from opening more than a foot and change wide, soldered bars of steel that fought against the strength of the opening mechanism until wheels and cogs began popping off and metal bent. The sounds were deafening, and as he covered his ears Tristan saw tiles begin spinning again. Vasanti was intervening. The gates stopped opening, remaining stuck with just a foot of space to press through.

The cacophony stopped.

“The work of devils, do you think?” Yong quietly asked.

“Seems likely,” Francho said. “They were the ones who wanted this place sealed forever.”

If so, then their last measure had failed. Though the small space would prevent the watchmen from bringing something like artillery pieces inside, the blackcloaks themselves would pass just fine. Unless that was always the plan, Tristan thought. To make it so that only a small force can enter, small enough their starved god can devour them without trouble. Only madness could come out of guessing at the intentions of devils, he reminded himself.

“It will be soon, now,” Tristan said. “We need to get you out of sight before she returns.”

—

Lieutenant Vasanti came to gloat.

It surprised him. Not because he had thought it above the old woman, but because he would have bet on her caring more about exploring the insides of the pillar as she had wanted to for years over browbeating a rat. He had not been wrong, only slightly off: it seemed Vasanti had some time to spare before her watchmen were ready for the delving, so she had decided to spend it looking down on him.

“Not a sign of the god we wounded,” she said. “It must still be licking its wound.”

A shallow smile from the weathered Someshwari.

“Sometimes all it takes is a sharp lesson before they learn their place, don’t you agree?”

The grey-eyed thief did not smile insolently and retort with a quip, or remind her the only reason she could get anywhere was that he had traded the brand to her. Even as a boy he would have known better. Instead he stretched his arm discreetly so that he would not have the fake the wince of pain on his face and looked away like she had beaten him. He did not answer.

“Nothing to say?” Vasanti pressed. “Should I go and ask your little friends?”

That he could not allow. He’d asked them to get out of sight in the first place so that Vasanti and her followers could not see their group was gearing up for a go at the pillar. At the moment she would assuming he intended to follow in the wake of her own expedition, unaware he still had a key to the other entrance. If she caught on, though… Best to give her something to bite down on instead. Pride was the most affordable of offerings.

“I’m surprised you can spare the time on me,” Tristan said, making himself sound resentful. “Are you not about to lead your crew into the great unknown?”

“So I am,” Lieutenant Vasanti smiled. “And it will be the find of the century – an aetheric machine of that caliber, untouched for centuries yet still functional? There are nations out there that would go to war to acquire such a thing.”

He made himself wince again, as if pained by her victory instead of simply pained.

“But you are right,” Vasanti said. “I have no more time to waste on the likes of you.”

She paused.

“Save, perhaps to give you a warning,” the lieutenant said. “Do be careful when you follow us down, Tristan. Accidents happen so easily when exploring dangerous places.”

With one last pleased smiled she walked away, leaving him to consider her back with a cold gaze. Had he intended to follow in her wake, that would have worried him enough for the calculations on some risks to skew a different way. Vasanti was not the kind of woman to be merciful in victory, he thought. It had not been a mistake to count her an enemy. More interesting to him was that she intended to head down.

The quick look he’d had past the iron gates had revealed two sets of stairs, one curving upwards and the other down, and he’d assumed she would be aiming up. Not his trouble, he decided.

He waited out there until Vasanti took her eleven loyalists past the gate, disappearing below, then finally joined the others by the armory. All were armed to the teeth, even Francho who now bore a pistol – that he barely knew how to use, but could at least fire the right direction if it came to that. Yong and Maryam both carried bandoliers provided to them at Wen’s order, as had been bargained for: paper cartridges containing powder and salt munitions, musket balls filled with Glare-infused salt. The bane of gods.

Three pairs of eyes came to rest on him.

“I hope you are not awaiting a speech,” Tristan said. “Yong’s the only officer here.”

“I gave a few of the yearly addresses at Reve,” Francho volunteered, coughing into his fist. “Shall I try?”

The thief paused, knowing this was a waste of time but too curious to refuse.

“By all means,” Maryam said, settling the matter for him.

Yong rolled his eyes at them. Francho cleared his throat.

“My eager young students, I share with you today the most important lesson of my long career,” he said.

He straightened his back, wizened rheumy eyes sparkling with wisdom.

“Tenure is the only thing that matters,” Francho told them. “Once you have that you can do whatever you want: they can’t get rid of you without a two thirds majority of the Masters and that is like herding cats, if cats could feud for twenty years about the variable declensions of irregular verbs in Cantar.”

Maryam raised a hand as he began coughing.

“Yes,” Francho allowed after it passed.

“Do you have any lessons that apply to our coming venture in any way?” she politely asked.

Tristan bit the inside of his cheek so he would not laugh, Yong looked faintly embarrassed to have ever known them and Francho duly considered the question.

“Do not get eaten by monsters,” the old professor finally replied.

“An ideal we all aspire to,” Tristan gravely replied, lips twitching uncontrollably.

Yong walked away, muttering something under his breath about ‘canal water’ and ‘brain fever’. They had to hurry and catch up when it became clear that the Tianxi would not, in fact, be slowing down.

So began their bold venture into the unknown.

—

They did not need to watch for blackcloaks keeping watch, as there were none: within minutes of Vasanti and her loyalists disappearing Wen had summoned the entire garrison to him, as Tristan had figured he might. They had a clear path the rope ladder, then through the room where the folded metal ladder no one had ever got to work still lay inert. Tristan took the lead near the locked door leading to the tile room, silently gesturing for Fortuna to have a look ahead. The golden-eyed goddess huffed, but she had her look on the other side.

She popped her head, and only her head, through the door to signify there was no sign of Boria. As if he’d needed a headache on top of everything else.

The thief made a show of only slightly opening the door after he unlocked it with the stone button, ‘risking’ a glance and then venturing into the room. He called back it was clear after, the other three following with their weapons out. None of them had ever come here before, so their eyes wandered – mostly to the wall filled with glyph-inscribed tiles that Vasanti’s crew must have earlier used.

Tristan himself paid it little mind, instead heading for the door with the broken latch that had nearly got him killed. Yong followed closely behind, musket already at the ready and loaded with salt munitions.

“The lift is that way,” Tristan said. “Quietly now, the hall is where I ran into the god the first time.”

Into the hall they went, step by step, until they found the door of transparent green glass they’d come for.

“Fuck,” Yong reverently whispered. “It really is a lift.”

Through the glass they could see the ropes and pulleys – all of it metal, dull and pale – that would pull up the small stainless platform on the other side of the door. There were no obvious controls for it, but they might be hidden from where this side of the door. The handle was easy enough to find: a simple grip carved into the glass, allowing the thief to slide the door into the wall. Tristan tested the platform with his foot and found it solid, then stepped onto it. A swift look around found what he was looking for.

“There it is,” he said.

A vertical stripe of cryptoglyphs carved in the wall, besides which three circular symbols of gold had been set into the stone. Yong, who had leaned in, nodded and withdrew.

“Francho,” he said, gesturing for the professor.

They both left to give the old man the time and privacy to use his contract and learn how to work the lift. They walked a little further down, staying close to the walls and keeping an eye on both sides of the hall. Maryam was keeping guard by the door with the broken latch in case anyone form the Old Fort intended on following them in.

“I thought the god would be lying in wait for sure,” Yong admitted. “We are the easier target.”

Now was the time to tell him, following the plan, but the thief still hesitated. It did not go unnoticed.

“Tristan,” Yong slowly said, “what did you do?”

He had to tell Yong now, he knew. He would have to ask the crew to wait here, and they were not going to agree to that unless he gave them a good reason for it. It’s too late for you to sell me out now anyway, the thief thought. It wouldn’t do you any good. Vasanti is too far and the end of this trial so very close. It should tip the balance his way.

“It’s not here,” Tristan said, “because I told the god when Vasanti would go through the front gate.”

The Tianxi went still, as if he’d been slapped, but Tristan had no regrets. Even with Yong along, it was a near certainty they would die if they fought the god. Tristan had, therefore, ensured that Boria would be elsewhere.

“Wen will kill you,” Yong quietly said. “Slowly. He’ll hunt you to the ends of this island if he has to.”

The words were an afterthought, compared to the disappointed look in the man’s eyes. Like he had misjudged Tristan. The thief had known it was coming: Yong had left the infanzones when he believed they were using the leftovers as bait, during the Trial of Lines. Now Tristan had done even worse, not even leaving the matter to chance.

“Wen would have been an issue,” Tristan agreed. “So I lied to him, told him that the god cornered me and I had to bargain that information so it would let me leave. He is preparing to ambush the ambusher as we speak.”

Wen had been furious that Watch lives were put at risk, of course, but recognized that Vasanti and her men would likely have been attacked anyway. All Tristan had done was forewarn the god, and in compensation he had given Wen something the man wanted: a reason to relieve Lieutenant Vasanti from command. After the fat lieutenant drove off the god with a counter-ambush, he would be able to call Vasanti reckless and argue she was out of control. Risking Watch lives for her pride.

He would then be able to pull the entire garrison out of the Old Fort, getting them out of the line of fire before Tristan broke the golden aether machine and the gods of the maze were freed of the rules keeping them leashed to their shrines – and unable to hurt mortals outside of the tests. But the timing for all that would be delicate, which was why he was telling Yong this in the first place and would soon tell the others.

“You made a deal with Wen,” the veteran said.

“I did,” Tristan said. “And it involves waiting to take the lift until-”

Maryam leaned through the doorway.

“Shots,” she called out. “I can hear them echo from further down, through the wheel room where Tristan almost died. I think the Watch ran into the god.”

“That,” Tristan finished. “Waiting until that.”

In a matter of moments, he thought, Lieutenant Wen would rescue the other watchmen and drive away Boria.

“Francho,” he called out. “How are we doing?”

A long coughing fit was his first answer. The second was more promising.

“I need Sarai to make a Sign,” the old man said, “but I believe I have found our answer.”

He did not even need to gesture for Maryam to come running, she had been listening in. They all went to stand on the stainless platform, Francho muttering his instructions to the pale-skinned woman as she frowned at the golden inscriptions.

“There were a lot more shots sounding below than there should have been given how many people Vasanti took down with her,” Maryam casually said.

“A question I’ll answer as soon as you get the lift moving,” Tristan replied.

“Well,” she said, “if you insist.”

She traced her finger over the topmost symbol, teeth gritted as she did, and a faint streak of darkness glimmered wherever skin touched gold. Sher withdrew her hand the moment it was finished, like she’d been burned, and black smoke wafted off the gold.

From the tip of her finger as well, until she wiped it off on her tunic.

“Did it-” Yong began, mouth closing when the platform shuddered beneath their feet.

It began rising after, perfectly soundless and at what felt like a brisk trot. The stone around them was smooth and identical, however, so there was no telling at what speed they were truly moving.

“Answers,” Maryam prompted.

Tristan gave them, same as he had with Yong. What he’d told the god, what he’d told Wen. Neither seemed irked at his tactics – Francho, if anything, looked pleased. After that, at least he told the crew what it was that Wen had asked in exchange for the salt munitions.

“He wants us to break the aether machine,” Tristan said. “That way the Watch will be forced to attempt to kill the Red Maw instead of continuing the trials.”

From the corner of his eye he caught the first break in the stone walls. A green glass gate leading into a well-lit room, the glimpse barely a second long.

“That is madness,” Yong grunted. “The maze might be failing, but it is still the only thing keeping the Maw at bay. What if it spreads out of control?”

“It has had centuries and not spread more than a mile or two into the seabed,” Francho said. “Even if it consumes every speck of life on the Dominion, how far can it really go? It will simply be one of a hundred blockaded islands in the Trebian Sea.”

Another break, this time for another side, and Yong saw it too. They shared a look, both wondering whether it was a sign they were getting near the summit.

“You think the Watch will starve it out?” Maryam asked, sounding surprised.

“It would not be the first time they were forced to handle a god this way,” Francho shrugged. “My concern is that if we act too early the gods of the maze might attack the Old Fort while watchmen are still in it. That would earn us a shallow grave.”

“Wen is to lead them out,” Tristan reminded him.

“If he can convince the others to side with him against Vasanti,” Yong noted. “He’s right, that is not a sure thing.”

“Waiting too long would be dangerous,” the thief said. “Whatever made the god desperate to attack intruders will turn it against us when it realizes we are heading to the summit. We have some time, but we cannot afford to-”

Green glass exploded from behind him scattering against his coat, and all Tristan saw as he turned was a flash of red. His spine, it was going to hit his – the thief hit the floor, warm spraying all over his face, and there was a scream. A woman’s scream. Maryam had pushed him down, and the hand that’d done it was still on his hip.

Missing two fingers.

Boria’s tongue withdrew with a wet slurp before the lift’s rise could cut it off.

“Fuck,” Tristan said, “Maryam, I need to-”

“Move,” Yong shouted, firing his musket past them.

Tristan hit the deck as green glass burst again, the god letting out a scream of hatred as Yong’s salt shot hit flesh. He scrabbled on the ground through shards of glass until he had his bag in hand, ripping out bandages.

“Reloading,” the Tianxi calmly said. “Cover your wall.”

“Maryam, give me your hand,” Tristan hissed. “You’ll bleed out.”

“Fuck,” she cursed, and slammed the mutilated limb into his lap as she fumbled with her pistol.

She shot into glass a moment before it exploded, a massive hand clawing at the stainless floor and trying to rip out Francho – who threw himself to the side, screaming as the glass shards cut into his skin. Tristan forced Maryam’s hand up and tied a tourniquet on the fingers. She’d lost her little and ring finger down to the bottom phalange. To save his life.

How did someone even out a debt like that?

“Francho, aim your fucking pistol,” Yong snarled. “Now is not the time to fall apart.”

The old man was trembling so badly he could not hold the gun up, Tristan saw as he rose to his feet. He drew his own, helping up Maryam, and grit his teeth. The same stone walls that had seemed like a haven now seemed sinister, like the muzzle of a gun. There was no telling when Boria would strike, or from where. How is it even keeping up with us?

Glass burst behind them.

“VERMIN,” the god snarled.

Tristan shot, but it went wide and Francho slipped on the glass as he tried to flee Boria’s searching hands. The old man’s feet was caught and Tristan cursed as he threw his useless pistol at the god, to his complete surprise hitting it right in the eye – it yelped, releasing Francho, and as Yong landed a shot to drive it off Tristan dragged the old man back.

“My pistol,” the old professor panted. “Take my pistol, I can’t-”

The thief took it, not having the heart to admit he might be an even worse shot than the old man. At least he could hold it the right way. The four of them stood together, clustered and fearful, as the lift continued to rise. Five breaths passed, then ten, then twenty.

When thirty had passed, one of them spoke up.

“Tristan,” Yong said. “Did I go mad, or did I see you throw your pistol at it?”

“I was improvising,” he replied defensively.

Maryam’s forehead fell against his back, his friend laughing convulsively.

“How are you feeling?” Tristan asked her.

She snorted, voice still taut with laughter.

“Like a god ate two of my fingers,” she informed him.

“Going against the single piece of advice I gave you,” Francho noted.

A heartbeat passed, then they were all howling with laughter. It wasn’t even that funny. It was just a release of tension, though none of them dared to take an eye off their wall. As the last chuckles began to peter out, the platform between them shuddered again.

“It’s slowing down,” Tristan said, almost disbelieving. “Are we…”

“We must,” Yong said.

The older man did not even try to hide his relief.

“Tristan.”

His gaze swept around and he found the source of the whisper: Fortuna, standing in a corner. She gestured discreetly. He cocked an eyebrow.

“Tristan?” Francho asked.

“Not now,” he said, then lowered his voice. “What are you pointing at?”

Fortuna, again, moved her chin oddly. Up, he realized, She was pointing up as discreetly as she could. Ignoring the worried gaze from Francho, he flicked as tactful a glance up as he could. He could see the top of the lift, he realized. Where their rise would end. There was even a glass door. But why would Fortuna – a second door, this one open. Leading into a room without light, so he had thought it part of the stone wall at first glance.

He met Fortuna’s golden eyes, cocking an eyebrow. She nodded back.

He swallowed a curse, knowing that if he said anything Boria would hear it. Its hearing was sharp. Yong was looking at him as if he were mad, but the others had been told – or put together – that he was speaking with his god. Tristan put a finger to his lip, then gestured up at the dark doorway. It took three heartbeats to make himself understood with a pantomime that couldn’t easily be seen from above, and they were just about to end their trip the thief grit his teeth and shot into the dark.

Light flashed, revealing poisonous yellow eyes poised on them, and the god leapt down before the lift could dock into place.

He heard someone shouting – him, Yong? – and there was another shot, but the Boria was just too large and too heavy. It landed among them, Tristan getting slammed into the wall and hitting his head against stone. Dazed, he blinked as he heard shouting as Yong bared his sword. Francho shouted, choking on his cough, and Maryam was thrown right through the glass door by a flick of the god’s tail. His vision swam, eyes tearing up as all that came in focus was golden eyes. Fortuna, still facing him.

Holding a single golden coin in her hand.

“All in,” he croaked, and her laugh was the loveliest thing he’d ever head.

He saw the flash of gold go up, spinning, and the string in the back of his mind pull the furthest it ever had. The clock did not tick, this time. No, the debt was too large for that. It felt like the heartbeat of an ancient titan, right against his ear. Like thunder rolling out, and the string pulled so far back it came all the way around.

Fortune and misfortune in a single stroke: beneath their feet, the platform broke.

“No,” Boria screamed.

The god scrabbled against the wall, Tristan falling on its back. He clung to the slimy scales as the god struggled to drag itself through the doorway, but Yong had thrown himself through the broke glass door and Maryam was with him, dragging up Francho. The Tianxi aimed his musket down at the god, hesitating when his gaze dipped to Tristan.

“Do it,” he shouted.

His hands were already sliding against the scales. Yong grit his teeth and fired right into the god’s hand, breaking its grip. It dropped.

So did Tristan, until his back hit a ball of solid Gloam.

Scrabbling desperately not to fall off, the thief hugged the curves as the god toppled past him with beastly howls of rage.

“Hurry,” Maryam snarled, “a rope, I can’t-”

But they had no rope. Instead Francho leaned over the edge, legs held by Yong, and as the old man trembled Tristan leapt across the gap – his fingers sunk into the professor’s clothes, ripping the cloth, and he shouted in fear but the collar stuck and then both Yong and Maryam were dragging them up. Up, up, as Francho’s clothes continued to rip around the collar and just before it came right off Yong caught him by his and dragged him over the edge.

They fell in a pile, bleeding and bruised and panting so loud they almost couldn’t make out the howling of the god until it no longer made any noise at all.

—

The summit of the pillar was as single cavernous hall.

They stumbled forward hesitantly, awed by the size and troubled by how utterly empty it was. There was nothing within save for a wide ring of stone seats, all facing the center of the room, and a shallow pit in the middle that could not be more than five feet wide and as many deep.

“Is it the wrong place?” Yong asked, sounding exhausted to the bone.

“No,” Maryam said. “There is… something here. The aether is too thick.”

It was Francho who found the answer by virtue of being the first to touch one of the stone seats. Lights flared, coursing out of the pit like a river in reverse and expanding into a massive riot of colors and shapes. Tristan swallowed, blinking away the headache he was getting just looking at it.

“I’ll leave that to you,” he told the old man. “I’ll find us an exit.”

It was not all that difficult to achieve as much, now that the flared lights chased the shadows out of the room. There were two smooth opening in the stone. Tristan traded a look with Yong as Maryam joined Francho by the lights, the two of them splitting the work. The thief’s ended up a dead end: it was, he found out to his mild amusement, a latrine. An absurdly spacious one with basins to wash your hands in, but a latrine nonetheless. Apparently even the Antediluvians had felt certain needs. Yong turned out to be the lucky one.

“I think this leads out,” the Tianxi called out, having doubled back.

Tristan crossed the room to join him, ignoring the moving lights and excited talk from the other two. Francho, he noted, was moving near one of the stone seats again. He could only approve of using the old man’s contract as a shortcut. He found a long, dimly lit hall when he joined Yong. Going in a straight line, it seemed to go on for long enough that outside the mountain seemed the only possible destination.

“That’s our bet,” Tristan agreed.

“And there’s that,” Yong added, pointing to the side.

The thief squinted, making out what the man was pointing at after a moment. Another green glass door.

“Another lift?” he asked.

“We’ve only seen the green glass on those,” the Tianxi shrugged.

The veteran leaned back against the wall, reaching inside his bag and producing a small tin flask.

“Yong,” Tristan reproached. “Truly?”

“You sent men and women sworn to protect us right into the jaws of a god for a plan that did not even work,” Yong mildly replied. “Shut your fucking mouth, Tristan. I’ll drink if I feel like it.”

The thief rocked back, hurt but refusing to show it. That’d not been unearned, he knew. He’d been the one to first break trust. So instead of the sharp answer on the tip of his tongue, he walked away. There would be time to mend that bridge later, if they both lived through the night. He hoped.

Returning to the great hall, he paused in sheer surprise at what now stood before him.

What had been a largely empty hall was now filled with tall steles risen from the ground, more emerging or moving to the sides as Maryam tugged at ropes of silver light going into the mess of lights at the heart of the room. Which were not so messy anymore. Shapes had come into focus, outlining the island only separated in zones of different color connected by red furrows.

“Tristan,” Francho called out, then broke for a cough. “We figured it out.”

“Figured out what?” he warily asked.

“What the Antediluvians were doing here,” Maryam said. “Or something close to it.”

Francho beamed, rheumy eyes bright.

“The Red Maw transported raw aether,” the old professor said. “Centuries ago the island was divided into areas where certain plants and animals were installed-”

“It’s why so many lemures from different parts of the world can be found here,” Maryam cut in. “They drew on fauna and flora from all over-”

“And then the entity that became the Red Maw was to release the aether into those specific areas, presumably so that the Antediluvians could study the effects,” Francho cut right back. “Presumably there was another facility dedicated to study, but I believe this one was meant to control the Red Maw itself. Maryam, if you would?”

She tugged at the silver strings, steles rose and fell as the floor parted like water and the lights changed. A new image came into focus. It was, Tristan thought, a much finer version of the sight revealed by the small machine they’d got to work below. A see-through sight of the island from the side, only this one also outlined the pillar they stood in: it was a massive spear pointing downwards, with thin filaments spreading out near the top of the shaft all over the top of the mountain. One of them, Tristan noted, seemed to be the hallway Yong had found.

It led outside, he realized with excitement.

Then his gaze turned to the Red Maw and the excitement faded. The tip of the spear was right above a massive nest of red lines and a thick knot at the heart that had to be the god’s heart.

“See?” Francho said. “It cannot be a coincidence the facility reaches precisely there. I expect there is a way to force the Red Maw to begin feeding the areas aether again instead of hoarding it, perhaps using the same phenomenon that forced rules onto the maze. If we could only-”

The shot took him by complete and utter surprise.

He dropped to the floor, the other two scattering to take cover behind steles, but it had not been them that were shot out. Instead Tristan turned to find that Yong had dropped to the floor, and that walking right past him a bloodied silhouette advanced. Black cloak torn to strips and face bloodied, Lieutenant Vasanti raised a second pistol.

“Not a move, you little rat,” she snarled. “You, with the Signs – step away from the lights or the boy gets a new hole in the head.”

Tristan swallowed, reaching for the luck, but his fingers closed around nothing. He could feel anything, borrow anything. Manes, had he even seen Fortuna since he’d made the lift drop? He could not remember. Did I burn out my luck? He raised his hands, not daring move an inch under Vasanti’s steady gaze.

“Lieutenant,” Maryam said, “I do not know what angered you so, but there is no-”

“Shut up, girl,” Vasanti said. “You think I can’t see it? Wen coming right when he did, like he’d been forewarned. You planned it together, and I won’t get shot by that idiot in Three Pines while the smug asshole eats a fucking pastry.”

Tristan’s eyes flicked past the blackcloak, seeking Yong. Was he alive? He couldn’t tell from here, but the Tianxi was not moving. How had she even-

“You took a lift up,” the thief breathed up. “The other one.”

“I was right, like usual,” Vasanti laughed. “The closest way up was below, a maintenance room. I pressed on after the cowards left, proved my point. Beautiful work that lift, it didn’t make a sound – and the drunk was too busy drinking to hear me coming, anyway.”

The cheer went away.

“And I told you to fucking step away from the lights, girl,” the lieutenant said. “You don’t know what you’re meddling with. You think the devils left it all to a single god? There’s always another angle with Lucifer’s brood.”

From the corner of his eye, Tristan saw Francho hiding behind a stele and palming a knife. Discreetly he tried to shake his head, but the old man ignored him. Tristan urgently sought Maryam’s eyes and after a heartbeat met them.

Then Pandemonium broke loose.

Francho popped out from behind the stele, throwing his knife at Vasanti, who ducked out of the way and aimed right at Tristan. He threw himself to the side, cursing as he saw halfway through the movement he’d done it too early – her pistol was following him. Then Maryam ripped her hands off the lights after a curt gesture.

The lights shut down as Vasanti fired, light flashing and the bullet whizzing past him.

“Oh, you idiot girl,” the old Someshwari breathed out. “You shut down the whole thing, you’ll trigger–”

Though it was dark, Tristan could tell exactly what happened: every single stele blew up in the following heartbeat. Francho’s scream was snuffed out and the thief hit the floor again. The floor shivered, unseen rivers of aether filling it, and a second later dim lights filled the room again – so shallow he could barely make out shapes. Maryam lay prone on the ground, unmoving. He looked for Francho and did not find him, until he realized he had.

The bloody, burnt strands of flesh on the floor were all that remained of the man.

Swallowing, Tristan reached for his knife as his eyes sought Vasanti – but he found neither the blade nor the blackcloak. His blackjack, though still lay nestled against his side. He took it in hand. Was the lieutenant dead as well? Had she- his vision swam as he hit to the back of his head slammed him forward. He turned, striking blindly behind him, but Vasanti casually stepped out of the blow and struck him with the grip of her pistol again.

He rocked back, teeth chattering.

“Fucking kids,” the lieutenant said. “I warned her the devils would have the damn thing trapped in case someone meddled with their work. The entire machine might be wrecked now.”

Tristan rosed to his feet, feeling faint, and brought up his blackjack. Vasanti snorted.

“I was killing men when you were in swaddling clothes, boy,” the old woman said. “I would have dropped you at your best – now I’ll get to make it slow.”

There was a sudden flare of light, something emerging from the pit behind them, and in that heartbeat Tristan moved. It took her by surprise: she fell for the feint, protecting her face as he landed a blow on her wrist and forced her to drop the pistol. She jabbed forward and he drew back, but then she did something strange with her footing – drawing forward and back, almost oscillating – and when he feinted she landed a blow against his jaw.

He spat blood, swinging at her temple, but she caught his wrist and flipped him. His back hit the ground and she struck him in the gut, sitting on his stomach as he desperately protected his face from another blow. She broke his guard and hit him again, baring bloody teeth.

“I told you,” Vasanti snarled, “that I would make it-”

The blade went through her throat. It was ripped out with a flick of the wrist, the old woman reaching for the open wound with something like surprise on her face. She was kicked to the side and fell, convulsing.

Three heartbeats later she was dead.

“You missed the spine,” Yong rasped out, standing over her cooling corpse. “And what do you know – rotgut makes for a very good painkiller.”

The Tianxi offered him a hand up and Tristan took it, the other man groaning at the effort.

“We need to get out of here,” the thief said. “I’ll take Maryam.”

“Francho?” Yong asked.

The thief shook his head. The ground shuddered beneath their feet again.

“Hurry,” the other man said. “I don’t like the way the floor keeps shaking.”

Maryam was unconscious and heavier than he would have thought, but her draped her across his back. It was only when trying to catch up to Yong that Tristan thought to look at the burst of light that’d almost let him turn things around on Vasanti. The shape were bare bones, all in pale yellow, but there was no mistaking what he was looking at. It was the pillar he was standing in, the spear pointed at the heart of the Red Maw. Everything keeping it bound to the peak of the hollow mountain was collapsing, as if sabotaged.

Vasanti had been right. The devils had left one last trap. If mortals dared to meddle with their seal, well, the structure maintain it was to have one last purpose: it was to be turned into a gargantuan spear to be sunk right into the Red Maw’s heart in the hopes of killing it. And if that weren’t enough, well, then the god would be buried under an entire mountain. That ought to slow it down some, surely.

“Fuck,” Tristan Abrascal swore, and began running.

# Chapter 38

The cliffside path was narrow but dry, which was the only reason they lived.

They ran down into the yawning dark, the trembling light of Zenzele’s lantern revealing a thin stripe of the grounds ahead as they tried to outrun the tide of falling stone. When the path abruptly turned to the right, tucked into the mountainside, the Malani noble almost toppled off the edge – Cozme yanked him back, almost falling off himself when Ferranda ran into his back. If the stone path had been even slightly slippery all three would have tumbled into the void.

“Careful,” Angharad shouted, dragging the infanzona back by the collar. “We need to-”

Dust exploded a dozen feet above them in a tall plume, rocks going flying. The eleven of them had clustered at the corner, forced together by momentum, and it took a moment to extricate themselves. Tupoc pushed to the fore, ripping Zenzele’s lantern out of his hands, and deftly led the way down. Angharad flicked a glance back as the others began moving again, picking up speed on the narrow path, and grimaced as she saw that Shalini was still carrying Ishaan’s corpse on her back.

The Pereduri did not bother to suggest she should put it down: the look on the other woman’s face was not one to be argued with.

“Come on,” she said instead. “The landslide is catching up.”

They set out down the cliffside again. The same turn that had near kill them was likely the only reason they lived, Angharad realized as she heard a rolling thunder in the distance and a tide of death rushed past the path they had been running down not minutes ago. Most of the landslide was facing the slope where the sanctuary had been waiting, and they’d just given it the slip. Not that they were out of danger: most was not all.

The first rock was the size of a fist, and it bounced off Yaretzi’s shoulder as she let out a grunt of pain. Angharad glimpsed ahead, feeling her blood run hot – she had used a vision earlier, there was only so much more she could borrow of the Fisher’s power before it killed her – and moved before the glimpse was even finished. She seized Song by the shoulder and pressed the two of them against the mountainside just before a boulder the size of a horse tumbled right past them.

A heartbeat later and all that would have been left of Song was red paste and screaming.

“Ahead,” Tupoc shouted, voice without a hint of mockery for once. “I see shelter.”

He spoke true, for the cliffside path there ate into the mountain as a short tunnel – the peak’s slope served as a wall and ceiling, and under that cover they huddled together as death rumbled above. They waited, pressed tight under the shelter as stone and dust spilled past them in spurts. How long they waited without speaking a word Angharad could not be sure. Eventually, though, the last of the falling ended and their breaths began to ring loudly in the silence that followed.

“I think that was the worst of it,” Lord Zenzele finally said. “My lantern, Xical.”

“Try not to walk it off another cliff,” Tupoc helpfully advised. “It makes it harder for the rest of us to see.”

“Enough,” Angharad tiredly said. “Peril has not passed; another landslide could begin at any moment.”

“And parts of the path down could now be blocked with stone,” Song grimly said. “Let us not be caught with our trousers down.”

Zenzele Duma snatched his lantern back a little more strongly than was warranted, but they all pretended not to see. His hatred of Tupoc was entirely deserved. Their company began heading down again, far from slowly but short of the reckless pace from earlier. As Song had predicted, the spill had touched the path. Small chunks, mostly, and piled of dust. They stepped carefully around sharpened shards, the trouble coming when they found a rock taller and broader than a man balancing precariously in the middle of the path.

“It’s too narrow a space to squeeze through,” Lan said.

“Agreed,” Song replied.

Angharad did not argue. Instead she turned to Tupoc, drawing the Izcalli’s eyes.

“Assemble your spear,” she said. “We’ll push it off the edge together.”

The man’s pale eyes assessed the stone.

“Could work,” he agreed.

It was more difficult than it sounded, largely because the path was narrow and they were many – the others had to withdraw so the pair would have enough room to push. Angharad’s hands were slick with sweat and twice her grip slipped against the cool metal, but they bent their knees and pushed until the stone slowly began to tip forward. Gravity did the rest of the work.

“Nothing like a spot of exercise with death hanging over your head,” Tupoc cheerfully said afterwards.

Angharad ignored him, brushing past his shoulder. She held no lantern, but Zenzele helpfully passed his and she took the vanguard for the rest of the way down. There were more small stones the further down they got, but no more large ones. It had been stark odds for one to land across the path as it had in the first place. Half an hour of brisk descent led them at the bottom of the mountain, the tall silhouette of it looming in the distance as thick woods spread out before them.

She waited at the tree line with the lantern in hand until the others caught up, spilling down the path one after another. Shalini, Angharad saw, was last by a wide margin. Ishaan’s corpse was heavy and she had slowed down with exhaustion from carrying it.

“The landslide didn’t reach this far,” Lan observed, one of the last to catch up. “I’d say this is as safe as we’re going to get outside a sanctuary.”

“Agreed,” Lady Ferranda said. “This is where we make our plan, if we are to stick together.”

“Is there a plan to make?” Tupoc shrugged. “There will be no rest. We take the Trial of Weeds, or we die in the dark. It is a simple thing.”

He sounded almost pleased, further proof the man was half mad and half jackal. Worse, Angharad was not convinced he was wrong.

“I have no intention of joining the Watch,” Isabel sharply cut in. “The blackcloaks must recognize that a natural disaster undid their trials and prevented us from seeking the promised sanctuary. Surely there is a way to reach the garrison.”

“You could climb back up and start digging out the fort,” Song drily replied. “By all means have at it, Ruesta.”

Cozme snorted. It had not escaped Angharad’s attention that since Augusto’s demise the mustachioed man had taken open pleasure in any backtalk directed at the infanzona.

“Helpful as always, Song,” Isabel bit back. “Do you think I am alone in not wanting to take the third trial? Lady Ferranda-”

“Can speak for herself,” the other infanzona said.

Ferranda’s plain, lean face was smudged with dust and her bun had spit out strands of hair but her eyes were sharp and she stood straight. Isabel, still red in the face with sweaty locks pressed against her forehead, was not faring so well. The two noblewomen matched gazes.

“So speak,” Isabel said, sounding confident. “Should we not find the Watch, Lady Villazur? Your family will be awaiting your return, as mine does.”

The other woman’s jaw clenched. Ferranda did not answer for a long time, looking for all the world like a woman standing on the edge of a precipice.

“I am thinking,” she finally said, “of taking the third trial.”

Surprise rippled through half of them, Angharad not the least. Had Ferranda not come to the island to gild her family’s name? And win the right to keep a lover, she recalled. Now that Sanale had passed, it seemed that Ferranda Villazur was not eager to return to her house without him. The dark-skinned noble kept her disapproval off her face. To serve your house only on your own terms was not true service, but it was not her place to comment.

“I will be doing the same,” Cozme Aflor casually added, rolling his shoulder with a wince. “It seems to me that I am in a need of a change of careers.”

Angharad cocked an eyebrow and Tupoc let out a small, nasty laugh. Brun looked amused as well, though as was his wont he kept quiet.

“You’ve run out of Cerdans to lose, so I suppose you might as well,” Tupoc grinned.

Cozme’s eyes on him were cold, the same way they had been when he pulled a knife on the champion of the vermin god. What kind of a man had he been, before House Cerdan took him in? Not the kind to take insults lying down when he had no master to protect, Angharad thought, so she cleared her throat to command attention before matters could get out of hand.

“Is there any among us who does not desire to take the Trial of Weeds?” she asked. “Save for Lady Isabel, I mean.”

There was no answer and she realized a heratbeat too late that she had blundered. Even if there were such individuals, they would hesitate when being put on the spot like this – it was clear that most of their group wanted to press forward, and who would want to be left alone in the woods? She cleared her throat again, faintly embarrassed at the misstep.

“It seems to me,” she tried, “that there will be a Watch garrison at the northern tip of the island, the port town called Three Pines. I imagine that given the circumstances the Watch would not press into service those who reach that safety.”

Isabel smiled at her, pretty in her visible relief.

“That seems a compromise all can live with,” she said.

“It’s a pretty plan,” Shalini broke in, Ishaan’s corpse yet on her back, “but you’re forgetting something. When that mountainside fort got buried, we lost more than a sanctuary: we lost the watchmen that would tell us what the Trial of Weeds actually is.”

There was a moment of damning silence as the truth of her words sunk in. That was, admittedly, something of a hindrance. Song was the one to end the paralysis, reaching for her bag and dragging a scroll out.

“We cannot know the details,” the Tianxi acknowledged, “but neither are we entirely in the dark. Here, come closer.”

Her map, Angharad realized. Song unfolded it in the light of the lantern, everyone crowding around the paper.

“We should be somewhere around here,” Song said.

Her finger was resting on a small, marked place on the northern side of the mountains splitting the island – the very same they had crossed by beating the maze. And not far from where they were, Angahrad saw a slender grey line going through the woods that made up most of the northern third of the Dominion of Lost Things.

“A road?” she asked.

“I do not know for sure,” Song replied, “but I believe so. More importantly, it goes through here.”

Her finger followed along the grey line until it reached a drawing in the midst of the woods that looked like a small fortress.

“Is that a Watch outpost?” Zenzele frowned.

It might be, Angharad thought. The road went through it and continued all the way to the norther tip of the island, to Three Pines.

“I don’t know,” the silver-eyed sharpshooter admitted. “But it is something, and even if it is empty we can use the grounds to rest with some safety.”

“We won’t make it there tonight,” Ferranda said.

“Not unless we march through the night,” Tupoc agreed. “I do not hate the notion, but I’ve no doubt there will be whining.”

He snuck a look at Shalini, who glared back.

“We should at least push forward for another hour,” Angharad said. “I do not know if there are cultists on this side of the island, but if there are then the commotion of the landslide is sure to have drawn them out.”

She flicked a glance at Tupoc, who shrugged.

“I only dealt with the one war party and its bishop,” the Izcalli said. “I gathered from them the island has rival tribes, but not where they might dwell.”

“Hollows are one thing,” Lan easily said, “but there will be lemures in the woods and a bunch of us are bleeding.”

“Then we keep going until we find defensible shelter,” Angharad suggested. “We’ll keep a watch through the night.”

Nods all around. She would have preferred to press on to the possible outpost, but it was true that might take hours yet and much of their party was either wounded, exhausted or both.

“That will be most interesting,” Tupoc noted.

She frowned at him, reluctant to indulge him and ask. He answered anyway.

“Have you forgotten,” the Izcalli said, “that the murderer is still among us? I do wonder if we’ll be waking up to another corpse.”

The mood had been turning hopeful but that reminder skewered it thoroughly, which only amused the man all the more. It was with that dark truth hanging over them that they headed into the woods, taste for conversation snuffed out like an errant candle. Now every leaf shivering in the wind loomed like a hungry lupine and every time one of them came to close to another backs tensed for fear of a knife. Dangers within and dangers without, Angharad thought.

She was not sure which she should be wariest about.

—

Within fifteen minutes of starting, Angharad was quite done with traipsing through the woods.

Back home the rest of the kingdom often spoke of Peredur as a pristine land spared the scars of industry, unmarred by blast furnaces and smelt mills. Izinduna visited the High Isle for hunting trips and private retreats. That talk was about the heartlands of the duchy, however, the old Brenhinoedd – the ‘Kingsland’. Her own Llanw Hall was of the coast, and the rocky shorelands were simply unsuited to such sport. Like most seaside nobles, the closest Mother had ever come to chasing a stag was shipping venison sausages south to Port Cadwyn.

Her fatherhad been skilled hunter, as was fashionable in high society, but regrettably Angharad had never taken him up on his offers to learn the pursuit. Perhaps if she had she might have developed a fondness for the woods instead of a rising, deep-seated hatred. She was getting tired of walking about tripping on roots and getting whipped in the face by branches when Tupoc – reliable in his bastardry – waited until the last moment to release them. After getting smacked most indecorously in the breast by a branch, Angharad surrendered her place to Ferranda lest she be tempted to run the Izcalli through. Why, he would gasp out. Why, Tredegar? And she would look him in the eyes and say: my tit, you utter animal, you branch-whipped my tit.

Deciding that vivid fantasies of murder were perhaps a sign that her patience might be running out, Angharad drew back by slowing her steps and let Ferranda pass her by. Cozme too, as she did not care to keep the man company. That left her by Lord Zenzele, who did not much talk and often glanced back worriedly at Shalini. She was still trailing at their back, though Brun was making it a point to slow his steps so she would always have someone in sight. A good man, Brun.

It both helped and hurt when they reached the road Song had shown them on the map, a small path of beaten earth that was in disrepair but still usable. It was easier for Shalini to walk on the road, but their overall pace quickened as well. By the time the turn of the hour neared, the gunslinger looked fit to drop and Angharad was sharing the worried looks with Zenzele.

“I do not know anything of Ramayan funeral customs,” she said in a whisper. “Would she be offended if I offered help?”

“She’s Someshwari, Tredegar,” Zenzele grunted back. “They get offended at each other’s accents.”

Which was true, if somewhat impolite to speak out loud. It was an old jest in Malan that while all Someshwari agreed they were an empire no two had ever agreed on who should rule it.

“She cannot take much more of this,” Angharad said. “See how her legs are shaking.”

“We could make a stretcher with sticks and blankets,” Zenzele suggested. “We would not be saying anything, it simply happens to be impossible to use one of those alone.”

She side-eyed him.

“Hold up only the front and drag the back on the ground after tying the body up,” she countered.

The man looked faintly embarrassed, as well he should. It had been a shallow lie, a lie of ignorance or lack of forethought, and so not the same as willful mistruth. Yet even shallow lies were enough to tarnish one’s honor if regularly indulged in.

“To use one of those alone and well,” he corrected.

True enough. Angharad nodded her approval.

“I can surrender my bedroll to the work,” she offered, “but we will need-”

“Halt,” the call came from ahead.

Song’s voice. After one last look at Shalini the Pereduri moved to the front of the column, where the others were assembling. Song, raising her own lantern, had stopped by the side of the road and was casting light on a path to a small clearing. That would not have been worth a rest, had the edge of the clearing not been touched by a small hill from which rose a ruined tower revealed by cold starlight. A thick, stout octagon of stone that jutted upwards, its roof long gone and broad stairs leading to the yawning door halfway up its heights. A few good swords could hold stairs like that for an hour, Angharad thought.

“A most suitable place to camp,” the noblewoman said. “It is a fine find, Song.”

“I have an eye for those things,” the Tianxi replied with the faintest hint of irony.

Some chuckling. It had been an open secret before that Song’s contract had to do with her silver eyes, but the way she had seen through illusions in the temple-fortress and later when helping Ferranda on the Toll Road had made it into open knowledge. In a way, Angharad thought, that was the finest safeguard to what the Tianxi’s contract could truly do. Why wonder if she could see contracts, when she could already see through illusions and past the veil of darkness?

“My thanks for your efforts, Mistress Ren,” Cozme Aflor said, affecting gallantry. “Shall we get to it? I expect we could all use the rest.”

Angharad might have disliked the man, but she would not argue with the truth.

—

Everyone pitched in their supplies without argument, which was a pleasant change from the Trial of Lines.

By the looks of it they had enough for two meals, including the one they were about to have. None of them had bothered to bring much food, as the expectation had been that the sanctuary on the other side of the maze would provide them with fresh supplies. Water should last longer than that, at least through the day tomorrow, and they would keep an eye out for streams in the forest.

Though it was a risk, they decided on having a fire: it was the surest way to keep away animals. The inside of the tower was dry and spacious enough that everyone would be able to fit around the flame, keeping them warm through the night, and they could use a warm meal after their trials of the day. Besides, several of them needed to rinse wounds and Angharad might be no physician but she knew in the absence of alcohol boiled water was the best  substitute.

As tasks were settled on with rough efficiency, the Pereduri noblewoman volunteered to gather firewood. She knew the basics of woodcraft but little more than that, and was willing to leave such affairs in the hands of those more fitted to it. It was not demeaning work, even though Tupoc tried to imply as much with his smirk. Had she not been taught that the best blade should go the best hand? She was not so arrogant as to think that her hand would always be the finest.

Still, the man was irritating enough she walked out before hearing who else would take up the chore. It was a short walk down the stairs, which were set into the side of the hill, and from there to the clearing. The forest was dry and there was plenty to pick up from the ground, so Angharad rolled up her sleeves and got to work. It was a few minutes later, while adding to the respectable pile at the bottom of the stairs, that she got company. Turning as she heard footsteps, Angharad caught sight of a silhouette framed in moonlight.

In that ghostly glow Isabel Ruesta’s elegant curls and green eyes seemed almost unearthly, a spirit’s impossible beauty. And Isabel was very much a beauty, even visibly exhausted and on the verge of tears. The Pereduri straightened at the sight of her.

“What happened?” she asked.

Isabel shook her head, padding down the last of the stairs.

“It is nothing,” she said. “I came to help you, not-”

“Tears are not nothing,” Angharad gently said.

She laid a comforting hand on the infanzona’s arm. Isabel hesitated.

“Ferranda is being quite odious,” Isabel finally admitted. “And Cozme is all too happy to pile on.”

“There are limits to the allowances given by grief,” the noblewoman frowned. “Ferranda should mind her manners.”

“Who would make her?” Isabel wetly chuckled. “No one remains who cares for me in the slightest, Angharad. Kind Recardo never even reached the island, and my maids…”

She shivered, silver-touched tears trickling down her cheeks. Angharad pulled her close, Isabel fighting for half a heartbeat before sobbing against the Pereduri’s chest.

“They were as family to me,” the dark-haired beauty murmured. “I’ve known them since I was but a girl. Beatris looked so much like me back when we were children that we might as well have been twins, and Briceida… Gods, Briceida only came to the island so that I would be able to help her marry her sweetheart.”

Another sob as Angharad rubbed her back.

“And now she is dead.”

“It will be all right,” she soothed.

“No, it won’t,” Isabel muttered. “They despise me in there, Angharad, and after I tell them of my contract they will surely argue I must be cast out and-”

The reminder that the infanzona in her arms was not simply a pretty girl was like being drenched in cold water. Angharad half pulled away, breathing in sharply. Are my thoughts my own? Emotions, Isabel had told her, made her use her contract against her well.

“Isabel,” she slowly said, “are you…”

Green eyes watered as Isabel shook her head.

“I am fighting it down,” the infanzona swore. “It is hard, but I am controlling it.”

A moment passed as Angharad searched herself, finding that she was still wary even after that assurance. That was, ironically, how she came to decide that Isabel was telling the truth. Were she under the contract’s influence she would not have such doubts. She slowly eased back into the embrace, Isabel’s head coming to rest on her shoulder. Ignoring that warmth, Angharad laid out the bounds of honor in her mind. It was, she found, a tricky affair.

“Our pact was that you would reveal your contract when we reached the next sanctuary,” the Pereduri finally said. “It is to your honor that you would hold up your end of the bargain regardless, but you need not speak until we reach that.”

It might well be that Isabel was right and she would be cast out if she revealed her contract. This was not Angharad’s crew, her word was not law among the band of survivors. She would not force the infanzona into almost certain death against the letter of the bargain they had struck simply because the way to sanctuary would take longer than expected. She would still keep to the other part of the pact, revealing anything should she suspect Isabel of using her contract on another. If she were, Angharad thought, she would not have been driven out of the tower in tears.

“I do not want to break trust between us again,” Isabel whispered.

She had raised her head, so instead of mumbling against Angharad’s shirt her breath was a warm whisper against the Pereduri’s neck. She looked down, Isabel meeting her eyes. The faint redness left behind by the tears only turned more vivid the shade of the infanzona’s eyes, and before she knew could think twice she was leaning forward. Isabel’s lips were warm against hers and she fell into Angharad’s arms like she’d always been meant to be there. The kiss lit up a greed inside her belly and soon Angharad was pulling her closer, hand on her waist as – Isabel pulled away, breath labored.

“I am,” she began, then hesitated. “My control may slip, if we go continue.”

Angharad almost laughed. As if desire was not already setting her hands to roving, to pulling down those silken trousers and stealing moans from Isabel’s swollen lips. The contract could ask nothing of her that she was not already demanding.

“Let it,” she replied, and pressed Isabel back until the infanzona was up against a tree.

Pinning her against it she leaned forward, nipping at Isabel’s neck, and her fingers began to gently trail up her legs until – the sound of a throat getting cleared stilled her, ice creeping down her spine. She turned to find Song standing on the stairs, her silver gaze wintry. She pulled away, forcing herself not to make it hasty as if she were a child caught stealing from the pantry.

“Song,” she said, clearing her throat. “I had not thought you would-”

“Neither had I,” Song sharply replied. “An evening for disappointment, it seems.”

Isabel smoothed down her doublet, looking remorseful.

“She was only comforting me,” the infanzona said. “Please do not-”

“You strike me as sufficiently comforted, Ruesta,” the Tianxi said. “It might be best you finish gathering firewood on your own, while Angharad brings up her half of the work.”

Angharad’s lips thinned. She did not enjoy being talked down to as if a fool, but she was not unaware that in a sense she had broken her word to Song – she had promised the other woman she would not talk with Isabel alone, and though she had not sought out the conversation she had allowed it to happen. Encouraged it, even. Much as she would have preferred to defiantly lead Isabel into the woods instead of saying nothing, it would have been a black mark on her honor.

“What we discussed stands,” she told Isabel instead. “But Song may well be right in the other regard.”

Isabel looked away, seemingly insulted and not without reason. It had not been gallant of Angharad to begin something before disavowing it, even though honor demanded as much. It was with the distinct feeling that she was slinking away that Angharad began picking up her pile of firewood, bringing it up in the tower. She passed by Song’s cold gaze, which remained on Isabel, and by the second journey the infanzona had gone into the forest to gather more wood. Song said not a word, and Angharad did not feel up to assaulting that frosty silence.

The discomfort followed her inside when she was done. Shalini was sitting between Ferranda and Sanale, the three of them pulled close as the pair tried to draw smiles out of her, while in the opposite corner Brun and Yaretzi chatted quietly. Angharad might have sat this way with Song, if not for what had happened outside. Or she might have sat with Isabel, if not for the same. Her lack of restraint had cost her twice over.

For a heartbeat she felt like sitting with Yaretzi and Brun anyway, to try to steal back some sliver of comradery, but then the thought soured in her mouth: Yaretzi, she had heard, might not be called Yaretzi at all. According to Isabel she was much shorter than the Watch had been told, perhaps some sort of impostor. Throwing away the thought, Angharad instead sought out her bedroll. If she could not have company, she could at least have rest.

It was adding insult to injury to realize that Tupoc had apparently thought the same, and she fell asleep sulking.

—

Angharad was entirely awake by the sound of the third shot.

Scrabbling for her sword, pleased beyond words that she had slept with her boots on, the Pereduri ripped it clear of the scabbard just as a lantern exploded into bright flames. Lan fell to the ground with a shout, patting away at her clothes, and Angharad ducked behind the wall as another shot tore through the doorway. Cozme stood on the other side, pistol in hand, and nodded at her while the rest of the group scrambled. He must have been the one on watch when the enemies – hollows, she assumed – attacked.

“I’ve counted at least five muskets,” the mustachioed man said. “They hit the lanterns first, but they haven’t tried to come any closer.”

Angharad frowned. That seemed odd, given how the cult of the Red Eye was obsessed with taking prisoners to sacrifice.

“Did you see how many there were?” she asked.

He shook his head.

“They stayed in the dark,” Cozme said. “No lights.”

Behind them Song ordered those with muskets to flank the doorway and the rest to gather their packs in case there was a need to run, getting a rush of gratitude out of Angharad for her intervention. The glance she spared behind her revealed a looming trouble after she’d made sure that Lan was no longer aflame: with the fire still burning they were not out of light, but of the three lanterns they’d had left only one had been spared a bullet. Zenzele’s, she saw, which was bad luck. It had the least oil left in it.

The man in question joined Cozme on the other side of the door, while Ferranda pressed herself behind Angharad.

“Are they approaching?” the infanzona asked in a whisper.

Cozme risked a glance through the opening, then hastily withdrew and shook his head.

“Nothing,” he said. “They might be-”

(Angharad ran down the stairs as fast as she could, shots lighting up the woods – one, two, three, six – and reached the clearing before the first howls sounded, hounds charging out of)

She breathed out shallowly, ignoring the rest of what Cozme had been saying. The cultists had brought war hounds, that was why they had not yet tried the doorway. The Malani had used such tactics in olden times, back when swords and shield walls were the lay of Vesper – hounds unleashed before the charge to scare and scatter the enemy’s ranks. Should she warn the others? She could think of no way to do so without revealing her contract.

“Angharad.”

Song, standing in cover behind her while the others finished packing up the last of everyone’s affairs – Brun and Isabel went about it briskly, but Lan was using the opportunity to have a look at everyone’s packs – handed her the coat she had left behind as well as her sword belt and scabbard. Angharad nodded her thanks, shrugging on the coat as Ferranda took her place by the doorway.

A month ago she would have cared little for that coat, for it was not a gift from her family in a sense greater than Mother’s coin having paid for it, but after having been cut and shot in it so many times she’d grown passingly fond of it. More importantly, she thought as she adjusted her sword belt, this was an opportunity.

She’d passed her blade to Song to have both hands free for the belt, and when claiming her saber back she leaned close.

“They have hounds,” she whispered. “I counted six guns.”

Song nodded subtly and nothing more need said. The Tianxi squeezed past Ferranda to take a long look out, only ducking back in when a cultists out in the woods fired. The sound and billowing smoke had them all ducking back into cover, Song clearing her throat afterwards.

“I counted twelve,” she said. “Half with muskets, half with leashed hounds.”

Curses abounded.

“Twelve is not so many, even with dogs,” Zenzele opined. “We can break them.”

“Are you volunteering to be first down the stairs, my lord?” Brun drily asked.

The Malani hesitated.

“I will go,” Angharad cut in. “But we must first decide on whether we fight or run. This all smells to me of a trap: if they have hounds, why have they not yet released them to dig us out?”

“They must be scouts,” Ferranda grunted in approval. “Lady Angharad is right, they might well be pinning us in here until the rest of the warband arrives and they can storm the tower.”

Several agreed with her, after a thought, and the conviviality of it was what told Angharad something was wrong. No one had been taunted or implied to be a coward, so what was… She found Tupoc standing very still with his back to the wall, pales eyes unblinking as they stared right in front of him with a strange expression on his face. Angharad thought him touched by a contract, for a heartbeat, until she realized he was paralyzed not by a contract but something altogether simple. Fear. That strange expression, it was fear.

Most absurd of all was when she saw what had finally given pause to Tupoc Xical: hanging on a string coming from the tower’s broken ceiling, a small spider was in front of him. It rose an inch and the unflappable Izcalli flinched, trying to press closer to the wall. Angharad felt an incredulous laugh bubble up her throat at the thought of a man who constantly courted death near shaking in his boots before a spider smaller than her thumb, but then she thought again. Was this simple fear, she wondered, or something more?

Spirits gave boons, but they also claimed prices.

Regardless, she still had a use for Tupoc Xical. Angharad deftly reached out, catching the spider in her hand and crushing it. The Izcalli’s shoulders immediately loosened, but there was a new kind of wariness in his eyes when he met Angharad’s. Oh yes, she thought. Definitely a price.

She looked away first, but it did not feel like a defeat in the slightest.

“- bait the shots, then those of us with muskets fire a volley into the hounds,” Song was saying. “We make for the road after, head north to the outpost as fast as we can.”

“Is Lady Angharad truly willing to charge in alone?” Brun asked. “I have not heard this from her.”

“I am,” she said, stepping in. “Though once the cultists have wasted their shots on me, I expect I will be joined by others in the melee.”

“I will be right behind her,” Tupoc easily said. “Worry not your pretty head, Sacromontan.”

The fair-haired man looked like he wanted to roll his eyes, but said nothing.

“If we are in agreement,” Song said, “then we should take all our packs and ready for the fight. There is no telling how long we have before the rest of the cultists arrive.”

None argued against that. Song, she thought, had a knack for clear thought in such matters. A captain’s qualities, though she hid too much of her thoughts to easily earn trust from others. Angharad went back for her affairs only for Lan to kindly offer to carry them for her, as Angharad would be running. She accepted the other woman’s offer gracefully, finding herself at loose ends while the others moved about. The other who had finished early was Yaretzi, the Izcalli already having had her pack at the ready.

The two of them stood in silence, until something occurred to Angharad.

“I have a question about Izcalli spirits, if you would allow it,” she quietly said.

Yaretzi cocked an eyebrow.

“I only know so much, but by all means,” she replied.

“Is there one,” she said, “with a strong ties to spiders?”

The Izcalli, whose name might not be Yaretzi at all, cocked an eyebrow and threw a speculative look at Tupoc. Angharad grimaced. Perhaps that had not been as subtle a question as she thought.

“Many small gods,” Yaretzi said, “but among the great I can only think of the Grave-Given. His favored messengers are creatures of the dark: bats, owls and spiders.”

“And what does this Grave-Given trade in?” Angharad asked.

“Death and order,” she replied. “His judgement shapes where the Circle Perpetual will send a soul to be born again.”

Just another spirit playing tricks, the Pereduri mentally dismissed. The Circle was the work of the Sleeping God, far beyond what mere spirits would be able to influence. Still, it was said that some entities on the continent could meddle in the matters of death, the moments before a soul returned to the Circle. Perhaps this Grave-Given was one. Though what such a spirit would want with the likes of Tupoc, she thought, I cannot imagine.

Yaretzi looked like she wanted to speak more of it, but Angharad was saved the need of evasion by the last preparations coming to an end.

“Form up,” Song called out. “We are finished.”

Angharad nodded a farewell at a rueful Yaretzi, resting her hand on her blade, and went for the doorway. Tupoc waited on the other side of the gap, ready to follow in her wake. Song, musket loaded and at the ready, sought her out.

“Ready?” the Tianxi asked.

She nodded.

“You?” she asked.

Song nodded back.

“Then,” Angharad said, “let us not waste any more time.”

Breathing in, she unsheathed her sword and ran out the doorway.

—

The first shot came before she took her second step out.

Angharad did not flinch nor slow, knowing it would mean death. The bullet hit stone as she raced down the steps, ricocheting wildly. Two more plumes of smoke billowed out and she leaned into the rush, almost falling forward rather than running, and felt something whiz right past her head as the other short went wide. Three, she counted, and kept running. Halfway down. The fourth shot was not for her, far behind, and revealed that Tupoc was following behind. The fifth came from right to the left of her, smoke blowing past the twisted branches of a tree, and Angharad screamed as she felt warmth and pain bloom on the side of her cheek.

She tripped forward, landing in a roll at the bottom of the stairs as the six shot was drowned out by the barking of the hounds being released.

Only the shot had come from behind, not ahead, and ten feet ahead of Angharad a cultist screamed as a bullet took him in the chest. His musket fell to the ground, firing aimlessly, and she gasped in relief as blood began trickling down her cheek. The hounds ran out of the woods, a tide of teeth and rage, and she smoothly rose with her blade at the ready. Above her shots sounded, the volley Song had arranged downing half the dogs in a single breath, but other shots peppered the trees and ground instead.

A heartbeat later Tupoc was at her side, spear spinning lazily, and a heartbeat after thatchaos took the reins.

Angharad danced back, spearing a hound through the head, while Tupoc batted away another with the bottom of his spear and kicked the third in the head. A shot from ahead, curses from the woods and after that the melee seized her whole. Cultists came pouring out of woods, bearing axes and swords, shouting war cries in their strange tongue as Tupoc laughed and Angharad snarled. Teeth ripped at her coat and she turned an axe blow to run the man through, ripping her blade free with a squelch as the rest of the company charged down the stairs behind her.

They came for her fervently, as if she were a proving ground, and Angharad met them with cold focus: faces marred with that strange red eye flashed one after another, shots illuminating the dark as she slashed at a man’s face and caught a woman’s wrist before her axe could rip into her side. She threw the axe-wielder to the side, into Cozme – who opened her throat with a knife without batting an eye – and then somehow, suddenly, the cultists were retreating. Running back into the woods.

Only not all of them had come out with blades: there was a shot from deeper in the woods, then one from the tower a second later.

Angharad ducked, hardly alone in that, but it was not her that’d been aimed at. There was a shout from behind and she turned to see Brun leaning over a fallen silhouette. Angharad’s heart leapt into her throat. No, she thought. No. Only she must have spoken it out loud, as the others parted around her as she moved.  She stumbled forward, blood dripping down her blade and hand, and knelt in the grass besides the fallen body.

Half of Isabel Ruesta’s face was a red ruin, the shot having taken her in the eye.

She must have been spun around by death, Angharad thought, for she was facing the wrong way: the tower instead of her killer in the woods. Brun laid a hand on her shoulder.

“We need to move, Lady Angharad,” the man said. “The cultists gave up too easily, the rest of their warband must be close.”

“He’s right.”

Song was coming down the stairs, her musket in hand. Her face was a blank mask, betraying nothing of her thoughts. She had not been fond of Isabel, Angharad knew, but must have known better than to speak of it now.

“Now we run or we die,” the Tianxi evenly continued. “Say your farewells, but do not linger. It is behind you, and life ahead.”

A cruelty, Angharad thought, but meant kindly. She was saying it so others would not. Looking down at the corpse that had been Isabel, she brushed back the curls over the wound and swallowed. She thought of that first evening on the Bluebell, when she had seen the infanzona standing on the bridge like a jewel set in a crown of stars, and allowed herself grief. She closed the remaining eye, wiped a half-formed tear from her own and rose to her feet. Shalini, she saw, was carrying Ishaan’s corpse on her back again.

Angharad put down Isabel Ruesta in the last of their fire , leaving her to burn, and on her back instead carried the weight of yet another failure.

—

Zenzele’s lantern died out half an hour in.

They stumbled forward in the dark during what felt like hours but could have been any amount of time at all – exhaustion stretched seconds into minutes, every breath into an odyssey. Only Song’s unfailing eyes kept them from drifting about aimlessly, the Tianxi surefooted as a cat as she led them through a sea of looming trees and threatening silhouettes. They’d left behind the beaten earth road, afraid the cultists would hunt them down it.

Limbs burning and eyes tearing up, Angharad forced herself to follow closely behind Song. It was only once they climbed up a steep hill, clutching at root and stones, that the Tianxi’s steps finally stuttered. There was no need to ask why: in the distance, over the crown of trees, pale lights burned tall and proud.

“The outpost,” Angharad breathed out. “If it is that.”

“There is,” Song replied, “only one way to find out.”

The promise of an end to the road, of some semblance of safety, brought strength back to their tired limbs. They picked up the pace as much as they could, Shalini once more trailing behind. Once they were close enough the light began to cast shadows, they risked going back to the beaten earth road. It shortened the last leg of their journey, until at last they felt the touch of Glare-infused light wash over their skins again. Blinking away the blinding brightness, Angharad found she was not looking at a fort.

Atop a flat hill a tall palisade had been raised, ringed by even taller lamplights. Through open gates the noblewoman saw the bones of a small town: houses and shops, muddy streets and even some kind of great hall. And there were people inside, moving about. Closer to that as well, for outside the open gates two men were keeping guard in padded tunics and breastplates as they loosely held muskets. It was not them that kept her gaze, though, or even the town itself.

Along the last of the road to the gates, two dozen wooden spikes at been raised on either side. Most were bare, but nine were adorned with the impaled corpses of men whose skin was too pale to be anything but darklings. Some of the dead were fresh enough they still dripped.

“Well,” Tupoc mused, “they seem like lovely folk. Shall we go and introduce ourselves?”

It wasn’t, Angharad thought, as if there was much of a choice. It was either trying the town or trying the cultists again. She itched to cast her mind forward, to seek vision of what would unfold if they approached, but she had already burned her candle too bright. Anymore of that and it would be her that burned instead.

They would have to do it the hard way instead.

“Let’s,” Angharad replied, and stepped into the light.

# Chapter 39

Maryam woke up halfway through the hall, which helped a lot.

Even groggy as she was she could stumble forward while leaning on his side, which was a distinct improvement from carrying her on his back. Tristan had been worried about her, as being knocked unconscious was rarely the end of one’s troubles, but though she had a hard time focusing her eyes her mind seemed all there. Enough to insult him, anyway, which he took as a good sign.

“You carried me,” Maryam doubtfully repeated. “Did you happen have a cart at hand?”

Tristan glared. He was not that skinny.

“I can still leave you behind,” he threatened.

“But then who will catch you when you leap off a cliff for the third time?” she shot back.

“It was really more of a fall this time,” he argued. “And not, by the strictest definition, a-”

“If you have breath enough to talk,” Yong bit out from ahead, “then run faster.”

The older man was not doing well. He was barely ahead of them even though Tristan was helping someone. There was a hole in the back of his coat where Vasanti had shot him, perhaps an inch to the side of the spine – it was a ragged, red thing. The thief could not easily tell with the coat on, but he thought it might be high enough a lung would be a at risk.

Gods, let it not have pierced a lung. That was an ugly way to die.

The ground shook beneath their feet again, a reminder that Yong’s anger was not senseless. A glance behind told him that the cavernous room at the top of the pillar was still there, but for how long? Sooner or later the weight would drag the whole thing down like a spear into the Red Maw’s heart. Cutting out the chatter, the pair followed after Yong as best they could.

It was a close thing, but when the hall behind them snapped like a twig they did not fall with it. They’d pulled ahead enough, though Tristan knew better than to stop. He’d glimpsed the parting gift of the devils and it was not going to stop at the pillar spearing down: without that structure serving as support, the entire mountaintop was going to crumble inwards.

It would be best if they were not there to crumble with it.

It was a strange thing, their race to the end of the hall. On the one hand fear – and the cloud of dust behind them – kept them wide awake and attentive, death looming ever close. On the other, the length of the hallway was aggressively monotonous. It was all bare stone in a dim light of no clear source, perfectly symmetrical and utterly empty. The kind of sight that made you fall asleep.

Thrice the thief found his gaze drifting, seeking corners and angles, and he thought he might have been tiring until he realized what he truly was doing: looking for Fortuna. There was no trace of her, not leaning against a wall and smirking or even effortlessly keeping pace with him in her red dress. She was just gone. Tristan felt his breath shortening, a dim fear seizing him by the throat.

“Tristan.”

What if she never came back? What if the way he’d pulled on the contract had killed her? She was a small god, near forgotten, and if he’d taken too much from her she might have…

“Tristan,” Maryam hissed. “Focus, we’re nearly there. We’re going to be fine.”

The thief came back to himself, his back covered in cold sweat, and bit his lip hard enough to draw blood. The pain centered him, kept him in there and now. He could not think about this, about how he might have lost the only person who’d never left, who could not die – he could not think about this.

Maryam was right, they were nearly at the end of the hall. All around them stone shuddered, the distant hallway falling apart as dust and dirt clouded sight but not the cacophonous noise. Ahead of them waited a smooth iron gate, and Tristan could but pray that it was not locked for if it was then they might well be dead. Yong was the one to reach it, and though there was no handle for him to push when he touched it the gate began opening on its own, sliding into the wall.

It was an unsettling sight, though not unsettling enough to stop him from taking refuge in the room past the gate.

The room was, he found when following after Maryam, little more than a glorified antechamber. There were racks on the wall from which nothing hung and two doorways on the sides leading into other halls. More importantly, though, was the broad gate – twice as long as it was tall – covering the entire back wall of the room. There were broad stripes of cryptoglyphs on the ground before it, beyond their understanding now that Francho was dead. Tristan’s teeth clenched.

It had been a quick death, he told himself.

“It must lead outside,” Yong said, eyeing the wall-gate as his breath came in pants. “There was nothing at the end of the hall in the projection we saw.”

The ceiling above them rumbled, softly lapping away at the silence.

“We cannot go through so long as there is a landslide,” Tristan said. “We’ll have to wait.”

The Tianxi grimaced.

“And if the landslide blocked the door?”

“Then we will try one of the other halls,” Maryam said. “We are not yet out of options, Yong.”

The veteran looked away.

“I suppose not,” he said.

Tristan cleared his throat.

“If we are to wait, then I would have a look at your wound,” he said.

The Tianxi turned, eyes cool.

“I can move just fine,” he said. “That is not necessary.”

Yong had never declined that offer before. The thief knew why he now had – though much had happened since, their conversation at the summit of the pillar was still fresh in his mind. Irritation rose.

“Disdain won’t stop your bleeding,” he coldly replied. “But if sanctimony is the hill you want to die on, by all means spare me the waste of bandages.”

He almost winced after saying it, seeing the way the other man’s face tightened, but he did not look away. It had not been the right way to handle that, and were he less tired he might have finessed his way into something better, but Tristan had been brutalized enough by his day he wasn’t sure he cared. Worse, he was pretty sure that the poppy was beginning to fade.

The dull ache in his everything was something of a hint.

“Would you have preferred picking out the hill for me?” Yong replied just as coldly. “That does seem to be your favorite racket.”

“All right, that’s enough of that,” Maryam said, stepping in between them with a tired look on her face. “Tristan, you left everyone in the dark as to your actual plan until the last moment. He’s got a right to be angry.”

A pause, then her eyes met his.

“I am too,” she frankly said. “This just isn’t the time or place for us to have that talk.”

His lips thinned. If Francho hadn’t been killed, would either of them even… Maryam turned to Yong with a smidgeon more sympathy, but only that.

“You know he’s never turned it on any of us,” she flatly said. “It’s childish to pretend he’s trying to do anything but keeping you from bleeding out. You can still be angry after he’s helped you – I am.”

“You don’t understand,” Yong said.

“Neither will the bullet in your back,” she brutally replied. “You need to get that seen to, and there’s only one of us who knows how.”

It was hard to argue with that, even though Yong looked like he wanted to. It was in a slightly sullen silence that they set about the examination. Yong laid out his coat and clothes on the ground, stripped down to the waist, and laid down with his belly on the coat. Kneeling by the older man, Tristan rinsed his hands in booze and leaned close. The Tianxi shivered when a droplet of drink fell onto his back.

“Cold,” Yong muttered.

Tristan did not answer, his face pulling into a frown. He wasn’t as familiar with gun wounds as those from knives or cudgels – he’d worked as a cutter’s assistant, not under a military surgeon – but he knew he wasn’t looking at the good kind of wound. If it had been a musket instead of a pistol he was shot with, Yong would have died. Reaching for a rag from his bag, he soaked it in alcohol and after cleaning the wound set about checking how deep the ball had penetrated. Yong’s shivering moan of pain went ignored.

The thief stopped almost immediately, letting out a noise of surprise.

“Tristan?” Yong croaked out. “What is it?”

The grey-eyed man grimaced.

“I’m going to have to feel out your ribs,” he said. “It’s going to hurt.”

The Tianxi cursed.

“Give me the bottle,” he said. “I-”

“You’re already drunk,” Tristan sharply said. “I’m not letting you thin your blood any further, you’ll kill yourself.”

“Fuck,” Yong quietly muttered, then breathed in. “Do it.”

He forced himself not to hear the man’s groans as he felt out the ribs, pressing the flesh enough to feel the lack of give beneath and – Yong let out a scream. Tristan’s fingers pulled away. He’d learned what he needed to anyway.

“You have been,” Tristan said, “extremely lucky. It may yet kill you.”

Maryam cocked an eyebrow at him.

“Well,” she said, “I guess there’s a reason you’re not in charge of morale around here.”

“I’m not convinced he should be in charge of medicine either,” Yong groaned from the ground, laying his forehead against his coat.

He stayed like that for a few breaths, mastering himself, then raised his head again.

“All right,” the Tianxi said. “Tell me.”

“When Vasanti shot you from behind, she hit your rib,” Tristan said. “It’s the reason why there’s currently not a hole in your lung.”

“We may need to work on your definition of lucky,” Maryam noted.

“No,” Yong quietly disagreed. “He’s right. I’ve seen men get shot in the lung, this was fine luck. Now give me the bad news.”

“The impact shattered your rib and broke off at least one large piece,” the thief said. “I’d need to open you up to be sure – and that might well kill you even if I was a real physician – but I think that right now the bullet is what’s keeping that piece from stabbing into your lung.”

Maryam had nothing pithy to add to that. Yong swallowed.

“What can I do?”

“Nothing,” Tristan honestly said. “If we get you to a Watch surgeon in Three Pines they can remove the bullet and the broken off piece, but trying the same here with a knife would be like…”

The only words that came to him were too light, too teasing.

“It would be kinder to use the knife to slit your throat, let’s leave it at that.”

The veteran slowly nodded.

“How long do I have?”

The calm, Tristan thought, was the worst part of it. Yong had an almost serene look on his face, like the thought of dying didn’t move him at all. Like all he was wondering about was the schedule, the details of the marching orders to his grave. Maybe it was about knowing death, Tristan thought. That old friend walked with all the children of the Murk, but none of them knew it the way a soldier would. Someone who’d seen a hundred lives be snuffed out in a heartbeat, washed away by a wave of smoke and lead. Maybe it wasn’t so scary when you’d seen so much of it.

Somehow, he couldn’t quite bring himself to believe that.

“I can’t tell,” Tristan admitted. “Depending on how the rib broke that piece could be wedged tight in place or it could be on the edge of coming loose. Could be hours, could be days, could be a year.”

The thief licked his lips.

“Avoid moving too fast and getting hit in the torso, that’s the best advice I can give you.”

His gaze broke away from the Tianxi’s as he reached for his bag.

“I’ll bandage it,” he added. “It might help some, and we need to keep that wound from getting infected as long as possible.”

The wound going bad might kill the other man before the rib piece did. Yong’s forehead went back down and he did not say anything after that.

None of them did, waiting in silence until the last of the rumbling above passed.

—

The last iron gate parted open at a touch, both sides fleeing into the wall – though one got stuck halfway through, some unseen metal gear letting out a strident cry as it tried to force the matter and ended up breaking for it.

Wary as that sound had made them, they still hurried out into the small natural cave past the gate. The iron wall closed behind them, save for the part that’d got stuck. Yong’s lantern showed there was a worn fire pit in here and some coal drawing on the walls along with words in a language Tristan did not know. At least one of them was a name, he figured, written above a pretty obscene drawing of a man thrusting his phallus at an airavatan’s buttocks.

“Charming,” Maryam drily said.

“It hasn’t been used recently,” Yong said, eyes on the pit. “Still, it looks like hollows know of this place.”

Tristan drew back to lay his hand on the iron gate, who confirmed his suspicions by not moving an inch. It only opened from the inside, then. The hollows had never gotten into the pillar. By the time he returned the other two had moved on, leaving the cave and stopping on a ledge right outside of it. Tristan joined them, inhaling the faint breeze with a smile as he pressed down his tricorn. Above them the veiled lights of firmament shone, cold and unmoving stars. They had made it out.

For a long moment they stayed there, savoring the simple truth of that.

Tristan was the first to stir. His gaze turned below, where a great dark forest spread out – through there was a ring of light nestled in its heart, to the northeast. The glow was pale enough it must have Glare to it. Some kind of Watch outpost? He was not the only one who had begun looking around, as Yong made clear when he let out a soft curse in Cathayan.

“It looks like we won’t be getting to sanctuary,” the Tianxi said.

Their gate out of the mountain was facing the Watch fort on the other side, but it did not need to when even from where they stood they could see the aftermath of a massive landslide gone down that slope. The blackcloak fort had been on that same side, they all knew, which was less than promising. Feeling Yong’s gaze grown colder when it moved back to him, Tristan held his hands up in protest.

“We don’t know that the place got buried,” he said. “And even if it did, Wen told me they have a vault below. Odds are it has a hidden passage they can use to get out of the mess.”

“You had best hope they do,” Yong said. “Else they might shoot you for this at Three Pines.”

Tristan was not the one who had caused the collapse, but he was disinclined to pass the blame onto Maryam.

“Vasanti caused all this,” he said instead. “She forced us at gunpoint to trigger the trap the devils left behind because of her obsession with controlling the Antediluvian device.”

Yong looked unconvinced and he felt Maryam’s blue eyes on him. She said nothing, tacitly agreeing to his take on events. Since the Tianxi had been down during most of the confrontation with Vasanti, potentially unconscious, he was in no position to argue the tale.

“It doesn’t matter,” Yong said. “Even if they get out we won’t be finding them out in the dark. They’ll be headed to Three Pines, at a guess.”

The port at the northern end of the island, Tristan thought, and likely where the Trial of Weeds ended.

“Or that place,” he said, pointing at the distant ring of lights in the woods. “Sarai, what did the map say about it?”

“Sarai?” Yong mildly said. “And here I thought her name was Maryam.”

Tristan grimaced. Shit, he’d let that slip during the mess inside hadn’t he? He sent his friend an apologetic look, which she dismissed with a hand.

“You can call me Maryam too,” she told the Tianxi. “Though I would ask you both to use Sarai in front of others.”

She got the nods she was seeking, then sighed.

“And the map did not say anything about what that place is,” she said. “It was marked, however, and a road through the woods that ultimately leads to the port goes through it. We have nothing to lose by taking a look.”

“If it’s a Watch outpost they might have surgeon,” Tristan told Yong. “Given how far the port is, it seems our best chance at keeping your ribs out of your lung.”

A little explicit for his tastes, but that ought to remind the man of how much danger he was in with every step he took.

“It does seem the wisest course,” Yong said. “If there are blackcloaks there, we may also learn what the Trial of Weeds is meant to be.”

“It’s settled, then,” Maryam said. “Let us get moving before the rest of this mountain comes down on our heads.”

“Or worse,” Tristan fervently agreed. “Lieutenant Wen warned me about cultists out here, they’re the worst of the lot.”

It’d be a stroke of luck if the landslide had taken care of that for them, so he felt safe betting on the opposite.

—

There were remains of what the Antediluvians must have used to get up and down mountain once upon a time, some kind of half-buried machine whose sharp glittering spikes rose out of the dirt. None of them would have any idea how to get such a thing working – if it still worked at all – so instead they went down the old-fashioned way. Hollows clearly camped in the cave on occasion, so it was just a matter of finding the path they used to come here.

It turned out to be a glorified goat trail snaking down the mountainside, narrow and made even steeper when the earlier collapse had shaken off loose rocks. Tristan was no stranger to heights but he still stepped warily, for a single slip here would likely be enough to kill him. For the better part of an hour they descended, the path widening as they got closer to the bottom, until finally they were able to leave the narrow trail for a bit.

They’d heard the waterfall long before they saw it. Tucked away in the mountainside, it spat out the end of some river from the maze onto the rest of the island. There was a crossing through the water, a loose path of jutting stones that the wet had turned dangerously slippery. They took their time moving across, which was the reason Tristan even noticed something was amiss. Frowning, he clutched the side of the stone he was standing on and went fishing in the foamy water.

What he got for his trouble was a ripped doublet.

“Tristan?”

“Found something,” he told Maryam.

He held up the dripping doublet into the lantern light, catching blood on the edge of the rips. The thief let out a low whistle when he realized it wasn’t a simple case of the doublet having been torn: it was the same hole on both sides, more or less, so it was the remains of an impalement he was looking at.

“Old clothes?” Maryam said, taking a closer look. “Didn’t think you were that hard up.”

“I’ve seen that doublet before,” he said. “So have you.”

She blinked.

“The colors,” she slowly said.

“House Cerdan,” he confirmed. “It belonged to the elder brother, I believe.”

“So there’s a half-naked infanzon corpse somewhere in the maze,” Maryam said. “This has not been a good year for the Cerdan.”

Tristan smoothed away his smile. Yong had not disapproved of his taking revenge earlier, for all that the man had not known the details, but that had been before their disagreements. It was best kept under wraps now. Besides, he thought, what was Yong actually-

“I wouldn’t be so sure about that,” the Tianxi called out.

Yong had crossed all the way to the other side of the waterfall, at the edge of the lantern light, and was standing by a dead tree. The thief couldn’t make it out well, so he tossed the doublet back into the water and set about catching up. A waste – it was good fabric, might have fetched silver in the right shop – but he did not want carry any more weight than he had to. Maryam let out a startled noise within moments of reaching the other shore and Tristan soon saw why: there were footprints in the mud.

Someone had crawled out of the water onto the shore. The real surprise, though, was by the tree Yong was still closely studying.  It was not dead the way Tristan had first thought. While he was no woodsman, he knew what a dead tree looked like. Dry wood, bark gone grey and dry if there was still any at all. The tree instead looked like it’d been scourged: there were slight furrows, as if a thin cutting whip had been wielded at it, and only around these marks was the tree dead. The rest of it looked fine, untouched.

“Contract,” Yong said.

“Contract,” Maryam agreed.

“Contract,” Tristan concluded.

And it did not look like the pleasant kind.

“Augusto Cerdan got impaled by something large, if his doublet is any indication,” the thief said. “It seems to me he might have struck a pact – any pact at all – to live through that.”

“If it truly was a bargain with the Red Maw, the Watch will kill him for it,” Maryam noted.

Tristan had been hoping the champion of the downtrodden would take care of this for him – really, Tredegar, how hard could it possibly be to off someone you’d publicly sworn to kill in a duel? – but he’d settle for the Watch instead if that was on the table.

“They might have,” Yong said, “if they were not under several tons of rock.”

Tristan grimaced. A fair point, even if its tone was slightly accusing.

“The only way off this island is the port at Three Pines,” he said. “They would check before letting him onto the boat, surely.”

“Our ship should stay until all the trial-takers are arrived or believed dead, anyway,” Maryam said. “We’ll have time to tell the blackcloaks of our suspicions”

“If we live to inform them,” Yong said.

“That is the plan,” Tristan reminded him.

“You always do have one of those, don’t you?” the Tianxi said.

Though the man was smiling, it was not a compliment. Irritation could wait until they were in a safer place, Tristan reminded himself.

“The path to the outpost won’t walk itself,” Maryam said. “Still, let’s keep an eye out for the Cerdan as we go. I doubt anything capable of that-”

She pointed at the mangled tree.

“- is going to be all that friendly,” she finished.

Yong hesitated.

“We cannot know for sure it is a Red Maw contract,” he said.

I would want to kill him even if it isn’t, Tristan thought. The more diplomatic ‘that contract seems dangerous regardless’ was on the tip of his tongue, but he was not so blind as to be unaware that if it came out of his mouth Yong was unlikely to agree. Best let Maryam take care of it instead.

“Yong, it’s a maze full of starved and half-mad gods,” the blue-eyed woman said. “The Maw was the worst, sure, but there were plenty of things in there almost as bad.”

Tristan saw in the muscles of the neck that the veteran was about to glance his way, so he looked away first. A moment passed, then Yong sighed.

“Fair enough,” he conceded. “I won’t shoot on sight, Maryam, but neither will I approach him if we find him.”

An awkward silence stretched on after that, until Tristan cleared his throat.

“We should fill our waterskins before moving on,” he said. “We might not get another occasion any time soon.”

A few minutes for that and then they were back on the trail.

—

They found no further traces of Augusto Cerdan on the way down, not for lack of looking.

There was no telling if he had made it off the mountain, though Tristan’s instincts whispered that he had. The man would not have made it this far if he was the kind to lay down and die. The thief could respect that kind of mettle, in truth, so as a gesture of goodwill he would try to kill Augusto standing instead. So long as it was not particularly inconvenient, anyway.

The woods below were no easier to navigate than those in the Trial of Lines had been, though at least the thief had gotten used to such journeys. Their pace remained slow. Tristan had not noticed on the mountain, where the prospect of taking a tumble down the cliff had kept all their movements sedate, but Yong was at the edge of his rope. His breath was labored and his hair drenched with sweat. By unspoken agreement he and Maryam let the man take the lead so he could set the pace. She held the lantern, though, to relieve him of the weight.

The thief fiddled with his hat, adjusting it unnecessarily as he debated calling for a halt so the Tianxi might rest. It might be better to wait a little longer, he thought, perhaps until they reached the road. Maryam had guided them in what was the right direction according to the map stored in her head, but a direction was the most she had been able to provide: until they hit the supposed road through the forest, they would have no real notion of where they actually were.

“Lights,” Yong suddenly rasped out. “Maryam, kill the lantern.”

She snuffed it out in a moment and they huddled together behind a bush, peering through the leaves to watch the approaching lights Yong had picked out. And no wonder he had, the thief thought: there were a great many of them. At least ten torches were being held up, though not a single one of them burned pale. Hollows, he thought. Cultists. So much for his half-formed hope they had run into the other group of trial-takers.

Assuming they had lived through the mountain’s collapse.

His suspicions were confirmed when the torches came closer, all their shoulders tensing as a warband of pale-skinned cultist began gathering in a small clearing slightly ahead of them. There was a great deal of talk going on, and though they were not close enough to hear the words being spoken they were close enough to see the situation unfold. Two silhouettes in chain mail coats, both armed with long swords, were squaring off in an argument. One kept gesturing further in the woods, as if insisting they go off, while the other refused.

Both looked close to drawing blades, and though they kept flicking looks at the black-robed priest watching them from the back she said not a word. Tristan had flinched when he first saw her face in the torchlight: it was a ruin of red scars, near every inch of it covered by hungry maws. All the other cultists, of which there must be at least two dozen, were very careful around her – as if the slightest of gestures might bring about her ire.

“They have muskets,” Yong murmured. “At least ten of them.”

“There might be more,” Tristan replied just as quietly. “Wen told me they take them from Watch patrols.”

None of them were comfortable staying so close to the enemy but there was little choice. Had they bolted earlier maybe they might have had a chance to sneak away, but it was too late now. They would not slip away unseen when trying to shake off the cultists in their own favorite hunting grounds.

“I think one of them is saying they need to pursue people,” Maryam said. “They might have found the others.”

“Or the Watch garrison from the other fort,” Tristan said.

“Could be either,” Yong muttered. “And they like their sacrifices, the Red Maw, so why is the other one arguing against it?”

It took half an hour before they got an answer. A smaller band of five or so cultists joined the rest, two of them carrying a pair of wooden poles to which someone was bound. Though they were far and the torchlight flickering, Tristan would have recognized that mangled face even if the colored undershirt hadn’t given the game away.

“Oh, that poor bastard,” Yong said.

Unlike the older man, Tristan did not find it in him to muster pity as he watched Augusto Cerdan get carried into the crowd. Instead his eyes were on the ripped undershirt, which was still stained with blood and revealed the flesh beneath. And there was something… off about that flesh. It looked like a wound, only it was nowhere as deep as it should be – the infanzon had been impaled – and the wounded flesh looked oddly stringy. Like strung-out pieces of red yarn.

The cultists cheered the captured, the triumphant hunters earning much praise and backslapping from the rest. The only sullen face was the armored man who had been arguing to leave in pursuit, and the moment his dark eyes lingered on Augusto the thief knew what would happen. He wanted to vent his anger and there was a designated victim at hand. The cultists strolled up with a sneer and kicked the Cerdan in the ribs, the infanzon letting out a groan of pain.

Those boots were simple leather, lacking armor, but the thief imagined that would be of little comfort to Augusto. Some cultists cheered the blow, acclaim that the sneering armored man wasted no time in chasing again. Two more kicks, the noble wriggling in pain, until the man turned to face the crowd and speak in some hollow cant. Whatever he’d said prompted laughter.

Then Augusto Cerdan’s hand struck out like a viper, fingers sliding inside the cultists’ boot, and the laughter went away.

The hollow let out a terrible scream, bloody furrows forming across every visible inch of skin and digging deep. After two heartbeats he fell, twitching and bleeding, and as the rest of the cultists drew their arms in an uproar the infanzon began laughing on the ground. He was, Tristan realized, no longer wounded. Not on his face, not where he’d been impaled. It was all smooth and healthy skin, though still caked in blood. His companions went still at the sight, having noticed it as well. Does he feed on the living?

The thief bit his lip. Whatever the Cerdan had gotten out of the tree he’d fed on, it had not healed him in full. Only now that a man had been turned into a bloody mess did he look untouched. What he feeds on must shape what he gets from it, Tristan thought. It sounded like a powerful contract, for all that flesh to flesh contract seemed to be required, which likely meant there was more to it. No god would grant such power without thorns and a steep price to swallow.

The cultists swarmed angrily, several hitting a still-laughing Augusto with the bottom of their spear or the flat of their sword, but they would not kill him. He was a sacrifice. Some seemed to be arguing for mutilation, however, and blades were bared.

Then the priest came out of the shadows, stepping fully into the torchlight, and silence fell over the clearing.

The young woman spoke softly, cultists hurrying to obey. Augusto was cut free of the poles and dragged upright, the infanzon grinning wildly as the priest stepped closer. She leaned forward, face so close to the man she must have been able to smell his breath, before suddenly smiling. She pressed a soft kiss against his cheek, almost girlishly, and Tristan breathed in. Only she did not fall screaming, to the Cerdan’s visible surprise.

The priest raised up his hand, announcing something in the hollow cant, and after a heartbeat of utter surprise the cultists hurried to kneel before them.

“Well,” Maryam quietly said. “I think we can now safely assume our friend Augusto has a Red Maw contract, can’t we?”

—

It took another half hour for the warband to move on after that distressing bit of theatre.

Augusto obviously did not understand the hollow cant, but several of the cultists appeared to know some Antigua. There was a lot of gesticulation accompanying the words, but some kind of understanding was eventually reached. The infanzon stole the sword and cloak of the armored man he’d mutilated to the protest of no one, sticking close to the priest and talking animatedly as the hollows headed deeper into the woods. The three of them remained in hiding for minutes more after the last was gone, just in case.

“That,” Tristan mildly said, “is going to be a problem.”

“He probably can’t heal from a bullet to the head,” Yong opined. “I’d just need to get close enough.”

“That would mean getting close to the hollows,” Maryam said. “Best we leave him to the Watch, I think.”

“I won’t argue that,” Tristan grunted. “I’m not sold on following them too closely, though.”

“Best we give them a head start,” Yong agreed.

“Can’t be too much of one,” Maryam warned, “else we risk running into them while they’re on their way back.”

That was a risk, Tristan acknowledged.

“Any idea where they’re headed?” he asked.

“Same way we are,” she grimly replied. “It’s safe bet they are also aiming for the road through the woods.”

“Then we go around them,” Yong said. “Circle past their position and then take the path the rest of the way to the outpost.”

It seemed a reasonable plan, so they settled on that. Giving the cultists an hour to pull further ahead was what was decided on, and Tristan volunteered to keep watch if the others wanted to rest. Maryam did not waste a heartbeat accepting, using her pack as a pillow and cocooning in the bush. Yong did too, after some hesitation. The thief settled against a tree, blackjack close to his hand, and leant his back against the bark. The last of the poppy was fading, so at least he was at no risk of falling asleep: it was hard to contemplate lying down when your body and soul were as a single giant bruise.

It was boring, looking out into the dark and staring at every shaking leaf, but it needed doing anyway. He checked Vanesa’s watch regularly, more than he needed to in truth. It was less risky than letting his thoughts drift. It was when he was having a look for then tenth time that the silence was broken by a croaking whisper.

“How long?” Yong asked.

“Twenty-three minutes,” Tristan said. “Over half left, you can go back to sleep.”

“Can’t,” the Tianxi admitted. “The pain keeps waking me up.”

Going by the loud snoring, Maryam was having no such trouble.

“I don’t have anything left to take the edge off,” the thief said. “If you have a hard time moving, we may have to risk the drink.”

Risky, given that Yong was likely still bleeding inside, but less risky than moving at a slug’s pace in a forest full of Red Maw fanatics armed to the teeth. The older man breathed out.

“I can still take it,” he said. “I’ll make it to the outpost, at least.”

Tristan nodded, though he was not sure if the Tianxi saw him in the dark. He said nothing more.

“You don’t regret it at all, do you?” Yong suddenly said. “Sending the watchmen into a trap.”

Half a dozen replies were on the tip of his tongue, ways to wiggle out of the growing enmity between them. I also warned them about the trap, he could have said, or Vasanti was going to kill me otherwise, I had no choice, or Wen forced my hand in exchange for his protection. Degrees of truths, degrees of lies. Only Yong had saved his life. More than once. And that would only have weighed so much, if honesty was likely to get him killed, but it wasn’t.

So he told the truth.

“No,” Tristan said. “I regret letting down my guard at the end, not thinking to keep a watch on the second lift, but nothing else of how things unfolded.”

He could almost feel Yong’s jaw clench.

“You made those men into a distraction,” the Tianxi said. “Good as sacrificed them.”

“This isn’t Diecai, Yong,” he tiredly said. “I’m not your gloryhound general throwing away conscripts for a victory: I did it this way because I thought that plan had the best chance of us living through it.”

“No, Tristan,” Yong quietly replied. “You know that is untrue. It is why you kept me in the dark until it was too late. You chose that plan because it had the best chance of you surviving. There were other options, options I might have chosen had I known. They were simply more dangerous for you.”

And that was the truth, Tristan knew. He’d forced Wen’s hand by telling Boria because he did not trust the lieutenant to protect him against Vasanti otherwise. And he knew he could have tried to sell out Wen’s demand – the destruction of the device – to Vasanti in exchange for safe passage through the pillar. It would have put him at risk, but the old woman had never shown hostility against the rest of his crew so they likely would have been safe. The danger would have been all on him.

There’d been other plays, other tricks to attempt, but he had not truly considered them because Yong was right. They had been more dangerous for him.

“The hungry bite, the beggared snatch, the cornered fight,” Tristan softly quoted, looking up at the dark canopy above. “I am what I am, Yong.”

And he would make no apology for that. There was a long silence.

“Fear I can forgive,” Yong finally said. “We all own some of that devil’s hide. But you put me on their side, Tristan.”

He did not need to ask who they were. They, the thief knew, was not a name or a place or a title. It was an idea: the people who make the plans that send other people to die, that send you to march across a plain to your death and it meant nothing at all. They was what Yong had really wanted to kill back in the Republics, when he’d killed that general.

“There are no sides, Yong,” Tristan simply replied. “At end of the day, a grave will only fit one.”

Good men, bad men, kind men, cruel men – that was just paint, pretty color you slapped over the truth. There were the living and the dead, that was the whole of it. You kept out of the grave however you could until your luck ran out.

“That’s not a way to live,” Yong said. “That’s just a way not to die.”

“I’m not an ambitious man,” Tristan replied. “I’ll settle for that.”

The veteran said nothing, but the silence was not an empty one. It felt, Tristan thought, like a door closing. He resisted the urge to fill the void, stilled his tongue.

“One day,” Yong said, “you’ll look back on your life. And on that day I hope you’ll find more than corpses lying in your wake.”

The soldier sighed.

“We can leave it at that,” he said. “All of it.”

The thief closed his eyes, breathing out. He had known from the start that it was sheer greed to try to keep too many of his companions. Survival had costs, sometimes in coin less obvious. To feel disappointment here, to feel regret, it would have been a kind of vanity.

Tristan was vainer than he’d thought.

—

When the hour passed they began to take the long way around.

Opening the lantern’s shutters all the way was too risky so it was with only a thin slice of light to guide them that they ventured into the dark. And Maryam, despite her best efforts, could only guide them so much: she had a map tucked away in her memory, not a compass, and in these damn woods everything looked the same. Without any landmarks to rely on they found a curving path was not so easy to maintain. Twice they got turned around, the first time doubling back to cross a shallow river and the second getting stuck walking around the edge of a steep hill for twenty minutes.

They pushed on for three hours before finally slowing down when they came in sight of old ruins: three large worn pillars atop a platform, crowned by a circle of stone that was more than half gone.

“I don’t suppose that was on the map?” Tristan asked.

“No,” Maryam grunted. “Most of the ruins we encountered weren’t. This island has too many to count, I expect.”

“Maryam,” Yong softly said. “Shutter the lights.”

She did so without batting an eye, pulling close to him, and as the Tianxi took cover behind a tree the thief mirrored him behind another. Moments later a pair of cultists came out of the thicker woods ahead – both armed with spears and wearing leather, long hair going down their backs. They were talking rather loudly, ambling around until they both leaned against pillars and started what Tristan just knew was complaining even if he could not understand the language. That intonation was universal.

“Trouble,” he whispered. “Go around?”

“I think we’re at the edge of their guard picket,” Yong whispered back. “If we get them quietly, we can press on straight to the road.”

Tristan mulled on that, hesitating. Their attempted curve around where they thought the cultists might be had probably ended up closer to the outline of some demented ziggurat, but he agreed with Yong’s assumption that theirs had broadly been the right path. It was tempting, the knowledge that instead of risking another hour going around this pair or waiting them out they might instead solve the problem and press on before their foes caught on.

“Maryam?” he asked.

“They’ll know we’re out here if we kill any of them,” she whispered. “But I think the risk is worth it – they’re obviously waiting on something, if they are posting guards. It might be they’re making camp.”

Tristan was not so sure a camp was being made – hollows often kept odd hours, unmoored from the Glare as they were – but it was true that guards being about meant the cultists were no longer on the move.

“All right,” the thief conceded. “We drop them quiet, then.”

The pair might not be paying much attention, but they weren’t blind and whatever friends they had out there would not be deaf. Tristan circled around their back, using the trees as cover until the angle of the pillars covered his approach. He crept out of the trees then, steps excruciatingly careful, and saw Yong follow close behind – sword already out, tucked under his arm. Controlling his breath, the thief reached for his blackjack and palmed it as he pressed himself against the pillar. He turned to meet Yong’s eyes, raising a hand and then beginning to pull down one finger after another.

Four, three, two, one-

They sprung out from behind the pillar just as one of the cultists snorted out a laugh at what her companion had said. Eyes widened, mouths opened and Tristan cracked his blackjack across the woman’s temple as hard as he could. She dropped and he rushed forward to catch her even as the other hollow’s attempted cry turned into a wet gurgle, Yong slitting his throat. The thief lowered the unconscious cultists, tucked away his blackjack and cleanly snapped her neck the way Abuela had taught him.

The two of them stayed there a moment, breathing under the starlight, and traded a nod. Cleanly done all around. Tristan went riffling around the corpses and found a sheathed knife that fit his palm well tucked away on the woman’s belt, claiming it to replace the one he’d lost. Yong gestured for Maryam to join them and Tristan rose, rolling his shoulder. The bruises from Vasanti’s beating – beatings, really – had him wincing, but it wasn’t as bad as when it had been fresh. Another day or two and he’d be fine.

“That was bracing,” Maryam said, catching up to them. “Shall we-”

A call came out of the woods, to their left, and it all went to shit when a cultist walked out from behind the trees – he was calling out, a laugh on his lips, but froze when he saw them. Yong went for his pistol but the hollow was quicker, screaming out a warning, and three more of his friends came storming in.

“Run,” Tristan hissed.

They fled, the cultists baying after them.

A shot went wide, whizzing into the dark. Trees flashed on both sides at they ran, the shouts of cultists close behind. Were they even heading in the right direction? He had no idea, and there was no time to stop and ask. There were torches behind them soon, close on their trail. The thief could only guess at how many hollows had joined the hunting party, but it was too many to fight. Would have been too many even if they were all hale instead of wounded and exhausted.

Then Yong tripped.

The Tianxi had been slowing for a while, his breath coming in rough pants, but he still hit the root at running speed and fell right into a tree. Swallowing a hoarse shout, Yong rolled on the ground as Tristan cursed and doubled back to help him up.

“Come on,” the thief hissed, offering his hand. “They’re getting-”

Yong took the hand, let himself be hoisted, but almost immediately collapsed.  He cursed in Cathayan.

“My ankle,” he said. “It’s sprained.”

Maryam joined them, warily eyeing the approaching torches.

“What’s happening?” she whispered.

The older man’s face was calm, the same way it had been up in the hall when he had learned his life was on a knife’s edge.

“I can’t run,” he said, then breathed out. “Get moving, I’ll draw them to me. It will buy you a chance.”

The shouts were getting closer.

“Yong,” he said. “I-”

“We have said,” Yong replied, “all there is to say. Run.”

And he wanted to argue, to insist, but the shouts were getting close. The torches burned bright in the dark, heralds of death. Maryam took his arm.

“Tristan,” she whispered.

Shame, the rat told himself, was a luxury. He swallowed, nodding jerkily at the Tianxi, and broke for it. He saw Yong loading his musket with steady hands before running out in the dark, the last he would ever see of the man. Maryam stuck close to him as they ran for a minute, then two. Tristan swallowed, forcing his eyes to stay peeled ahead. Else he would trip as well, and be left behind just like-

“Fuck,” Tristan snarled, and turned around.

Greedy, Abuela’s voice chided. It would get him killed. But even as Maryam called out from behind, cursing as well before he heard her running after him, he found someone waiting for him in the gloom. Sitting on a branch above, long red dress trailing like a curtain of blood, Fortuna smiled an impossibly perfect smile. He almost sobbed in relief.

“You,” he croaked.

“You took a chance,” the Lady of Long Odds simply said. “Now ride your prayer to the end, Tristan.”

He swallowed and nodded, Maryam catching up with him as he did.

“We are going to die,” she told him.

“Maybe,” he said. “Maybe not.”

A pause.

“I’ll abandon you if it looks bad,” she frankly said.

“I’m lucky you came at all,” he replied just as frankly.

She grimaced.

“You are,” Maryam said, then muttered. “And I thought Song had picked the idiot.”

She peeled ahead anyway.

“Come on, he hasn’t fired yet so they don’t know where he is.”

The torches were close, terrifyingly close. When they found Yong he was but a few feet away from where they’d left him, standing with his back against a tree as he held his musket. He saw them coming, his face twisting into something that was both hope and anger and not quite either.

“You-”

“Shut up,” Tristan cut in. “You’ll draw them. Maryam-”

She grunted, taking up one of the Tianxi’s arms while he reached for the other. They hoisted him up between them, dragging him away brusquely enough he would have had to fight them to stop it.

“It won’t work,” he got out, voice sounding raw. “They’re-”

In the distance, shots sounded.

Their pursuers hesitated. They dragged Yong, forging forward as quick as they could. The opportunity was not to be wasted. The pursuers began arguing, at least until shots sounded again – at least a dozen, continued. A real fight. The others or the Watch garrison? Either way, under Tristan’s disbelieving stare the pursuers slowed, stopped and then turned around.

Towards the fight.

The thief choked out an incredulous laugh as he watched the torches get further and further away. Only then did he notice they had gotten back to the branch where Fortuna was perched, having not moved an inch since he last passed her by. A spinning golden coin drew his eye, the goddess snatching it out of the air. She met his eyes, golden eyes alight.

“Lucky you,” the Lady of Long Odds grinned.

—

They made it to the path from the map, stumbling like children, and then followed down the beaten earth. They saw not a soul on the way.

—

The supposed outpost turned out to be a small town, ringed in lamplights and waiting square in the middle of path. That should have been a relief, only there was a slight complication.

“Well,” Tristan said, eyeing the impaled corpses. “I’m willing to go on a limb and call this a bad sign.”

Yong snorted from his place between them.

“Those lamplights give off Glare,” Maryam said. “It shouldn’t be hollows inside, at least.”

“Plenty of wolves hunt by pale light,” Yong replied. “Let me off, you two. I think I can hobble and we’ll look weaker if you’re holding me up.”

And there were people to look weak to, as the Tianxi had seen. A pair of guards came their way, bearing muskets and steel breastplates over padded tunics. Their helms were old-fashioned, going down the back of their necks, but it was hardly comparable to the old relics that the cultists bore. The three of them tensed as the guards approached, though the two men were still holding their muskets up instead of pointing them.

“You with the Watch?” the shorter one called out.

They shared looks, then Maryam shrugged.

“We are,” she called back.

“Come on, then,” the same man said. “The others are inside and we’re closing the gates for night.”

“Trap?” Yong murmured.

“If it is, I’d rather have Tredegar doing my fighting for me,” Tristan opined. “She is much better at it.”

Assuming the mirror-dancer still lived, which was hardly certain.

“Agreed,” Maryam snickered, then sobered. “Besides, they might have a town physician.”

Yong grunted his doubt but did not argue. They met the guards halfway, getting eyed back just as much as they eyed the pair while they walked together to the gate.

“Rough year, the way your friends tell it,” the chatty one said.

“You could say that,” Tristan easily replied. “Seen a few, have you?”

The man snorted, his smile never showing his teeth.

“You don’t need to be cagey, the others already told us you don’t know shit about the Trial of Weeds,” he said. “This town is called Cantica. We’re a colony under the auspices of the Watch and your last stop before the final trial.”

“We’ll be getting an explanation, then?” Yong asked.

The guard shrugged.

“The mayor will tell you everything there is to know,” he said. “Most of us don’t know the details.”

The guards slowed when they came near the gates, which had the three tensing up again.

“While inside Cantica,” the chatty man said, “there is to be no violence against trial-takers or our folk. We won’t have our town to be the pissing match for maze grudges. Understood?”

“Understood,” Tristan agreed, and the others echoed him.

Twenty more feet had them past the gates, which the guards stayed behind to pull closed as they were ushered on. The destination was obvious: there was a crowd gathered in the street, but not of townsfolk. The survivors of the Bluebell stood before a hard-faced man in neat clothes that must be the mayor. There were fewer survivors than Tristan would have thought, and at least one of those present to the thief as a surprise.

Smiling insolently in the face of Angharad Tredegar dark’s glare, Augusto Cerdan toyed with the hilt of the sword he’d taken from a cultist.

This, Tristan thought, was going to get messy.

# Chapter 40

“Gods be my witness,” Mayor Crespin harshly said, “but if I either of you draws a sword I will have you shot.”

Angharad’s lips thinned, back straightening as she glared down at the man. She had already given her oath, what manner of honorless cur did he take her for? Cantica’s mayor, a middle-aged man with a bushy black beard whose wildness contrasted with the tidiness of his dated woolen green tunic, looked unimpressed by her anger.

“Glare all you want, girl, but I’ve permission from the commander in Three Pines to dispose of any of you who get rowdy,” the man said. “You think you’re the first kids with chips on your shoulders who’ve blown through here?”

“I have no intention of breaking my word,” Angharad curtly said.

Crespin held her gaze a moment longer – how flat they looked, she thought, almost lifeless – before grunting in what could have been either approval or dismissal. The mayor’s dark eyes then moved to Augusto Cerdan, who was yet grinning.

“I only reached for my blade because I felt in danger, good sir,” Augusto said. “I would not dare to break your laws.”

Mayor Crispin eyed the infanzon a moment longer.

“You’re lucky we don’t give out beatings for smugness,” the mayor finally said. “Go stand with the rest.”

That wiped the grin off Augusto’s face well enough. The mayor, stroking his beard, glanced at them one last time then peeled away. The two town guards that had been looming over their discussion leaned their muskets back against their shoulders. Men with much nerve, the Pereduri thought. There were only a handful of them, to pen in five times as many trial-takers, but at no point had they shown fear at the possibility of a fight breaking out.

Angharad supposed that living on this nightmare of a place must do wonders for building one’s bravery.

“You, the new arrivals,” Mayor Crispin called out. “Send me one in front. The remainder goes with the crowd.”

The dark-skinned noblewoman turned in surprise: she’d not noticed anyone coming. Angharad let out a startled noise at what she found: Tristan, Yong and the pale-skinned Sarai. The latter looked like she had done best of the three, at least until Angharad noticed the missing fingers. The others looked like they had been savagely beaten and Yong had clearly been shot but the three were well enough to move. They were warmly welcomed by the rest of their company, Yong more so than the rest – his acquaintance with Lady Ferranda and Lord Zenzele was of long date.

It was Tristan who limped to the front as they had been instructed, the sole part of him that did not look like it had been tossed down a mountainside the worn leather tricorn on his head. The Sacromontan had decent taste in that regard, at least.

“Tredegar,” the grey-eyed man tiredly greeted her, offering a nod.

“Tristan,” she happily replied. “I am pleased you made it through.”

How he had done so was a question for later, she decided. There must have been another path through the maze, one that could be pried open without ten victors.

“You can have your reunion later,” Mayor Crespin said, brusque but not unkind. “Tristan, is it?”

“That is my name,” the Sacromontan agreed.

“Should we be expecting further survivors?” the man asked. “The girl here says all the people she ran the second trial with are accounted for.”

“Our fourth is dead,” Tristan replied, face subtly tightening. “As far as I know, there are no others left.”

Angharad could not, in that moment, recall the old man’s name. Franco, Frecho? She had been told it at some point, she knew, and a slight well of shame came at the realization she had not cared enough to remember.

“Good,” Mayor Crespin said, then paused.

Tristan was looking at him. The grey stare was even, almost mild, but Angharad shifted uncomfortably at the sight. It was an unsettling sort of calm – the kind that came right before someone smashed a glass against your head or bared a knife.

“Not good,” Crespin corrected, “but simpler for us. If everyone is there we can get the Trial of Weeds going.”

Tristan cocked his head to the side.

“Do you need anything else of me?” he asked.

“No,” the mayor grunted, then flicked a glance her way. “Same with you, Malani. You can join the others.”

Angharad smoothed away her irritation at the inaccuracy and inclined her head in acknowledgement, keeping the other trial-taker company on the short walk. No words were shared, the only sound their boots squelching in the shallow mud. Song was waiting for Angharad when she returned, gesturing for her to come closer while Tristan disappeared into the crowd.

“Shalini gave them Ishaan’s body,” the Tianxi whispered in her ear. “They’ll burn it tomorrow, after firewood has been gathered.”

“She agreed to part with it?” Angharad whispered back, honestly surprised.

“They didn’t give her a choice,” Song replied. “They wouldn’t allow a corpse to be dragged around for fear of disease.”

Which was, the Pereduri admitted, a fair concern. Having her hand forced in such a manner explained why the Someshwari looked in a foul mood, however, ignoring Zenzele’s attempts to engage her in conversation. Ferranda stood with them, the trifecta having kept together on the march, and Angharad felt a pang of envy. Everyone she had passed the first trial with was now dead or estranged, save for Song – even Brun, who she thought herself on good terms with, now preferred to stand with Yaretzi and quietly converse rather than renew their acquaintance. Mayor Crispin cleared his throat, putting an end to the small talk, and all eyes went to him.

“First off,” the bearded man said, “since I heard the sanctuary got buried I’ll first ask you this: is there anyone here who would withdraw from the trials?”

He waited for a moment, to utter silence.

“Last chance,” he said. “If you get to hear the rules of the Trial of Weeds, the only ways you’re leaving this island are in a coffin or a black cloak.”

Still silence. The man shrugged.

“Don’t say I didn’t warn you,” the mayor said. “Follow me, I’ll give you the rules once we get to the town square.”

It was not a particularly long walk, though the lackluster streets made it rather unpleasant. They stuck to the sides as much as possible, closer to the occasional wooden planks than the mud in the middle of streets. After four minutes of passing shops, houses and a large inn the mayor slowed as they reached their destination.

The square looked almost out of place given how cramped the rest of Cantica was, all pressed against the palisade walls with narrow streets and rough wooden houses. In contrast the town square was a wide and open space paved with thick square stones. Spread out across it, facing the center, were three large iron cages.  Each was taller than a man and long enough you would be able to walk inside.

Padlocks hung on their open doors.

There was a ripple of unease through their company, which Angharad would freely admit to sharing in. If there had been beasts in the cages they were now gone, and if they were meant for people then…

“Here we are,” Mayor Crespin said. “Come close now, and no chatting. I won’t be repeating myself if you miss anything.”

Dutifully, their company assembled at the edge of the paved square while the bearded mayor came to stand between the cages. Crespin spat to the side, into the mud.

“Now, the Watch is supposed to give you some spiel about the nature of the third trial before sending you off our way,” he said. “But I’m no watchman, and I’ve only heard bits and pieces of the speech over the years.”

He shrugged.

“So I’ll be giving you my own understanding of it instead.”

The bearded man swept through them with his gaze.

“The Trial of Lines is a test of skill,” he announced. “If you don’t have a plan or lick up to people who do, if you don’t have the training to make it to the sanctuary quietly or the strength to fight your way through, then you end up dead.”

Angharad winced at the bluntness of his words, but there was the ring of truth to them.

“Now the Trial of Ruins, it’s a pot,” Mayor Crespin said. “They throw you into the water and turn up the heat to see what you’ll do when it starts to boil: do you fuck over your allies, do you break or run or rise up to the occasion?”

Glances were sent this way and that at the man’s words. Tupoc only grinned at the unspoken accusations, entirely unruffled, and a flattering amount of looks went her way at the last part. Angharad straightened her back, allowing herself a sliver of pride.

It did not last.

“There’s not many of you this year,” the mayor bluntly said, “so you must not have been great swimmers.”

There was the ring of truth to that as well, Angharad thought. Near thrice their current number had walked out of the Bluebell.

“Now, the Trial of Weeds isn’t like the first two,” Mayor Crespin said. “If you got here, you’re good or you’re lucky: either way, the Rooks can use you.”

He smiled, just a shallow stretch of the lips that had precious little mirth to it.

“No, this place is about ripping out the weeds before they get into the Watch, so to speak, and the winnowing is left to your own hands.”

Another ripple of unease.

“We’re not going to put any you in these cages,” Crespin said. “You are.”

Few of them liked the sound of that.

“Tonight, in the time before you retire to your rooms, each of you will be taken aside asked to give three names,” the man said. “One for each person you think should be put in one of the cages. The three of you named the most times will then be escorted into their cage by the town guard come morning.”

Angharad frowned, then cleared her throat. It earned her an unfriendly look from Crespin.

“What happens should two of us be named an equal number of times?” she asked.

It would not matter unless the third position was the one shared, she thought, but should that happen it was possible a draw would need settling.

“You get to share the cage,” the mayor replied without batting an eye.

That was, Angharad silently conceded, callously fair.

“Come morning, you’ll gather up here again,” Mayor Crespin continued, “and after the chosen enter the cages then you get to vote on which of the three will die.”

“You can’t be serious,” Shalini replied. “You want us to kill each other?”

The man shrugged.

“You’ve already been killing each other, I imagine,” he said. “Now is when you call each other to account for it.”

He chuckled.

“I’ve seen the smile drop off the faces of all sorts of clever sorts, when it sunk it that they might have to pay for their bloody tricks after all,” Mayor Crespin said. “The way I see it, this test is for them. If you throw your allies to the wolves, well, you best be clever enough to talk them out of hanging you after.”

The mayor shrugged.

“What use would the Watch have for you otherwise?”

Half a dozen of them spoke up at the same time even as Angharad’s fingers tightened around the grip of her saber. This was madness, she thought, how could they be expected to – Mayor Crespin’s hand rose, and silence fell again. No one wanted to risk missing a piece of the rules.

“It doesn’t end there,” the bearded man said. “After that’s done, each of you will get asked a question in private: should another round be played?”

You could have heard a pin drop.

“All it takes is one yes,” Crespin said, “for there to be another.”

“That is absurd,” Augusto bit out. “How many of us will die for petty grudges?”

It was uncomfortable, Angharad thought, to be forced in a position where she agreed with the man.

“As many as you lot care to kill,” the mayor said, indifferent. “The Trial of Weeds ends when refusal of another round is unanimous. After that we’ll hand you fresh supplies and you get to toddle on north to Three Pines to join the Watch.”

Though Angharad could feel indignation about to erupt, their company held on to silence a little longer. Crespin liked toying with them. They proved right to, as the mayor chuckled a few heartbeats later.

“One last thing,” he said. “There’s one last rule, which is a secret you will have to find on your own. A way for someone in the cages not to die even if they get picked. Sniff around for it however you will, so long as you remember the rules: no violence against my folk, or each other.”

Mayor Crespin offered them a nod.

“That’s the whole of it,” he said. “My people will find you to ask the names, don’t try to go to sleep before you’re given leave.”

He walked right through their crowd, forcing them to part as if to make a point, and for a few heartbeats silence followed in his wake.

Then chaos came screaming out.

—

The first thing that happened was that Tupoc Xical walked away.

Without a word, ignoring the jeers from Ferranda and Zenzele. Angharad searched his face for fear as he walked past her, for regret, but found neither. He looked, to her dismay, thoughtful. He knows he is certain to be sent into a cage, she thought, so he is going on the hunt for the hidden rule that might save his life. He must have committed to that decision before the mayor was even done speaking. It was a tortured thing to admire Tupoc’s composure – he would not have needed to be composed, after all, were he not a feckless traitor.

Everything admirable about him was intertwined with the worst of traits. In a way his qualities made it easier to despise him, Angharad thought, for Tupoc was capable of acting with honor she he want to. He had the skill, the discernment.

It was a choice for him to be heinous.

“We should all agree now on who we send into the cages,” Yaretzi was saying. “The trial thrives on mistrust, should we simply be open with-”

“How would we know if someone’s lying?” Lan casually asked. “We’ll give our names in private, the mayor was clear about that.”

Yaretzi turned a gimlet eye on the older woman, Angharad only then noticing that one of her turquoise earrings was missing. It must have fallen during their flight to Cantica.

“Trust,” Yaretzi began, but derisive laughter cut the sentence short.

“There is still a murderer among us,” Zenzele, who’d been the one to laugh, cut in. “There should be no talk of trust, Yaretzi.”

“Chaos is to no one’s advantage,” Song opined. “Some semblance of an agreement can only help.”

“You sit on more secrets than anyone here, Tianxi, and some are fresher than others,” Zenzele Duma flatly said. “I will not invade your privacy by pressing, but do refrain from taking us for fools. I will not be a tool for your schemes.”

Song met his eyes with her unblinking silver gaze, face hardening.

Angharad’s brow rose at the tension. That was a strong claim, but a lord of Malan had spoken it so he must not believe it a lie. And he has a contract that would let him sniff out secrets, she thought. Zenzele had seen her own vengeful oath, though he had not known what it was. And now he says that what Song keeps to herself dwarfs even that. A sobering thought. Yet secrecy was not deserving a scorn: had Angharad told them all she was pursued by assassins?  No, not even when she had foolishly feared that Zenzele Duma and his lover might be killers sent by her nameless foe.

“There is ruin in all our wakes, Lord Zenzele,” Angharad said. “To chase each other’s shadows is a game without a victor.”

The dark-skinned noble – taller than her even with his hat in hand, though not by much – fixed her with a steady look. Ferranda elbowed him, after which he gave Angharad a curt nod and wrenched his gaze away. Song looked about ready to speak again, but it was another who stepped in first. Master Cozme Aflor’s flair had never quite recovered from the loss of his hat, but the older man still cut a respectable figure with his finely groomed mustache and beard. The cuts he’d suffered on the Toll Road only added to it, the bandages around his arm lending him a wounded veteran’s look.

It was with his hand on the pommel of sword – loosely, resting and not threatening – that he went to stand before everyone.

“I have made mistakes,” Cozme Aflor bluntly said. “I own that.”

A burst of shrill, mocking laughter.

“Oh, sweet Manes,” Augusto Cerdan said. “To think I’d see the day where you bent that stiff neck enough to beg for your life, Cozme. The voyage was worth it just for that.”

The older man glanced at him with distaste, then ignored him.

“I tried to keep my oaths to House Cerdan beyond what was wise,” Cozme said, “but never did I bare a blade on any of you, or take revenge for a contract being used on me without provocation.”

A meaningful look was thrown at Shalini there, who sneered back.

“If you feel it has grown cold outside, then you should have thought twice before walking out,” the Someshwari replied.

Brun cleared his throat.

“One does not lightly leave the service of the infanzones,” the fair-haired man said. “Defiance is not without costs for Sacromontans, Shalini Goel.”

The short Someshwari eyed him with surprise, and some abashment at the reminder that she had come here as the close and trusted companion of a noble while Cozme was merely a retainer. Angharad, though she kept an eye on the talks, was instead taking measure inside her own mind. Tupoc was headed for a cage, that much was certain. He had made too many enemies. The only question worth asking was who else would be headed there.

“Let us not pretend being a soldier for a house right beneath the Six is the same as being a rat,” Tristan flatly said. “Pity is a fine thing, Brun, but Cozme Aflor never gave a shit about anyone but his charges until that bridge was thoroughly burned.”

“And he should be killed for that?” Brun challenged.

A harsh laugh.

“You will have to forgive Tristan,” Yong said. “He’s grown used to deciding who lives and dies.”

That earned the pair measuring looks – it was an obvious break in a previously cordial relationship – but Angharad was yet running down the list. No one, she thought, had made more foes than Augusto Cerdan and Cozme Aflor. It was near a sure thing that the two of them would be sent to the cages along with Tupoc. Only Yaretzi, who had fought Tupoc and been accused by Shalini, could even begin to come close.

“Everyone with a gun has that same power, Yong,” Lan blandly said, “and I see you carry two.”

“I don’t think this is going well for you, Cozme,” Augusto loudly whispered. “Perhaps you should… go with the current, old friend. It will be faster.”

Angharad almost winced – there was no almost about it for the older man – as she remembered when she had last heard that sentence.

“To consign someone to the cages does not mean death,” Angharad pointed out. “A mark of shame, perhaps, but not an oath to send them into the grave.”

“Well said,” Yong grunted. “I have been told I might be bleeding out, so I’m to look for a physician. I will, however, leave you with this: Tupoc, Augusto, Tristan. Make of it what you will.”

He began limping away after. Sarai, whose face was flushed pink with exhaustion, traded a look and a nod with Tristan before slipping away from the crowd to help Yong limp forward. The veteran looked as if he wanted to refuse, but after a moment conceded and slung an arm around her shoulder as they disappeared into the town.

“That was most unwarranted,” Augusto complained. “I’ve hardly even spoken with the man.”

“Hardly must have been enough,” Angharad evenly replied.

He cheerfully flipped her the finger, seeming unworried even though he was sure to be bound for a cage. Is this bluster, or is he genuinely without fear? Cozme, whose speech had been diverted by sundry distractions, cleared his throat and claimed attention once more.

“I have said my piece,” the older man said. “I can now only trust in the fairness of those assembled here.”

“I truly misspoke when I called you a cock,” Augusto mused. “How could you be such, when you have such a talent for fellatio?”

The infanzon chuckled.

“I trust in the fairness of those assembled here,” he repeated in a nasal voice. “At least get on your knees first, if you’re going to be working at it so hard.”

Cozme’s cheeks reddened in anger as he reached for his sword, not quite unsheathing it, and even Angharad felt her jaw tighten at the uncouthness of. Augusto had somehow become even more odious since the Toll Road, and no longer cared to keep his venom in check. By the looks on the face of those around here, that was doing him no favors. But then he would have been headed for a cage even if he turned sweet as honey, Angharad thought.

As Mayor Crespin had said, the Trial of Weeds was a reckoning for the other two.

“Talking here is pointless,” Shalini said. “Half of us can’t trust the other and there can be no serious talks with snakes coiled in our laps.”

“She’s right,” Lady Ferranda said. “And so was Yong, in his own way.

She paused.

“Tupoc, Augusto, Cozme.”

“I’ll be taking that up with the Villazur, when I return to the city,” Augusto mildly said.

The fair-haired infanzona cocked an eyebrow.

“That’d be quite a trick, without a head,” she said, and walked away.

Shalini went with her, and Zenzele flicked them a glance before clearing his throat.

“Consider Tupoc a given,” the Malani. “The rest bears thought.”

He then tipped his head at them politely and hurried to catch up after the others. There were still many of them left, Angharad saw. Of the fourteen they numbered there were still eight standing here in the square. But the moment Shalini and the other had left the prospect of keeping this out in the open had died. Even though there were numbers enough here to decide the matter if they wanted to, the illusion of unity had shattered.

Everyone would be cutting their own deals, as if this were the High Queen’s court.

Angharad met Song’s eyes and traded a small nod. They were done here, both agreed, and within a minute had taken their leave.

—

However cramped the planks on the side of the street, they were preferable to walking in the mud. Even if it made speaking as they moved somewhat awkward.

“I have a degree of acquaintance with Sarai,” Song told her. “I will seek her and find out what happened when our company and hers parted way.”

Angharad could read between the lines. The two women were acquainted, but the Triglau was less than fond of Malani. Understandable, if somewhat unwarranted – Angharad had never owned a slave nor traded in them. Their first conversation after the reveal of her origins had been… less than skillful, admittedly, so the Pereduri said nothing on the subject.

“I am rather curious what tunnel they found to escape,” Angharad admitted. “It must have been unknown even to the Watch.”

“They are a canny lot,” Song said. “I expect it will be an interesting tale.”

Angharad nodded, then cleared her throat awkwardly.

“I expect I should speak with Lord Zenzele first,” she said.

She delicately did not mention that her fellow islander had taken a clear dislike to Song. Said Tianxi eyed her from the side.

“He is not wrong,” the silver-eyed woman said. “I keep a great many secrets.”

“Your eyes bind you to such a fate,” Angharad shrugged.

It was, if anything, reassuring that Song was not prone to voicing the many hidden things that her eyes were certain to reveal by simple virtue of being in their presence. Angharad would much rather that pact be held by a woman inclined to secrecy than a blabbermouth. Song looked away, stepping through the shadow cast by the lamplights above.

“More than merely that kind,” she said. “I joined the trials on the Dominion for a particular purpose, Angharad, and thought I am yet bound not to speak of it the time approaches where I will be able to tell you.”

“That is not necessary,” Angharad assured her. “I do not begrudge silence, save if it causes harm.”

“It is necessary,” Song replied, sounding almost amused. “I intend to make you an offer when we reach Three Pines, and when I make it I would not have you think our entire acquaintance was a ploy.”

The Pereduri appreciated that, truly. All this scheming and lying, how exhausting it had become. Sifting through every sentence for ten meanings, every offered hand a trap. Even the closest to a pleasant diversion Angharad had found had been… Her jaw clenched at the memory of how Isabel and looked, her face a red ruin. Song’s open admission that she was keeping secrets and would offer a bargain was refreshing, a clearly drawn line in the sand.

She could do with more of those in her life.

“You have saved my life on more than one occasion,” Angharad said. “Whatever else may come to happen between us, Song, you may be assured that I will always hear out any offer you have to make.”

The other woman studied her for a stretching moment, steps stuttering on the planks, and it occurred to Angharad that Song was actually quite striking. Silver eyes set in a face of pale gold, the cut of her slender and elegant. Bearing a plaited braid and folded leather hat, she seemed almost like a huntress of story. A passing thought, almost absurd. No huntress out of a story would have been so intent on cutting her rations precisely that she ended up with leftover string-thin slices of bread that she never actually ate.

That and she snored, though the noise was amusingly dainty.

“Words worth remembering,” Song finally said.

They left it at that.

—

The inn they had walked past earlier was called the ‘Last Rest’.

The words were carved above the door in scrabbly Antigua, the townsfolk apparently being unacquainted with the notion of hanging a sign. If not for the large and open shutters she would not have known the place for what it was from the outside. The ground floor was a common room full of long tables, with a fireplace at the back and a bar counter. Behind that counter a door led into what looked like a kitchen, while a little to the side rickety stairs led to a second story.

Song had gone across the street, where the town physician and gravedigger – an efficient combination, Angharad had mused – was allegedly having a look at Yong’s wounds. Sarai would be waiting on him, as good a time as any to talk.

The three souls she had been on the hunt for, however, were in the Last Rest’s common room. Having claimed the end of the table near the fireplace, they were sitting with warm meals and what appeared to be tankards of ale. Moving their way, Angharad noted that while Shalini appeared to have claimed one of Zenzele’s sausages she had in exchange surrendered her beer. Ferranda had traded nothing, but was poking at her peas with a distinct like of enthusiasm. Angharad could not blame her, they were horribly common fare.

It was Ferranda Villazur who first saw her coming, and when Angharad gestured towards the open space by Zenzele’s side with a raised eyebrow the infanzona gave a shrugging nod. Permission enough, the noblewoman decided. Loosening her sword belt, she pulled it off and set it down to the side before sliding onto the bench by Lord Zenzele. The man in question swallowed his drink, then smiled her way.

“Lady Angharad,” he said. “Come to get a meal out of them as well?”

“I would not mind,” she admitted. “Is it expensive?”

She did not have much coin left, and to be honest the thought of coin had her a little dazed. How long had it been since she last paid for something? Not even two weeks, and yet it felt like an entire world away.

“No cost.”

Angharad tensed at the voice coming from behind: she had not heard someone approach. Turning, she found a startlingly young man that could not have been older than seventeen looking at her with mild boredom. He wore a leather apron over a roughspun brown cote – a long-sleeved tunic in an antiquated style – and his messy black hair went down to his shoulders. He must have been Lierganen, by the tan, but she could not place the accent.

“As part of our charter with the Watch,” the man said, “we provide room and board for all trial-takers as well as run the Trial of Weeds. You want a meal?”

Angharad slowly nodded.

“What is available?”

“The meal,” the man drily replied. “With or without beer.”

“It is barley beer, Tredegar,” Zenzele told her. “Criminal stuff.”

It did not seem to hinder him any from getting started on the second drink.

“Maize beer is a Malani obsession, Duma,” she amusedly replied. “My people make barley wine like civilized folk.”

“I’m sure you think you’re interesting,” the innkeeper said, sounding like they were anything but, “but I’m still waiting on an answer.”

Angharad asked for a meal, without ale, then cleared her throat.

“What is to be the arrangement for rooms?” she asked.

“Usually we split you lot between here and the Warm Coffin across town, but there’s barely any of you this year so you’re all going upstairs,” the man said, jutting his thumb towards the stairway near the counter. “Take whatever room you want, then come back and ask me for the key. There’s numbers on the doors.”

“Thank you,” Angharad nodded.

The man snorted, then walked away.

“I do not suppose the Warm Coffin’s owner would be any more polite?” she drily asked.

“It’s closed,” Shalini got out after swallowing a large mouthful. “Ferranda asked when we heard about the meal.”

“He seems young to run an inn,” Angharad said. “Even for a border town.”

“That we did not ask,” Ferranda replied. “Still, I would wager it had something to do with the cultists impaled before the gates. The entire town seems on edge, they might have been attacked recently.”

That made a great deal of sense, she thought. With the landslide burying the Watch garrison near the mountain, the cult of the Red Eye might have thought it opportune to try a raid on Cantica. It would also explain how few people they had seen out on the streets. The innkeeper was back with her meal: sausage, peas and sliced almonds. She thanked the man, asking for his name, and got a raised eyebrow as only response.

“Tried that too,” Zenzele drily said. “Not the friendliest of fellows, this one.”

Shalini, who had polished off her entire plate and had begun eyeing that of her neighbors, let out a grunt.

“He might not see the point in getting friendly when the trial could kill any of us,” the Someshwari said.

Ferranda discreetly used her wooden fork to empty most of her peas onto Shalini’s plate, smiling winningly at the other woman when Shalini turned to cock an eyebrow, but the grim mood brought on by the reminder of the Trial of Weeds was not so easily lifted.

“It is a bloody affair,” Angharad agreed.

“And it now brings you to our shores so you might know where who we will name,” Lord Zenzele said.

“That is of some import,” she said, “but my greater concern is to ascertain where we will stop.”

Looks of surprise.

“Barring a surprise or a miracle, Tupoc Xical will die come morning,” Angharad said. “My question to you is this: will the trial end there?”

The three traded looks, and again she felt a pang of envy at how closely they now kept. A few days ago they had been strangers.

“I had thought,” Zenzele slowly said, “that you would want a second round if only so that Lord Augusto might follow in Xical’s wake.”

Angharad shook her head.

“I can do my own killing,” she flatly replied. “I do not need a trial to do it for me.”

The oath she had given to Mayor Crespin was straightforward: she was to do no violence to trial-takers or the townsfolk while a guest in Cantica, unless attacked first. The moment they stepped out of the town the infanzon was no longer protected.

“That is,” Lady Ferranda hesitantly said, “to your honor.”

“You’re not the only one with grudges to settle, Tredegar,” Shalini said. “Putting Tupoc’s head on spike hardly needs selling and Augusto could do with getting his breathing rights revoked, but there’s a murderer still on the loose and I will see her face justice.”

Angharad stilled.

“Her?” she asked.

“Yaretzi tried to murder Ishaan on the way to the temple-fortress,” Shalini said. “You might not believe me, but I saw what I saw. I would have her put in a cage for it, then in a grave.”

“Do you have proof she murdered Jun and Aines?” Angharad asked.

“No,” Shalini admitted, “but how many vipers can there possibly be among us?”

Ferranda sighed.

“I do not agree, and did not vote accordingly,” the fair-haired woman said. “I am yet convinced that another was behind the deaths, acting through catspaws. I have heard… rumors about Yaretzi, however, that are suspicious.”

Isabel had said that ‘Yaretzi’ was a foot shorter than she was supposed to be. Ferranda did not seem to be putting strong stock in the other infanzona’s words, but neither was she dismissing them. Angharad cocked an eyebrow at Zenzele, leaving the question implied.

“Looking back, I find some of her behavior during the Trial of Lines unusual,” Zenzele admitted. “She was very used to roughing it, for a diplomat, and though she struck a friendship with Ayanda she showed little grief when the cultists took her.”

Shalini looked away at that. She and Ishaan had refused to pursue the warband to take back Zenzele’s lover, Angharad knew. It might have been the sounder call, but it seemed that a growing acquaintance with Zenzele Duma was shading the nuances of that decision in retrospect.

“You are both committed to pursuing Yaretzi’s execution through a second round, then?” she asked.

Shalini nodded briskly. Zenzele followed suit a heartbeat later.

“There will be a death every round, and three of us in cages on every instance,” she quietly reminded them. “You may not find the support you seek before a great many bodies have piled up.”

Ferranda hummed.

“A question best revisited tomorrow,” she said. “Once Tupoc is dead, we can decide how far this is to be pushed.”

Shalini looked mutinous but she kept silent. By unspoken accord they turned to lighter talk as Angharad went through her meal, wolfing down the bland fare. Hunger was the finest spice. Others drifted in as she did, alone or in pairs. Cozme, freshly bandaged, came over to the table to share with them the news that Yong was being cut open – he had a bullet in the back that must be removed – and might not be upright tomorrow. By the time Angharad finished her meal, the absences were more noticeable than those present. Besides Yong, only three were missing.

Tupoc, Lan and Augusto.

Parting ways with the three, Angharad grabbed her saber and went upstairs to pick a room. The stairs led up to a tiny hallway forming a broad L, she found, whose longer length faced the street. Between the two sides there were around twenty doors with a number painted and all were open save for the three nearest to the stairs. The Pereduri suspected these would be locked as well, but did not check. Instead she looked around for which room seemed most comfortable, hoping for a mattress that might not be stuffed straw. She was not the only one with such a notion.

“Comparing the rooms, are we?” Brun asked, lips twitching into a smile.

The blond Sacromontan looked tired, holding his pack loosely, but was still steady on his feet. That tended to be the way with him.

“Straw everywhere, so far,” Angharad admitted. “Have you found anything?”

“Same for the mattresses, I expect we should give up hope for that,” he said. “No windows anywhere, but the three rooms in the corner have a dresser as well as a bedside table. That appears the pinnacle of luxury around here.”

Angharad sighed. It was better than nothing, she supposed. The two of them trudged back past the stairs, turning the corner of the L into the smaller length of hall. While she hesitated Brun stole a march on her, claiming the middle of the three rooms and tossing his pack on the bed. Slightly irked, she walked past him and took the room at the very end of the hall. A twenty-one was painted in white on the door, the key she would need to claim.

Brun was waiting for her in the hall when she came out.

“Have you eaten yet?” he asked.

She nodded.

“Shame,” Brun said. “Was it any good?”

“Do you enjoy peas?” she drily asked.

“More than I enjoy starving,” the fair-haired man amusedly replied.

“Then I expect you will most adequately fed,” Angharad told him.

She could not bring herself to give a better compliment, as it would have been dangerously close to a lie. They made their way back down together, encountering Yaretzi going up as they did. Since the stairs were too narrow for two the Izcalli gallantly went back down to give way, while Brun instead climbed back up to cede her passage in turn. Angharad thanked the other woman with a nod, but no more than that. Given the chances that ‘Yaretzi’ was some kind of impostor, it was best to keep her distance.

When she claimed her key from the innkeeper, a dark-haired woman in her thirties – her clothes as old-fashioned as the young man’s – was waiting for her.

“Alix,” she introduced herself. “I handle Mayor Crespin’s affairs. You are Angharad Tredegar, correct?”

Angharad nodded confirmation.

“I need three names from you, then,” Alix said, picking up a chalk and slate.

After a heartbeat of hesitation, she gave them. Tupoc Xical, Augusto Cerdan and Cozme Aflor. After the first round  and Tupoc’s death Angharad saw no need to continue this vicious trial, but that was not in her power to decide. Perhaps talks could be had tomorrow, after the execution. After going back up to lock her door, when returning to the common room she found that Song was seated with Sarai and a reluctant-seeming Ferranda – something Angharad decided she wanted no part of. She took to the streets instead, feet itching to move for all her exhaustion.

They would not be allowed to retire to their rooms until all had given three names anyhow.

Cantica was smaller than she had thought. Two large inns, the Last Rest and the Warm Coffin, swallowed up quite a bit of the room inside the area walled in by the palisade and ring of lamplights. The rest was rough wooden houses – all their shutters were closed, and Angharad saw precious few of the townsfolk out on the streets – and a handful of shops. The people of Cantica were polite but distant, most of them not even bothering to reply to a greeting beside a curt nod.

The shops were not much to look at either. A half-empty general store and a smithy were nestled one against another, while further down the street a carpenter and a baker made up the rest of the town’s ‘main street’. Angharad found Lan sitting in the alley by the bakery, perched on a crate as she tore into a loaf of black bread. On a whim, she sought out the other woman.

“There are warm meals at the Last Rest, you know,” Angharad said.

The blue-lipped Tianxi smiled.

“You can’t move while eating those, though,” she said. “And there’s a lot to see in a place like this.”

Angharad cocked an eyebrow, somewhat skeptical.

“Is there?”

Lan hummed.

“How many people do you think live in a town this size?” she asked.

Angharad blinked.

“Around two or three hundred,” she guessed.

“Probably closer to four or five,” Lan said. “But you’re in the right area. How many of those people have you seen out in the streets?”

Angharad thought back, slipping into a frown.

“Fewer than fifty,” she said. “And no children.”

“Common sense to keep your kids indoors when you’ve got a dozen heavily armed lunatics on the prowl,” Lan said, “but why so few people are out and about is what has me curious. I figure it’s about the lights.”

The Pereduri blinked, putting the pieces together.

“You think hollows live here?” she asked, appalled.

“No,” Lan said, biting into the bread and swallowing a chunk. “I think people live here, and they keep hollow slaves. Do you know a lot of farmers who’d go out there and till a field when there’s cultists on the loose? They’re using expendables, is my guess. And the Watch allows it, because if Cantica’s turning a profit they can get some tax money out of this place.”

Angharad swallowed.

“And now that the lamplights are lit,” she said, “the hollows stay inside so the touch of the Glare will not hurt them.”

The other woman nodded.

“It’s just a guess,” Lan admitted. “But I find it mighty interesting there’s hardly a house in this town where the shutters are open but that all the shops – the rich parts, the people with coin – are open and their owners around. It paints a picture.”

It did, Angharad thought with a grimace. The Watch did not practice slavery, but Cantica was not the Rookery. It was a colony with a charter, and if the legalities were anything like those in Malan then this town would be something like a vassal state paying tribute. Not, strictly speaking, part of the Watch or its territories.

“Would that at least one part of this misbegotten island was not filled to the brim with sinister secrets,” Angharad bit out.

Lan eyed her, seemingly amused.

“Then you won’t be interested in what I overheard keeping an eye on our friend Augusto,” she teased..

Angharad blinked.

“Why were you following Augusto?” she slowly asked.

“Because Tupoc said he’d kill me and make it look like an accident,” Lan cheerfully replied. “I lost him two streets over, near the butcher’s shop.”

Angharad considered the other woman as she kept tearing into her loaf of bread, rather conflicted. On one hand, Lan was a sneak who looked into everyone’s private affairs and riffled through their bags when given half an excuse. On the other hand, she was so open about this and her generally mercenary nature that Angharad could not quite bring herself to actually consider her a sneak. If a viper told you it was a viper and that it was going to bite you, then proceeded to bite you in the exact way it had informed you it would, could it really be considered treachery?

Angharad cleared her throat.

“Please,” she said, “may I hear what Augusto was doing?”

If the other woman had brought it up, it would be worth hearing.

“Free of charge, since you’re a good sort,” Lan easily said. “Our boy was talking with the town guards earlier, asking about the gates of Cantica. More precisely whether there are other ways in or out of this place.”

Angharad’s eyes narrowed.

“Are there?”

“I didn’t hear the guard’s answer,” Lan said. “But I think his lordship has seen the writing on the wall for the Trial of Weeds, and now he wants to pull a runner before he ends up losing his head.”

That was, Angharad darkly thought, despicably plausible of the man.

“Perhaps I should have a look at where he is, then,” she flatly said.

“Good luck with that,” Lan said, biting into the bread. “And I mean it. You can smell the crazy on that boy, and it’s not even the entertaining kind.”

Not quite sure how to answer that, the noblewoman kept her face blank and offered her most polite goodbyes. Lan only seemed all the more amused, though her eyes were already far away.

The Tianxi was not done sniffing around Cantica for secrets, Angharad could tell.

—

She did not find Augusto in time.

The infanzon had made himself scarce, and Tupoc was no longer by the butcher shop when she passed close. In truth she did not have long to look around, as a town guard accosted her in the street and told her to return to the Last Rest.

“May I ask why?” Angharad politely said.

“The votes are all in,” the woman replied. “The names and numbers are on the slate by the door. Once everyone has seen them you’ll all be allowed to turn in for the night.”

Though Angharad believed she already knew the results, she supposed there was no harm in taking a look before going on the hunt for Augusto again. Besides, it might be interesting to see the numbers. She thanked the guard and briskly made her way back, finding most of their company out in the street and looking at a slate six feet high. The writing was the same as that of the mayor’s helper – Alix, was it?

Angharad stepped around Zenzele to come closer to the slate, noticing from the corner of her eye that Song was there and looking worried. Why? Her look at the slate revealed that eleven out of the fourteen of them had named Tupoc, putting him at the top of the list. It was, in truth, fewer than she had expected. Augusto was second and had been named ten times, which seemed reasonable to her. Cozme’s name was the third, she saw, but there she blinked.

Five times. He had only been named five times.

And the name under his was a scrawled ANGHARAD with a four besides it.

She had come within one vote of ending up in a cage, the Pereduri dimly realized. All this time speaking with others and never even noticed she was resting on the knife’s edge. Under her Tristan had been named four times as well, another injustice, and then of all people Brun had been thrice named. Yaretzi being named thrice was slightly less startling, but it came as a blindside that the last name on the list would be Song – named twice.

Perhaps Angharad should have tried to match votes to faces, to piece it all together, but her eyes kept returning to her name right under Cozme’s and how close she had come to being sent into the cage in his stead. Feeling stares lingering on her back, the Pereduri flushed in embarrassment.

Four votes, Sleeping God.

Augusto and Tupoc she could understand, but who else had she offended to deserve such a slight? Was Cozme two-faced enough to ask for her mercy and in the same breath try to have her encaged? The Pereduri’s jaw clenched. He likely was. And that still left one more among the fourteen who had wanted her put on display like a wild animal, having never said a word to her face.

Her mood significantly fouled, she ignored Song calling out for her and strode away. Absence of company would do her well. A minute or two of walking around with enough of a scowl that the townsfolk gave her a wide berth calmed her down, enough that when she caught sight of a familiar silhouette she did not avoid him. Tristan, after all, also had four votes to his name. She did not believe him any more deserving of such slander than she.

The scruffy man was leaning against the side of a house, Angharad saw as she approached, and looking up at one of the pale lamplights that ringed the entire town of Cantica to keep away lemures and strike fear in the hearts of darklings. The man flicked a glance her away as she came near, offering a polite nod that she returned.

“Missing home?” she asked. “It must have been quite the change, leaving Sacromonte for the first time.”

“There’s fewer lights in my parts of the city than you’d think,” Tristan replied. “But there is something nostalgic about this, I’ll admit.”

His lips thinned.

“These are the exact same kind of lamplights they use in the Murk.”

Angharad had not been long in Sacromonte, but long enough to hear of this Murk. The city’s slums, though there were wild and colorful rumors about what went on there. She cocked an eyebrow at the man, for this did not seem a detail worth staring at.

“I imagine they must import them from Sacromonte,” Angharad said. “It is the closest city to the island and the Watch has ancient ties to it.”

“I figured that as well,” Tristan agreed. “Only, Tredegar, those lamplights are in pristine state. Their glow is perfect.”

“And what does that mean?” Angharad asked.

“Either nothing at all,” Tristan quietly said, “or that we are in very serious trouble.”

# Chapter 41

It was a small mark, barely the width of half a palm, but that ‘C/C’ might just get them all killed.

“Trouble,” Lady Angharad Tredegar slowly repeated. “What do you mean?”

Tristan saw the change in the noblewoman, the way her previous sulk immediately turned into a straightened back as she unconsciously made enough room to be able to draw her saber. It was interesting that someone of her birth had learned such a habit – the kind you usually saw in legbreakers and killers who had been in the service of coteries for years, who knew death might come for them at any moment. Someone had tried to kill Angharad Tredegar, he figured, and taken more than one swing at it.

The thief cleared his throat.

“Would you like the short explanation or the long?” he asked.

The Pereduri blinked, as if surprised he would even ask.

“The long, of course,” Angharad seriously said.

“Huh,” Fortuna mused, cocking her head to the side. “No one ever asks for the long explanation. I think something might be wrong with her, Tristan.”

A beat.

“I mean, she just willingly signed up for you talking more to her, she must be a masochist at the very least.”

It was not possible to strangle an incorporeal goddess, Tristan knew. He had tried enough to be certain. Hiding his surprise – Fortuna wasn’t wrong about thew first part at least – the thief cleared his throat again, placing his thoughts in order.

“A lamplight is not a complicated thing to make,” he finally said. “In essence, it is an iron post about twenty feet high – broader at the base, for stability – with a cylinder of grass and iron screwed on atop it. There is an oil reservoir inside and a wick to light.”

Tredegar was, by all appearances, listening quite attentively. As if interested. It began to occur to him that Fortuna might actually be a right, an unsettling prospect at the best of times.

“The oil itself is cheap,” he said. “Almond oil, but they do not need to be Glare-grown – just cut with infused dust or stone. Iron is cheap in Sacromonte because of the Trench, and an iron post is not a complicated to forge, so lamplights are relatively cheap to make and have been for as long as anyone can remember. It is not a popular good to trade in because there is, as far as anyone can tell, no coin to make in it.”

“But,” Angharad said.

Malani nobles were said to have a better eye for coin than most, he recalled. Or at least their lesser branches.

“Enter Chabier Calante,” Tristan said, “to whom the very Prince of Lies is favorably compared in some parts of the Murk.”

The Pereduri’s brown eyes moved to the lamplight by which they stood, finding the ‘C/C’ impressed into the metal. Her brow rose.

“Decades have passed since then and tales have eaten away at the truth of the matter,” Tristan continued, “but some elements always remain: Chabier Calante was a trader, a Trebian merchantman, and by way of what he believed to be an opportunity came into a large number of Pili cannons – the barrels, to be precise.”

Angharad cocked her head to the side.

“I have read of those,” she said. “Tianxi artillery. Powerful but infamously imprecise. Their use cost the Republics several engagements at sea.”

“I doubt the man would have cared,” Tristan said. “But he was tricked anyhow: the reason he got the barrels so cheaply was because they had been miscast. Some sort of thinned junction, it made the bottoms prone to exploding after the second shot. Even worse, the republic he meant to sell these to averted war by way of treaty at the last moment.”

“So he was ruined,” Tredegar said.

She sounded rather approving.

“Most would have been, but Chabier Calante was bold,” Tristan replied. “Around that time, the City was looking to expand its lines of lamplights into the Murk. Chabier had a stroke of inspiration: by sticking the miscast barrels atop a shorter, hollow base of scrap iron, he would be able to build lamplights for a pittance.”

“Surely the quality would be greatly lessened,” Angharad frowned.

Tristan shrugged.

“The story goes that when the contract bids were made to the infanzones, his offered price was almost half that of his competitors,” the thief said. “Chabier’s description of his shorter, squat lamplights as ‘built hardened against the savagery of the commons’ was allegedly found rather charming. They awarded him the contract.”

The noblewoman’s face hardened.

“This borders on corruption,” she severely said. “It is, at the very least, incompetence.”

Tristan wondered what it must be like, to live in a world where either of these things were a real hindrance in holding onto power you were born to.

“Lamplights with that newly minted mark of ‘C/C’ sprouted over about half the Murk the following year,” Tristan said. “All of Soliante, Araturo and Careyar.”

“I do not know these districts,” Angharad told him. “I was lodged in Cortolo and spent some time in Fishmonger’s Quay.”

Tristan let out a little noise of curiosity.

“Cortolo’s one of the nicer parts of the Old Town,” he said. “I’m surprised you were able to get a bed there, most foreigners end up near the ports.”

“My uncle recommended an acquaintance,” Angharad said.

Ah, the blackcloak relation. More likely he had recommended an inn with ties to the Watch, Tristan thought.

“They are districts near the western edge of the city,” he said. “Far from Cortolo, and indeed the eyes of the infanzones. Chabier Calante became very rich from this deal, a man of means, but as the months turned into a year word began trickling in: his lamplights kept blowing up, the top exploding in showers of fire and broken glass.”

Angaharad’s lips thinned. She was, Tristan realized, genuinely angry at the thought of something that had happened in a foreign land decades before she was born.

“It was the parts from the Pili cannons,” Tristan said. “Constant heat warped them, and by doing so turned them into makeshift grenades that blew the top off their own lamplights.”

“What happened after Chabier Calante was arrested?” Tredegar asked.

“He wasn’t,” Tristan mildly said. “Chabier suppressed news a few more years by paying a coterie to frame another for the explosions, which kept him in good odor long enough to marry into a noble house and prepare.”

“Prepare how?” the Pereduri said, sounding baffled.

“By the time it came out his lamplights were essentially a self-inflicted bombardment of Sacromontan streets,” Tristan said, “he had replacements lined up for the pieces whose manufacture just so happened to enrich enough powerful infanzones that not only did he go unpunished, he actually grew richer.”

Angharad Tredegar looked as if she had just been slapped, something that took great effort not to smile at. He could not help it, she was taking it all so personally.

“He should have been hanged,” the noblewoman stiffly said. “And all involved in awarding him the contract stripped of their offices and titles in public disgrace.”

You don’t even notice it, do you? That even in your finer world, you would hang the commoner and let the nobles get away with a slap on the wrist. Tristan could not find it in him to be irked over it. It was the kind of blindness you were born into, as much a defect as a limp or a stutter. Tredegar looked slightly embarrassed by her own outburst, coughing awkwardly.

“This lamplight is one of the repaired pieces, then?” she asked.

Tristan grimaced, for now they got to the bone of it.

“Chabier’s name would not still be cursed for his trick after decades passed had it ended there,” he said. “The replacement pieces, you see, did not work all that well either. The glow of the lamplights tends to wax and wane, and some trouble with the wicks means they can go dark for hours at a time without warning.”

Tredegar was not a slow woman, for all her self-inflicted fettering.

“You said earlier that the glow of these lamplights is perfect,” Tredegar slowly said. “It is not the same as those you know, then?”

“No,” he grimly said. “It is not. The upper half does not look quite the same either, the mark is in a different place.”

He grimaced.

“I think,” Tristan said, “that we are looking at the originalcast. Chabier’s first batch.”

“And you said that within a year these pieces exploded,” Tredegar quietly said. “Those in the Murk were used every day?”

He nodded.

“Then even if the people of Cantica light these only the necessary amount to prevent Gloam disease, they should have broken by now,” Tredegar stated, and he was surprised by the certainty in her voice.

Ah, he should not have. Her mother had been some sort of explorer, hadn’t she? No one knew Gloam disease better than those who ventured out into the dark seas.

“There could be other explanations,” he warned. “If the town has only existed for a year or two, for example.”

“It would not have become the crux of the Trial of Weeds were it so recent a creation,” Tredegar noted. “Nor would it have so many established trades on the main street.”

A fair point, he thought as she paused.

“Though I suppose they could have private sources of Glare light,” she said. “Within their own homes. It might be that the use of the lamplights is restricted to the Trial of Weeds.”

“The lamplights are half of what keeps out cultists and lemures,” Tristan disagreed. “The Watch does not seem to be protecting Cantica from raids, by the corpses out front, so they would have used them defensively at least. Besides, think of the costs. Every single family in a small town like this having a private light? It would represent a fortune in coin.”

And Cantica did not seem like a wealthy town.

“I have no notion of the costs involved,” Tredegar admitted. “Much of Peredur is covered by Glare light from the pit above.”

“It’d be cheaper near a pit, like your home or Sacromonte,” Tristan said, “but it would be quite expensive out here on a nowhere island, where all is imported. I doubt even the Watch garrisons on the Dominion have such luxury.”

“Then the people of Cantica ought to be darklings by now, and they are not,” the Pereduri said, her voice gone flinty. “They are hiding something from us.”

It was interesting to witness it, the exact moment when white turned to black in Angharad Tredegar’s mind. Before then the townsfolk had been their hosts, honorable souls deserving of every courtesy. Now they were schemers, looming threats. It would have been easy to mock the woman for it, call it simplicity, but Tristan had seen naivete and this was not it. It was trained mindset, something she had been taught.

Would it not be a useful skill to a noble, being able to decide in a heartbeat that one of your formerly esteemed peers was a hateful foe without taking the betrayal personally?

He was coming around to thinking that Angharad Tredegar was a lot like a thoroughbred trained for the races. Splendid at what she was meant to do – swording people and being mannerly – but somewhat at a loss outside these bounds. Which was only natural: using a racer like a mountain mule was a good way to scrap that very expensive horse. Besides, Tredegar would not be at a loss forever. She was not without cleverness, given time to find her footing she should turn into a singularly dangerous woman.

But for now she was merely very dangerous, so the thief intended to find her a racing course to put that danger to use. What to say, what to hide, what to leverage? Tristan sketched out the angles, then made his decision.

“This cannot be spread around blindly,” Tristan told her. “Some would panic and tip off the townsfolk we are onto them.”

“If we are in danger,” Tredegar said, “we must warn the others.”

The thief feigned hesitation, preparing to concede down to the compromise he had wanted from the start.

“Only those we both agree on,” he offered.

After a heartbeat of hesitation Tredegar nodded. It would serve, given the Malani obsession with keeping their word.

“We need to find out what they are hiding,” the noblewoman said. “What kind of dark pact has kept them from becoming hollows without Glare light.”

“I have a guess as to what might be going on,” Tristan said. “But considering who I believe has the answers, I will need your help.”

Tredegar cocked an eyebrow.

“My help?” she skeptically asked.

He nodded.

“We need to find Tupoc,” Tristan said.

“He despises me,” the noblewoman informed him. “An entirely mutual feeling, I assure you.”

The thief doubted that, in fact – at least on the Izcalli’s side – but now was not the time for that talk. Or ever, really.

“It doesn’t matter,” Tristan said. “Tupoc Xical is not going to answer any question I ask him, because he and I both know that if I press him he will savagely beat me and dump my unconscious body somewhere humiliating.”

Tredegar opened her mouth and then closed it, speechless..

“You, on the other hand,” Tristan continued, “can savagely beat him should he attempt this, which he is equally aware of. That capacity is the required foundation for having any kind of halfway polite conversation with Tupoc Xical.”

The noblewoman squinted at him.

“Tristan,” she said, “are you attempting to use me as some sort of street tough?”

That was absolutely what he was attempting to do, yes. Outright lying to the woman whose entire way of life was bound to the concept of honor seemed a mistake, so he decided on a different angle.

“Be a pal,” Tristan tried. “Do it for justice.”

A heartbeat passed.

“I am not sure whether I should be offended at the implication,” Tredegar muttered, “or relieved that someone is finally asking of me something I know for certain I can do.”

“That uncertainty,” he sagely advised, “is the garden where friendships bloom.”

Angharad did not stab him for that, which was good as agreement in his book.

—

Tupoc Xical, spear assembled and at the ready, loomed over them from the rooftop.

The pale-eyed Izcalli was perched at the edge of the tiles, surveying the streets of Cantica like a hunting cat waiting for the right prey to pounce. Tupoc was bound for the cages and likely the grave unless he found the secret that would spare his life, so it hardly surprised Tristan that the man had decided trying to rustle up votes was a waste of time better spent on getting the lay of the land in Cantica. Indeed, the thief was counting on it. Everyone else, including him, had dabbled elsewhere.

“Good evening,” Tristan cheerfully called out.

The Izcalli sneered down.

“Less so now that you waste part of it,” he said. “Run along, rat.”

A full two seconds passed.

“Lady Tredegar,” Tupoc greeted with a nod.

It was almost impressive how excruciatingly deliberate he had made that pause.

“Your manners are lacking as ever,” Tredegar frostily replied.

“They match the soul they are offered to,” Tupoc drawled.

Insult and compliment all at once, Tristan thought amusedly. How crafty.

“We ask only for a conversation,” the thief said.

“We?” the Izcalli snorted. “How the mighty have fallen, Tredegar. Are you now cowering away in fear of the dark with this one?”

Angharad Tredegar cocked her head to the side.

“Shall we,” she mildly said, “speak of fear, then, Tupoc Xical?”

The eerily perfect man went still, a statue of flesh and blood, and Tristan hid his surprise. Tredegar had something on the man, she must have for him to react this way. How? Nobody had something on Tupoc, the Leopard Society man was like a pile of razor blades fashioned into a man’s shape. Tupoc leapt down from the roof, landing in a smooth crouch that was just close enough to force Tristan to take a step back, but the thief hardly even cared. This was just too delicious.

That Angharad Tredegar, of all people, would come into the power to hold Tupoc’s feet to the fire was enough to make his day.

“Do not waste my time,” Tupoc said. “What do you want?”

Tredegar cleared her throat, turning her gaze to Tristan. This had gone remarkably quickly, the thief mused, and he had not had to suffer nearly as many condescending threats against his life as he had been expecting.

Angharad was already proving a remarkably useful stick to shake at people.

“To trade in secrets,” Tristan said. “You have been looking over Cantica for hours now, Xical. Where is it?”

The noblewoman at his side frowned.

“Where is what?”

Tupoc snorted.

“The place where the bodies are buried,” the Izcalli said. “Where our beloved hosts are keeping their dirty little secrets.”

Tristan cocked an eyebrow.

“And?”

“On the right side of town, near the palisade, they keep large piles of lumber for firewood,” Tupoc said. “Only the wood is old while the tracks that come and go in the mud are fresh.”

“So and underground cellar, most likely,” the thief mused. “They are keeping something down there.”

Tredegar looked uncomfortable.

“I have been told,” she hesitantly said, “that Cantica might be keeping darkling slaves. If such a cellar exists, it might be a gaol of sorts for the disobedient.”

Tristan stilled for a moment, fitting the pieces. If his growing guess about what the people of Cantica actually were proved true, then it was only sensible that hollow slaves would be kept around to work the fields and do the busywork. He had thought that the streets were empty because the townsfolk were keeping away from the trials, but Glare lamplights would force hollows off the streets.

“That would be a boon,” Tupoc said. “Tortured slaves always tell on the masters when given the opportunity, hollows most of all.”

Tredegar, he saw, was struggling between a polite dislike of slavery and her inability to approve of a slave turning on their lawful superior.

“Time to have a look at thar cellar, then,” Tristan said, rolling a shoulder.

“Trade means I get something as well, rat,” Tupoc said.

The thief nodded.

“Your question?”

“No question,” Tupoc said. “I am coming with you, that is my price.”

“No,” Tredegar immediately denied.

Tristan said nothing, which after a heartbeat earned him a glare and a reproachful Tristan from the swordswoman. Mentioning that Tupoc seemed like a splendid scapegoat should anything go wrong with their little trip was unlikely to sway Tredegar, so instead Tristan tried a different approach.

“Why do you want to come?” he asked Tupoc. “You could easily trade for us telling you what we learn afterwards instead.”

The Izcalli’s pale eyes narrowed, a grudging look seizing his face. Tupoc recognized the offered branch for what it was – a way to talk himself into coming along – but resented being given at all anything by the likes of Tristan. This was turning, the thief mused, into a most satisfying interlude. Squirm some more, he thought, smiling pleasantly at the other man.

“This trial,” Tupoc said. “There is something wrong about it.”

“There is nothing wrong about being called to account for your own deeds,” Tredegar bit back.

He dismissed that with an irritated gesture.

“I mean in the way it is done,” the Izcalli said. “What prevents any group with half the votes from killing off everyone they dislike regardless of the stated purpose of this trial? It is supposed to weed out the unworthy but it is too easy to rig, even with a way to get out of being killed.”

“Ah,” Tristan exhaled. “You think there is something out to kills us beyond each other.”

“We are forbidden from fighting each other and the townsfolk,” Tupoc said. “But what if there was something else inside the walls with us?”

Something that could walk under the light of the Glare, something that would not reveal itself before it struck. Tristan had slowly but surely come to the same conclusion, but on a larger scale than Tupoc was considering. The Izcalli was yet thinking of this as a hunt when he should have thought of it as a racket.

“Attacks in the night would punish us for lingering too long,” Tredegar quietly said. “Force us to balance the righteousness of executing the deserving and the risks we incur to the innocent in doing so.”

Something the blackcloaks would be most interested in learning about their company before welcoming them into its ranks. Is the hidden rule that hunting the killer during the night gets you spared? It would be a way to preserve talent that had burned too many bridges but might still be useful to the Watch.

A rule to preserve the likes of Tupoc Xical, in other words.

“I want answers, same as you, but that is not why I want to go with you,” Tupoc said. “It occurs to me that my foe might just be tempted into an attack should it look like we are about to uncover Cantica’s secrets.”

Tredegar breathed out.

“That is what you have being doing,” she said. “Standing alone in an attempt to bait them out.”

Ah, Tristan thought. The blinders went both ways. He saw the affairs as a racket, so it had not occurred to him that Tupoc might be trying to outfox the hunter. It was good Tredegar had caught it, for it finally allowed him to understand what exactly it was the Izcalli had been doing all this time.

“He will coming along whether we like it or not,” Tristan told Angharad. “He is dead if he does not find the hidden rule, there is nothing we can do that will be worse than the outcome should he miss that opportunity.”

The noblewoman stared at him for a long moment, face reluctant, but he did not blink. Tredegar sighed.

“Though you will be accompanying us,” she flatly told Tupoc, “you will not be of our company.”

An important distinction to her, he expected. Perhaps she would not be bound to offer him aid in battle if he was not a ‘companion’.

“You are hurting my feelings, Lady Tredegar,” the Izcalli grinned.

“Count your blessings that an oath prevents me from hurting anything more than that, Xical,” she bit back.

And without another word she walked away, leaving the two of them standing face to face.

“Looking for fresh coattails to ride, Tristan?” Tupoc idly asked. “Yong seems to have finally shaken you off of his.”

“I am going to find out what she has on you, Tupoc,” Tristan affably replied, “and walk around this town shouting it at the top of my lungs.”

With the proper courtesies now observed, they hurried to catch up to Tredegar.

—

The piles of lumber were exactly as they had been told: large, old and much too frequently visited to truly be what they pretended to be.

The three were careful to avoid walking in the mud and leave tracks – rather, he and Tupoc were and Tredegar observed the same route without asking why – as they approached. The place was deserted, likely to avoid drawing attention in the first place, but they avoided staying out in the open anyhow. The faster they were done here the better. Though they swept around looking for the expected lookout, none was there to be found.

“We are taking too long,” Tupoc grunted. “Best we start looking for that cellar.”

The part where the lumber was stacked was dry ground, so tracks were not so easily found, but after they began going around testing them Tredegar soon let out a noise of surprise. Her stack was easily moved, lifted one-handed, and though the Pereduri was a strong woman she was not that strong.

It was hollow, glued together, and there was a trap door beneath.

“Promising,” Tristan said.

They moved aside the false pile. Tupoc tried to prevent it from being too obvious they had moved it from a distance, but Tristan suspected that was a lost cause. Secrecy would only be had by speed. Pulling at an iron ring, Tredegar opened the door and revealed a lightless stone chamber below. Tristan knelt at the edge, peering down, and frowned. The stink of human filth was strong, but he saw little aside from bare stone.

“We will have to go down,” he said. “I do not suppose either of you has a lantern?”

“Matches,” Tupoc replied.

It would have to do. There was a small makeshift ladder leading down and down they went one after another, the Izcalli taking the lead. Once Tredegar closed the trapdoor over their heads, Tupoc scratched a match. Flickering light revealed the boundaries of the small chamber they were in: stone on all sides except one, where instead a door of thick iron bars faced them.

“You were right,” Tristan murmured to Angharad. “It is a gaol.”

There was a padlock on the door, the same kind as the cages in the town square, and as they got close the match guttered out. Tupoc scratched another, revealing the dozen darklings laying down on a floor covered by filthy straw and dust. Most were half-naked, all bruised and several look like they had been cut. Or clawed at. Tredegar went stiff with outrage, Tupoc remaining unbothered. Tristan instead studied the prisoners inside, finding that thought most were either asleep or unconscious one woman in rags was look at them with wide eyes.

Blue eyes, he saw, and the sight of that with pale skin had his belly clenching with something unpleasant.

“You’re not them,” the woman rasped out in accented Antigua.

“The townsfolk of Cantica,” Tristan said. “They are the ones who put you here?”

She feebly nodded.

“Masters,” she said. “I took more rations, for my brother, and they said I am a thief. Put me here.”

“You are a slave, then,” Tupoc said.

His voice was soft, almost gentle. His match died and he struck another, revealing that his pale eyes were as cold as they’d ever been. A Leopard Society man at work, the thief thought.

“All slaves,” the woman said. “We work fields. Cut wood. Serve.”

“The lamplights,” Tristan said. “How often are they lit?”

The woman coughed, rasped out that she did not understand. Tredegar’s face was a painting of anguish. Tupoc spoke a few words in a language Tristan did not know – a hollow cant? – and then repeated the second part of the thief’s question.

“Once a year,” the woman said. “A few days.”

She coughed again.

“Can you,” she began, licking her lips. “Can you let me out?”

“As soon as we have the key,” Tupoc lied without batting an eye. “Do you know why the townsfolk have not become like you? Why they are still of the Glare?”

The slave shook her head, then hesitated.

“This place,” she said. “Those who come here do not come back. Maybe this. Please, won’t you let me out?”

Pity was never any help, Tristan knew. It was best set aside.

“There are stories of Triglau tribesmen sacrificing men to gods so they might avoid going hollow,” Angharad quietly said.

He traded a skeptical look with the Izcalli before the match went out, another scratched into life. Malani sailors had many a wild tale about the folks of their far-flung territories – always spoken of as a tale told them, of course, to avoid lying.

“The town might have something like a candle,” Tupoc said. “It would not support many without regular blooding, but that might explain why we have seen so few townsfolk.”

We have seen few townsfolk, Tristan thought, because this is not a town. Not anymore than this gaol is a gaol: it is, in truth, a larder.

“We need to leave,” the thief said. “We have been down here too long and she has nothing more to tell us.”

Tupoc nodded. Tredegar looked torn, but there was a reason the Pereduri had said precious little since coming down here. She knew she was in no place to make promises.

“Please,” the woman rasped, crawling their way. “Please.”

Tristan wrenched his gaze away. Tupoc was the last one up, as he had to keep scratching matches, and that was a mercy.

He was the only one of them those hoarse pleas were not making flinch.

—

Tristan had half-expected an ambush the moment they were back to standing among the lumber piles, but there was not a soul in sight. Not even a rat. The thief hummed, trying to remember if he had seen any animal at all since coming to Cantica. Not one, he thought. Not a single cat or dog, much less a rat. There would be cattle somewhere, for there was a butcher’s shop near the main street, but the lack of anything else was telling.

It went on the tally, along with the way the townsfolk never showed their teeth when smiling and kept conversations short – when they could not avoid talking entirely.

“We should split up,” Tristan suggested. “If we stay together people will ask where we have been.”

Tupoc gave no argument, as was only to be expected. Half the reason the Izcalli had come was because he’d wanted to be attacked, he would not insist on sticking together. Tredegar hesitated, still shaken by what she had seen below, but nodded after a moment.

“Let us meet again at the Last Rest,” she told him. “We must talk.”

Tupoc snorted dismissively at them and stalked away, disappearing into the bowels of the town. Tristan nodded his agreement at the noblewoman, then invited her to head out first. He waited until she had turned the corner to follow suit, every second growing tenser. He was the easiest prey of the three, he knew, and if someone was lying in wait… Only when he sped away from the hidden cellar after having put the hollow pile back in place there was no sudden attack. There was, indeed, no trace of anyone at all until he was close to the main street again.

There he ran into a couple out on a walk, the both of them silently nodding back when he gave a cheerful greeting.

“Not a chatty folk, are they?”

He almost leapt out of his skin. Maryam was sitting on a small bench by the side of the road, tucked away into a slice of shadow as she looked on. He had missed her entirely, which did nothing for his nerves. Calm, he told himself. You have already discovered part of the trap.

“That they are not,” he said.

She moved over to make room for him when he approached, sitting by her side almost close enough to touch. Tristan hesitated a bit, then bit the blade.

“How is he?”

Maryam grimaced.

“His chances are half and half, the physician says,” she replied.

Tristan grimaced back. Not only because Yong’s life was now a coin flip but also because he was no longer certain that the physician could be trusted to speak the truth in the first place.

“We have trouble,” Tristan said.

Blue eyes narrowed at him. He swallowed, remembering the pleas that had followed them up the ladder before trailing off into a ragged silence just as heartbreaking.

“Once, just once, I would like to have a light-hearted conversation with you,” Maryam demanded. “How goes it, Maryam, lovely weather we’re having isn’t it?”

“Delightful,” he replied, unable to follow her mood. “Cloudy with a chance of devils, you might say.”

She stilled; all humor stolen right out of her.

“Inside the walls?” Maryam whispered, leaning closer.

“I think every single person we’ve talked to since arriving in Cantica has been a devil,” Tristan said, and it was almost a relief to finally say it out loud. “They all smile without showing their teeth and a many of them avoid actually talking.”

Not all devils were skilled at mimicking voices, their kind growing more adept at deception as they aged.

“It’s the eyes that give them away, usually,” Maryam contested.

It was. Eyes were fragile, especially when you emptied out the body behind them to wear it over your misbegotten form, so they tended to dry out our rip. In modern times devils were said to wear spectacles over them to hide the detail, but half of Cantica wearing these would have been a dead giveaway.

“I was taught to check the teeth,” Tristan replied. “The careful ones keep the human teeth, but if you look deep enough you can see their own creeping up behind.”

He had never seen the true body of a devil with his own eyes, though he had seen diagrams in books. Something neither quite crustacean nor insectile but every inch a nightmare, all chitin and pincers. They had to fold themselves very carefully to fit inside a carcass, and should they lose their temper they were apt to rip through the fragile shell allowing them to walk around under Glare light. Maryam shivered.

“If the Watch allowed them to settle here, they should be signatories of the Iscariot Accords,” she said.

Relatively few things had been asked of Hell’s regents, when peace was made and the Accords signed. The two large concessions had been the sealing of Pandemonium – the birthplace of devils – and that their kind would cease to eat humans and wear their skin. Modern devils, those that some nations allowed within their borders, wore skin taken from corpses. Fresh corpses, so the shell had not decayed, but they took only from the already dead.

The devils here should not be meaning to eat them, Maryam meant.

“I’m guessing they eat whichever poor bastard in a cage gets picked to die,” Tristan mildly said. “They would need the bodies to replace the shells that rot or get torn, anyhow.”

Shalini had been promised that Ishaan would get burned, but he now had some doubts. More likely something would get burnt, and next year Ishaan Nair would be one of the faces greeting whoever made it to the Trial of Weeds.

“The man running the Last Rest is very young,” Maryam said after a moment. “Doesn’t even look twenty. If that was a choice made because they only have so many shells to pick from…”

“Then they are not given free rein to devour us at will,” Tristan slowly finished. “That is something, at least.”

“But not much. We need a way out of this place if it all goes to – well, you know,” she embarrassedly finished.

Hell, he amusedly realized she had been going to say.

“I expect there is more than a single way out of this place,” he said. “A town of this size cannot do with a single gate.”

She nodded.

“Find it,” Maryam said. “I need to warn someone meanwhile.”

Song Ren, he thought.

“I am to meet with Tredegar at the Last Rest in a while,” he said. “To discuss plans.”

“I will be there,” Maryam said. “And see if you can find Lan before joining us, she was looking for you earlier.”

It was his turn to nod. Lan had sharp eyes, he would not be surprised if she had noticed something stank about Cantica. And someone had warned Tredegar about the likely slavery, hadn’t they? That rather sounded like the dealer buying herself a friendly mirror-dancer. Tristan suddenly hesitated, Maryam cocking an eyebrow.

“Out with it,” she asked.

“There are slaves here,” he said. “I found an underground gaol with Tredegar and Tupoc, it is how I put the last details together.”

That the prisoners in that gaol never returned because the devils ate them. Maryam sighed, passing a hand through her hair.

“There are slaves in many places, Tristan,” she said. “My own father kept several. You need not tread so lightly about it.”

Tristan almost told her she would not say as much if she had seen how the slaves in the gaol were treated, but he bit his tongue. Maryam had seen more of Vesper than he had. They had never said as much, but they both knew this. She knew full well the ugliness of slavery. It had been him that was unprepared: it was one thing to know of the hollows in the Trench, how they were treated no better than beast of burdens, but another to see such a thing with his own eyes.

“It is a foul thing,” he finally said, exhausted.

“And fouler yet when made into a trade,” Maryam softly agreed.

Neither said any more than that.

—

Lan was hanging around the slate where all the names and numbers had been writ in chalk, staring at them in what Tristan suspected was an attempt at figuring out who had tried to put who in a cage. The thief himself was rather curious who had named him, but he had significantly larger swords hanging above his head at the moment.

“Tristan,” his fellow rat greeted him without turning. “What have you been up to, I wonder?”

“Seeing the sights,” he drawled. “You?”

Lan eyed their surroundings. No one was all that close, most the others inside the Last Rest to eat or drink, but the shutters were open and sound might carry. She gestured for him to follow, the two of them moving into the alley to the side of the inn.

“Brun is up to something,” she said, lowering her voice. “And I think Yaretzi is part of it.”

The thief eyed her.

“I’m listening,” he said.

“They’re always talking,” she said. “And they have the two rooms besides Tredegar’s.”

“He has no reason to go after Tredegar,” Tristan pointed out. “Not only would she promptly kill him for it, she has a high opinion of the man and people listen to her.”

“Maybe it’s about Yaretzi, then,” Lan impatiently said. “They’re up to something, Tristan.”

The thief grimaced.

“I still believe Brun is the killer,” he finally said. “No one else fits. But I think I might have been more certain in the moment than was truly warranted, Lan.”

She eyed him coldly.

“You don’t really think that,” the blue-lipped woman said. “You just think this is too much trouble to deal with on top of whatever you disappeared to sniff out.”

That was, he silently conceded, not entirely unfair of her to say. It certainly weighed on the scales – Brun was something to deal with when the threat of devils was no longer hanging over their heads. But it was not a lie either to say that he had thought twice since threatening the other rat.

“Even if he was out to kill someone again,” Tristan said, “why would Yaretzi help him?”

Lan hesitated.

“What else would they be doing?”

“An alliance, for fear of ending up in a cage,” he said. “Or dead.”

The thief shook his head.

“Bring me more,” Tristan said, “and it could be acted on. But you don’t have enough, Lan.”

And however sharp her eyes, he thought, wanting her twin’s killer dead was not like to keep them clear. Lan licked her lips, the blue on her tongue faded darker, and scoffed. She stalked away angrily, but they both knew that for the concession it was. Tristan watched her go and sighed.

He had a gate to find.

—

To his utter lack of surprise, when Tristan slid into a seat across the table from Angharad Tredegar her minder was at her side. Song studied him calmly with those unblinking silver eyes, weighing and taking his measure. The thief wondered if Maryam, who was sitting on his side of the table, was to be taken as his minder.

There might even be a grain of truth to that.

“We must decide on what we tell others,” Song Ren evenly said. “And do it soon, as people have already begun to retire to their rooms.”

Tristan glanced at Maryam, wondering exactly how much of their own path to Cantica she had told her – colleague, accomplice? The relationship there was still nebulous.

“That we have reason to expect that there will be an attack in the night,” Tristan suggested.

And then the idea came to him, quick and silver bright and so utterly tempting he could not resist.

“And that we should be ready to retreat from the Last Rest if trouble finds us,” he added.

Tredegar’s brow rose.

“You believe the night attack will be so dangerous?”

“He’s right,” Maryam said. “It could be a god they made a bargain with or a pack of devils, we cannot know. What we do know is that the Watch expects that attack to be capable of taking on fighters sharp enough to make it through the first two trials.”

“I would prefer to stand our ground,” Angharad admitted, “but some of us are not fighters so I’ll not deny it might be wiser to retreat and draw the enemy onto better grounds.”

And there was the shape of his opportunity. Dozens moving around at night, with violence and chaos afoot?

“We should pick two different locations for folk to gather at,” the thief casually said. “If we get dispersed, or are pursued, it might not be easy to gather in a single place or wait for everyone. I found a postern gate on the side of town, that can be one location. The front gate for the other?”

“That seems wise,” Tredegar nodded.

Silver eyes on him, but he did not flinch. Maryam would not have told her, he chose to believe that. Gods, how could he not when she has lost fingers to save his life?

“Each of us can head to one such place should the worst come,” Tristan said. “I imagine I should take the side gate, since I am the one who found it.”

A shrug, the Pereduri agreeing.

“And now we tell the others,” Tredegar breathed out.

She seemed tired, at long last.

“It would be best to split that duty up, each of us talk to only a few,” Tristan said. “Our hosts might notice something is happening otherwise.”

It was only sensible, so naturally they agreed, and he ignored the weight of Song’s piercing silver eyes as he rose.

“I need a favor,” he whispered to Maryam.

He got something like a smile, cold and entirely savage.

“I thought you might,” she said. “I’ll take care of it.”

Tristan did not begin with him, that would have been too obvious. He did not need to rush anyway, as Tredegar was now on poor terms with the man and so unlikely to approach. As for Song, well, Maryam just happened to want a word with her at that moment. Cozme Aflor was third on his list and already eyeing him warily by the time he sat across the man. The explanation was short, the mustachioed man then seeking Song’s eyes across the room and getting a nod in reply.

“Keep it quiet,” Tristan murmured. “Augusto will not be told and if there is chatter the townsfolk may notice we are onto them.”

“Of course,” Cozme nodded, stroking his mustache. “I will be most careful, Tristan.”

“I’ll see you there,” he smiled.

That ‘there’ did not happen to be a place where anyone but the two of them would be gathering was not something his father’s executioner needed to know.

Not yet.

—

As the last of them began going up the stairs, Tristan lingered just long enough to watch darkness begin to creep through the shutters. Night had come to Cantica, the lamplights ringing the town doused one after another. Alas, there would be no sleep for him.

His work was now beginning.

—

Patience did most of the work.

The thief waited until the innkeeper doused the last of the lights inside the Last Rest and left. There had been no doubt that the devil would, as a simple look at the size of the kitchen compared to the floor upstairs confirmed there was no chamber built for him to sleep in. Tristan waited for minutes more, then crept down the hall and the stairs. The windows were shuttered but the door was unlocked – cracking it open, he peeked through.

The streets were dark and empty, but there were lights in the distance.

He snuck out, closing the door behind him. The lights, he saw when got out to have a better look, were from torches. The town square, he thought. Tristan stayed off the main street as he went, keeping to alleys and passing behind houses. He could not risk going out in the open: not only did devils see in the dark but they were said to have uncanny senses. His method got him close to the square, but the particular alley was a dead end. Tristan could dimly make out voices, but he was too far for anything useful.

Grimacing, he eyed the side of the house he was hiding behind. There was a way up, with a little work. An empty crate – which creaked under his weight enough to have him wincing – got him a foot higher, enough he was able to wedge a foot against a jutting plank and grab at the edge of the tiled roof. Only the work was shoddy, he discovered, and if he held onto the tiles to pull himself fully onto the plank they were like as not to come loose. Swallowing a curse, the thief looked around for something to use and found a shovel with a bent head. He crept back down, took it and then tried to keep the crate’s groaning as a minimum as he wedged a foot against the plank again.

Using the shovel as a counterweight, he pushed himself so he could stand on the jutting plank. He was careful not to let the shovel fall, propping it against the wall, and then climbed the rest of the way onto the roof. Creeping up the tiles, he pressed himself against the cool clay until he had reached the top of the roof – and from there found a commanding sight of the town square below. The thief breathed in sharply. There were only a few torches, held up by the handful of pale-skinned hollows in the square, but there must have been more than fifty people in the square.

All of them looking like children of the Glare, but as he watched them mill around the cages Tristan could not help but feel they were slightly off. They weren’t moving quite right, arms and legs sometimes bending more as the confirmation of movement than the reason.

“- not seeing anything.”

A man’s voice but stilted. Like it took too much care pronouncing every syllable.

It was also coming from behind him, down in the alley.

Tristan held his breath, pressed close against the roof and prayed. Some shuffling down in the alley. There were at least two of them.

“It was a rat,” another voice said. “The thralls are getting fat, I tell you. They don’t hunt them as thoroughly as they used to.”

By the sound of it, one of the devils below kicked the shovel he’d left propped up.

“We better not have missed anything,” the stilted voice said.

A scoff that sounded ever so slightly of clicking mandibles.

“None of it means anything until Akados gets here,” the devil said. “The fresh casts listen to him like he’s some duke of Hell.”

“As if,” the stilted voice snorted. “He’s not even an elder, he-”

A crate was kicked, Tristan almost flinching at the sound.

“Still dangerous,” the other devil said. “Watch your wagging.”

Angry hisses, then he heard the pair walking away. Tristan held his breath until his lungs burned and his eyes watered, releasing it only when he was dead certain neither was close enough to hear him. That had been uncomfortably close. If he’d been just a little slower to climb… There was no time for fear to set in, however, as the crowd below coiled with unspoken tension. It was not hard to put a face to the source, as the devils around him all fell silent.

The devil wore the skin of middle-aged man, Tristan saw, with broad shoulders and a balding pate. He had a vaguely Malani look about him, and by the looks of the clothes the thief thought he was likely the town butcher. If that is not Akados I’ll throw away my hat. The devil deftly leapt up to sit atop one of the cages, the crowd of his fellows rippling around him. Tristan’s lips thinned: no man could have moved like that. It was simply not something people’s legs were capable of.

Mayor Crespin, or at least the devil wearing that skin and name, came to stand in the middle of the square and cleared his throat.

“Now that all are in attendance,” he said, voice slightly buzzing, “we can begin. We have a hunt and a hunter to choose this night.”

“Do we?”

The crowd shivered. The butcher, the one Tristan thought might be this ‘Akados’, had been the one to speak.

“It seems to me,” the butcher continued, voice slow and lazy, “that the rooks are in disarray. Their mountain collapsed; their fort was buried. This year is a loss to them, good as written off.”

A scoff from another in the crowd.

“They gave us rules when they stranded us here,” the other devil said. “A hundred years playing their game and the term is ended. Why should we risk the guns of the Watch instead, Akados?”

“To feed,” the devil replied, voice hungry for all the laziness. “Not the scraps they allow us, but to truly eat to our heart’s content as we were made to. Not nibbling at dun souls or breaking up a soul in pieces like biscuit – a proper meal.”

Dun? Tristan frowned. It meant dark, he recalled, or perhaps drab. He might mean the hollows. Rather more worrying was that the oldest devil in Cantica was attempting to talk the others into what sounded like a massacre of the trial-takers and there was not a great deal of opposition to it. Still some, however.

“Everyone knows you anneal from slaughter,” a devil called out. “You just want one to get closer to being evergreen, but what is that to us?”

Akados laughed.

“We all want a slaughter, Vane,” the devil replied, baring the teeth of a man and the pincer-like teeth of a devil behind them. “To feel them writhe in the Empty Sea, to partake of the colors. I will gain, true, but who here would not?”

A challenging look.

“They will not come after us with powder and shot for a year that is already scrapped,” Akados said. “We are not so easily replaced. And if we can get away with it, what is staying our hand?”

Reading a crowd of devils was like trying to read foreigners through a panel of silk, Tristan thought, but were he inclined to bet he would have said the crowd was already halfway talked into it. It was only a matter of time now: too many of the devils went eerily still whenever feeding was mentioned, the expressions of the shells gone slack with want.

It was, Tristan mused, time to get the fuck out Cantica before they all died.

The arguing would at least serve to cover the sound of his sliding back down into the alley. Tristan crept away, more hastily than he had come for he now felt the urgency biting at his back. Could he still pull things off with Cozme, now that he would not have the time to lay his ambush as he had planned? Maybe, he thought. He would need to take stock of things before deciding.

Yet even as he snuck his way back to the Last Rest, the thief forced himself to take a detour. Angharad Tredegar would be leading her lost lambs out through the front gate, but Tristan had his sights set on the postern – for more reasons than one. It would be best to first see if there were guards near it. Likely not devils, he thought, but perhaps hollows. Foes nowhere as fearsome, but perfectly capable of raising the alarm.

Steps silent, he turned the corner on the wooden sidewalk and risked a glance. The thief hissed in a breath, catching sight of movement and drawing back. He looked again, more carefully, and was relieved to see it was only one man with his back turned. The relief lasted only until he recognized the ragged cape he was looking at. With a soft cry of triumph, Augusto Cerdan ripped open the postern gate and swiftly moved aside.

This was, Tristan dimly thought as cultists began pouring into the town, going to be a problem.

# Chapter 42

She could not tell the difference between it and a dream before she woke.

/The lock popped open with a soft sound, Yaretzi brushing past a kneeling form and creeping in with a rag in hand to cover Angharad’s mouth with it./

Angharad woke up looking at the ceiling, asleep and then not. It had been a glimpse, the Fisher pulling at their contract once again. The spirit had only ever done this to prevent her death, yet the noblewoman stayed lying down and looking at the ceiling as she heard the lock pop open. She should move, she thought, but could not quite bring herself to. Angharad’s mind was clear, awake, but her limbs were still dozing. It would have been easier to move the entire world than to move them.

A flicker of movement, then she found Yaretzi’s dark eyes above and a ragged cloth was being pressed against her face. There was a scent to it, sickly sweet, and Angharad dimly realized she was being drugged. Finally that tore through the veil of somnolence and panic rose sharply in her breast – Angharad tried to rise, to fight off Yaretzi, who pushed her down and cursed.

“-eight, nine,” the Izcalli was counting through gritted teeth.

Ten, Yaretzi reached, and Angharad felt a different numbness in her limbs. She tried to shout, but the sound came out slurred as if she were deep in her drinks. The Izcalli holding her down eyed her warily.

“Another five seconds just in case, I think,” Yaretzi said. “It is only Spinster’s Milk, dear, it won’t kill you.”

Angharad kept struggling, but it was as if her limbs had turned to lead. She could no longer feel her own jaw. Yaretzi glanced back at the door the noblewoman hadn’t heard closing and Angharad’s heart clenched at what she saw found there. Calm-eyed, holding a mostly shuttered lantern, Brun leaned back against the wood. She tried to say something, but between the poison and the cloth she got out only a formless moan.

“You told me your contract almost never breaks when used on a sleeper,” the Izcalli challenged.

“Almost,” Brun indifferently replied. “It could be because she has a contract herself.”

His hand was on his hatchet, fingering the haft in an unknowing tic. Yaretzi sighed.

“That’s what I get for working with amateurs,” she said. “I need to make a sweep to see if anyone noticed us, keep an eye on her meanwhile.”

The fair-haired Sacromontan shrugged. His accomplice narrowed her eyes.

“I need to ask her questions,” Yaretzi said. “So no accidents, Brun, or we have a problem.”

“Understood,” Brun simply said.

Even as the Izcalli rose and left, Angharad realized that what she had thought indifference in Brun’s voice was no such thing. His tone had not once changed since he came into the room, always in the same flat near monotone. The blonde traitor came to stand by her bed, idly pushing her back down when she tried to force herself up. She was so weak, her limbs like a child’s. The pair meant to kill her – they must, for they must know that otherwise she would slay them for this – but fear was slow in in coming.

Anger burned in its stead, like embers in the belly. Why, she tried to ask, a scream of outrage and confusion. What came out was a muted, slurred whergh but Brun understood her regardless. Emotion touched his face, but she thought it looked shallow. Regret only a fingernail deep.

“I am sorry it must be you,” Brun said. “You have treated me kindly and do not deserve it. But there is no one else I would get away with, and I am… too close.”

Another flicker of emotion at the last two words, this one deeper than the last. Fear, Angharad saw.  That was as afraid as she had ever seen the man.

“If I take Yong or Sarai, Tristan will knife me in the night,” Brun explained. “Shalini is now being watched like a hawk and Lan, well, she knows of me. She will have taken precautions. Already she has tried to kill me once.”

Angharad let out a noise a denial at the false accusation, just another traitor reaching for absolution. Brun shook his head at her.

“She bought Spinster’s Milk from Yaretzi,” he said. “I expect she put it in my waterskin, a small dose that would slowly add up, as I did not notice until that test on the Toll Bridge.”

That was… she had thought Brun seemed clumsy, when she watched him chasing the invisible spirit. But why would Lan – it took a second for her mind to catch up to the truth he had good as admitted. You killed Jun, she tried to say.

“Jush kwid jewn.”

“It was nothing against her,” Brun shrugged. “She was closest and the twins had just fought Tristan, which I thought would muddy the waters.”

Sleeping God, how much had she missed? Was she struck with blindness, the only fool among a pack of wolves? It felt like she had been struck in the belly, the breath wheezing out of her. Twice Brun had killed, and now she was to be the third. And she did not even know why. Some of that must have shown on her face, for the man sighed.

“I owe you for distracting the cultists during the Trial of Lines,” Brun acknowledged. “And I suppose the knowledge won’t be going anywhere.”

The man considered her with cold eyes.

“There is a festival in the Murk,” he said. “A week where lamplights are repaired, many of them taken down at once, so nowadays people hang small red paper lanterns and make small games in the streets. The Trench sends miners back to the city around that time, and my mother loved making the lanterns. It was one of the few things we did together.”

It was, Angharad thought, horrifying to hear what sounded like such a personal story in such an utterly detached tone.

“When they died, well, that is a long story,” Brun said. “But I clutched to one of those paper lanterns like it was the last thing I had. Prayed to it, almost. And someone heard me.”

The blond man’s eyes went unfocused as he glanced to the side, as if he were staring at something Angharad could not see. Brun frowned before turning his gaze back to her.

“A young god,” he said. “Farolito, the god of that nameless festival. I am his first contract.”

Brun shrugged.

“He wanted to help,” he said. “But gods are not men, especially when so young.”

He glanced to the side again, looking annoyed, then back to her. He is being visited by his god.

“I would have died if not for the pact,” Brun clarified. “But he did not realize what he was asking, nor I what I was giving. I wanted to hide, for the vultures to leave me alone, and so he let me press calm into others. Empty them of everything, like the moment after the end of a festival. To do this I must be able to feel their presence, so I could.”

So that was the truth of the strange lethargy that had taken her. And of how he had been able to feel their pursuers during the Trial of Lines and the flight to Cantica.

“In exchange,” Brun tonelessly continued, “he took what he loves of the festival: emotions. Not the entire length of them, only the strong parts, and I thought it a bargain. I would never fear again, never weep in the dark.”

He paused.

“I was wrong.”

The simple, matter-of-fact way he spoke those three words sent a shiver down her spine.

“It feels worse when I use my contract,” Brun said. “As if all of Vesper is growing quieter, every noise falling away. And the noise, it does not return. I began to forget what it felt like to feel anything at all, and could not even muster fear that one day I would simply lay down and not care as I starved.”

The blond man clicked his tongue, hand swatting away at something only he could see.

“He is not an evil god,” Brun dutifully told her. “He meant no harm. And we found a loophole together: I could no longer feel my own emotions, but I could still feel his.”

And with dawning horror Angharad began to understand where the tale was heading.

“We tried many things, we did,” the man said. “Did you know, Lady Angharad, that in the moment a man – one not owned by the Gloam, not dimmed – dies, their presence in the aether is searingly bright? All the colors and emotions of their weave, there then gone.”

He raised his hand and snapped his fingers, the sound a sharp contrast to the serene face.

“There is nothing Farolito loves even a hundredth as much as a death save for the festival, and that is only once a year,” Brun said. “So I did what I must.”

It never ceased to astonish Angharad what manner of ugliness could fit under the mask of I did what I must, as if behind that excuse lay an endless pit dug for horror’s sake. The blond man cocked his head to the side.

“I rationed it, used the pact only when I must,” the Sacromontan said. “Every six months, more or less. It was still dangerous and I decided the Watch might be able to help, to fix it. I chose the Dominion as my way in so they cannot refuse me when they find out what I do.”

That was, her uncle had told her, the virtue of these trials: that to pass them saw you enrolled directly into the ranks of the Watch. Brun sighed.

“But I have had to use my contract so very much,” he said, sounding faintly irritated. “To find enemies, to grasp who was lying to me or trying to get me killed. And so the world grew quiet.”

The blond man met her eyes.

“Jun was to tide me over so I would last the rest of the journey with the infanzones,” Brun said. “Aines was because it was starting to grow difficult feigning emotion.”

His gaze was unblinking.

“I used my pact too much when we ran from cultists on the way to Cantica,” the Sacromontan said. “Making sure Song was not leading us into an ambush. At this rate, I might have to kill a blackcloak in Three Pines. Accepting Yaretzi’s offer was the least risky-”

The door opened and Brun reached for his hatchet, but Angharad’s half-formed hopes were dashed: it was only Yaretzi returning. The Izcalli carefully closed the door behind her.

“No lights under the doors,” she told Brun. “More interestingly, Tristan is no longer in his room and neither is Augusto Cerdan. It seems we are not the only ones cleaning up before the vote. I told you, my dear: that boy is most definitely a hired killer.”

“He is a rat to the bone,” the man said. “You mistake him.”

“How has he convinced so many people of that?” Yaretzi complained. “After Lan traded me his suspicions for the Milk I knew the little bastard was too dangerous to leave sniffing around, but no one would bite. The best I could manage was to send Ferranda after Isabel in the hope she stumbled into whatever they’ve been doing about the Cerdan. Thirteen Heavens, my darlings, that boy has gone around half the trials lugging around the exact same poison box Watch assassins use. How has no one outed him for it yet?”

Yaretzi turned to smile at her, like they were friends sharing a confidence, and Angharad felt like ripping out her teeth. Death was crawling closer to her with every word and she kept waiting for the fear to come, but the warmth of anger yet kept it out. Like keeping your hand so close to candle flame it began to burn, chasing out every other sensation.

“He must be fresh to the profession,” Yaretzi told her. “As a rule you should bring only the substances you intend to use, it is much less obvious.”

Brun shifted on his feet.

“You made your sweep,” he said. “Let us finish it.”

“Soon, soon,” Yaretzi said. “I told you, I need her to answer some questions first.”

The Izcalli idly unsheathed a knife, then knelt by Angharad’s side. She tried to get up, but her limbs had grown so feeble they did not even need to push her back down. The point of the steel was drawn across her cheek and came to rest under her eye, lightly enough it did not cut skin.

“The tiles in the kitchen of Llanw Hall,” Yaretzi said. “What color are they?”

Angharad clenched her jaw as much as she could, which still had her tongue lolling in her mouth. Yaretzi eyed her, then sighed.

“Torture is very messy, dear, I do hope you won’t force me to resort to it,” the Izcalli said. “Let us try again with something easier, then. Your uncle Osian – where is he getting all the coin? Did your mother perhaps bury a fortune somewhere, tell him of the location?”

Angharad blinked. What coin? Yaretzi’s eyes narrowed impatiently.

“The man has been spending gold like it is copper, my dear,” the Izcalli said. “He put out an open contract matching whatever price is on your head for the skull of any assassin trying to take yours, and he’s known to have paid out at least ten times. I heard so many assassins slew each other trying to catch you in Ixta that the guilds in the city are still at war.”

Angharad choked. Ixta? The sleepy little port town on the Emerald Coast where she had spent exactly three hours waiting on the docks before changing ships? Yaretzi let out an irritated sound.

“Useless,” she said. “Do you know why he pulled the open contract, at least? Did he run out of coin? It happened when you arrived in Sacromonte and I know you received at least one letter from him there.”

Angharad leaned forward, as if to give answer, and Yaretzi came closer. Only when she tried to spit on the other woman her tongue would not move, so only specks of spittle flew and the rest stayed bubbling on her lips. Yaretzi withdrew with a sigh.

“Ayanda was not nearly this much trouble,” she complained. “So eager to talk, that girl, she gave me everything I needed the first day. It must have been her contract that got her recommended for the Krypteia, because she did not notice in the slightest when I doused her waterskin with Milk. Not much – just enough to slow her down some. The same dose I traded Lan.”

Yaretzi shrugged.

“After that it was just a question of waiting for her to stumble and be caught by those Red Eye savages.”

Looking at the smug pride on the Izcalli’s face, Angharad felt genuine hate for one of the few times in her life as she remembered the bleak grief on Zenzele’s face. How broken must you be, to make a living out of inflicting suffering?

“Don’t be jealous, dear,” Yaretzi chided. “House Sandile offered a tidy sum for the death of the little bitch who stole the husband of their matriarch’s favorite niece, but it’s not even half of what is on offer for you. I just decided to collect on the girl first after seeing you go up against that Saint. It seemed likely you would pick up wounds saving fools anyhow.”

Yaretzi wagged a finger.

“Only you kept surviving, you inconvenient darling you, and even when I got close you kept living through my attempts,” she said. “I tried to off you discreetly during the trial with the clockwork god and then again in the stairs with Ishaan, but you are a most difficult creature to kill.”

“Fugh yew,” Angharad snarled.

“I don’t tell you this to boast, my dear,” Yaretzi patiently said. “I tell you so might understand that I am not some hired thug but a professional, an anointed daughter of the Obsidian Society under brokered contract. It is our rule that learning knowledge which only the mark would know serves a proof of the kill, but when that is not feasible one may also present the head instead.”

She leaned forward.

“Tell me the color of the kitchen tiles in Llanw Hall,” Yaretzi said, “and your uncle will receive a corpse with the head still on it. I understand Malani have some funerary customs relating to eyes, no? Would you not prefer to ease his grief while you still can?”

“Aye ashm noth,” Angharad bit out, “Malani.”

And she would not help this creature to get away more cleanly with her crimes. Perhaps she could not fight, but she could at least try to make enough of a mess that these animals were caught. Song, Song would see to it. The silver-eyed Tianxi would not let this go, the sole comfort Angharad had in this ugly mess. She tried to rise again and found some sliver of strength yet remained to her limbs. Yaretzi clicked her tongue in disappointment.

“Fine,” she said, sheathing her knife. “It was always a long shot, and it’s not like torture is reliable when one cannot take their time. Brun, try not to make too much a mess. I’ll hold her down for you.”

Angharad half-raised her arm, but she was brushed aside like a child and pushed back into the mattress by a bored Yaretzi. That boredom somehow insulted her more than the rest of this put together. That she was a chore, not even a foe. Brun, face twisting with something like relief, approached with his hatchet in hand. Angharad met his eyes, burning with indignation, and the blond man stilled for a moment. His green eyes flicked to Yaretzi, almost considering, but then he sighed. The hatchet rose all the way.

Death came down for her as a sharp length of steel, only to slow.

A whisper sounded in her ears, rising to become the nearing beat of wings until it blotted out everything else and a strange power rippled through her body. Above her a single, beautiful peafowl feather drifted down from the ceiling and Angharad realized that her limbs no longer felt numb. The mayura’s blessing, it had cleared the poison. The spirit’s power left her, the hatchet coming down viper-swift again, but Angharad was no longer helpless.

She grabbed Yaretzi by the collar, dragging her in the way, and took vicious satisfaction the way the Izcalli’s eyes widened in utter surprise.

“Fuck,” the assassin cursed, the blow taking her in the shoulder with a wet thump.

Angharad kneed her in the stomach, Yaretzi stumbling back with a wheeze, and as she rose pushed the stumbling Izcalli into a surprised Brun. The back of his knees hit the bedside table, tipping her sheathed saber to the ground, and she caught it with the tip of her toes.

“Assassins,” she shouted, only halfway through realizing there was no use.

The door was closed and the owners of the two nearest rooms were in front of her. Brun yanked his hatchet out of Yaretzi’s back, earning a hoarse scream, and as he turned to hack at her Angharad deftly threw up her saber with her toes – she caught the scabbard just as his blow came down, slapping aside his forearm with it so the hatchet went by her shoulder. Yaretzi struck from the other side, knife back in hand, but Angharad halfway unsheathed her saber to strike her chin with the pommel of the sword and knock her back. She glimpsed-

/Brun hacked at her back, biting into her spine and sending her/

-and turned with a blow she would not have seen, getting out of the way just in time for the hatchet to take Yaretzi in the arm as she turned around Brun’s back and finished unsheathing the blade. She kept the scabbard in hand. Her knees almost buckled as a wave of apathy hammered into her mind, but elbowing Brun in the back had the sensation vanishing into smoke. She finished turning around to face them.

Brun was a skilled fighter, she thought, but it was a raw sort of talent. He had not been taught that being predictable in a duel was death. The Sacromontan pushed away from her from to make distance, so that he might have enough room to swing his hatchet, but Angharad had begun swinging even as she turned: the edge of the saber caught him at temple height and a slight angle, splitting his eye like an egg and sinking into the skull.

Death in a stroke.

Angharad calmly kicked his back as she ripped free the blade, brain spraying as it sent the corpse falling into Yaretzi’s way and forced the Izcalli to draw back nearer to the door. The assassin licked her lips, Angharad watching as it sunk in for the other woman that she was two wounds in and standing alone.

“You took an oath,” the Izcalli suddenly said. “Not to do violence on other trial-takers. If I no longer fight you, you cannot-”

Angharad threw the scabbard at her face. The knife went up to slap it aside, and that was all it took: the point of her saber went straight into Yaretzi’s heart, pinning her to the door with a thump as the assassin let out a wet gurgle.

“You knowingly broke the rules of the Trial of Weeds, assassin,” Angharad politely informed her. “You no longer qualify as a trial-taker.”

She broadened her stance, preparing to rip out the blade, but before she could the door burst open and the corpse flew at her. Smothering a sound of surprise, Angharad struggled to hold on to her saber as someone forced their way into the room – only to find Song levelling a musket at her, Sarai right behind her and sloppily pointing a pistol as she held up a lantern.

“You- oh,” Song said, taken aback.

There was a heartbeat of silence.

“Are we quite sure,” Sarai began, eyes lingering on the two cooling corpses, “that she was the one needing rescuing here?”

Angharad’s jaw locked.

“The mayura’s blessing saved my life,” she stiffly said. “They came at me with a poison and Brun’s contract.”

Her stare firmed as she turned to Song after saying thus.

“A jest,” Sarai said. “I meant no offence.”

Angharad did not reply, eyes staying on Song and silently asking why she had not warned anyone of Brun’s contract. It would have been a much stronger suspect than Ishaan’s, and while she could understand wanting to keep the power of her own eyes quiet that did not excuse warning no one at all.

“I do not know what it does,” Song admitted. “Did, now, I suppose. It was written in some sort of Sacromontan street jargon, half the words weren’t even recognizably Antigua.”

The noblewoman gave a slow nod and felt a knot in her shoulders loosen. Had Song been one of the pack of selfish schemers she was being forced to deal with, she was not sure what she would have done. So much of what she had taken to be truth before coming to this island was… Nobles acting like wolves, loyalty a hangman’s noose and honor in the strangest of places.  She had thought Peredur the model of the world, once, but now she was forced to wonder how much she might have missed.

Angharad swallowed, mind was still awhirl with all her killers had said. ‘Yaretzi’ was a confessed liar, so much of what she said about others could be discounted, but her talk of Tristan – and that he had been accomplice to Isabel, who she knew did have troubles with the Cerdan brothers – rang uncomfortably true.

Remund had disappeared after spending time alone with him, for which they had yet to receive account. No one had thought to take that up since both men were expected dead, but perhaps there was a need after all. Angharad felt a great exhaustion settle on her shoulders like a mantle, and with it a vicious urge: to out every dirty little secret this misbegotten island carried, to finally have it out and done.

Sarai cleared her throat.

“We should wake everyone else, have it known now the pair tried to kill you,” the pale-skinned woman said. “Else accusations might turn ugly come morning.”

“There is more to tell besides,” Angharad wearily said. “Brun effectively confessed to the murders of both Jun and Aines while Yaretzi admitted to being a member of something called the Obsidian Society as well to poisoning Ayanda with something called Spinster’s Milk.”

Sarai let out a noise of surprise.

“Zenzele won’t take that well,” she warned.

“He must be told regardless,” Angharad replied.

Though first, she decided, she should drag the corpses out into the hall. The blood was soaking her floor. Wiping her blade on Yaretzi’s back, Angharad went to pick up her scabbard and sheathed it. She was about to go looking for her boots when someone turned the corner: Shalini, looking haggard but with both pistols up, stumbled into the scene and froze. A heartbeat later Ferranda followed, blade in hand, and then Zenzele half-tripped past them as he pulled on his boots.

“Huh,” Ferranda said.

The Someshwari lowered her pistols. Shalini’s eyes flicked back and forth between them and the dead.

“What happened?” she asked.

“They attempted to kill Angharad in the night,” Song told them. “It went poorly.”

“No shit,” Shalini amusedly said. “I could have told them how that’d go if they’d asked.”

“And the other two of you?” Zenzele asked with a frown, finally dragging his boot up.

A pause. Angharad turned to the other two women, cocking an eyebrow. What had drawn them to her room? She had thought the sound would not carry. Sarai sighed.

“At Song’s request, I put a Sign on Lady Angharad’s door that would break if someone opened it,” she said.

“They had me at their mercy for quite some time,” Angharad neutrally said.

She appreciated the gesture, but not the presumption. Besides, why her of all people?

“I slept through it breaking,” Sarai admitted, sounding embarrassed.

She reddened under the number of incredulous looks thrown her way.

“Look, it’s not a Sign I have fully mastered and I haven’t had a good night’s sleep in days,” she said. “I ended up waking up later and noticing it was gone, so I went to get Song and we found…”

“Predictable consequences?” Zenzele drily finished.

Whatever else might have been said, it was forced to wait. More were joining them, the rising sound of talk in the hall drawing them. Tupoc first, who made a point of theatrically gasping as the sight of the bodies then, Lan and Cozme.

Angharad face them, face still flecked with blood.

“Let me get dressed,” she sighed, “and then I will tell you everything.”

—

It was not long to explain, for all that it had felt an eternity when the pair had her prisoner.

Zenzele’s face went bloodless when he was told his beloved had been drugged into demise at the behest of House Sandile, Shalini laying a hand on his arm, while Tupoc looked slightly miffed. Remembering Yaretzi’s confession regarding the stairs, Angharad made her amends there.

“I did not believe you when you claimed Ishaan was pushed by her,” the noblewoman said, addressing Shalini. “Yet she did, and I apologize for my mistrust.”

The other woman grimaced.

“We looked pretty shady at the time,” she replied. “Water under the bridge.”

As for Ferranda, Angharad was too tired to keep secrets any longer.

“Song and I found a secret passage in the gate shrine and overheard your conversation with Isabel when you accused her,” she bluntly said. “Yaretzi has since confessed that she directed you after Isabel in the hopes that you would stumble into some alleged plot against the Cerdans she was weaving with Tristan.”

Ferranda Villazur drew back in surprise.

“I – are you sure? Tristan?”

“I am certain she said it,” Angharad said. “She also confessed herself a murderer and a liar, so I put little stock in her words.”

The grey-eyed man was a criminal of some sort, and prone to tricks, but he had also demonstrated a certain sense of honor. Several times he had risked his life on behalf of others to no clear gain.

“The boy is suspicious,” Cozme grunted. “He came back and Remund did not.”

“He came back with a belly wound from falling down that slide with your Cerdan,” Sarai flatly replied. “Had to be treated for lockjaw, you can ask the blackcloaks. Your boy Remund wasn’t quite so lucky and he’s still impaled somewhere in the maze as far as we know. Nasty way to go.”

She did not sound all that sympathetic.

“Where is he right now, then?” the mustachioed man pressed. “Yong cannot leave his room, but where is the rat?”

“Investigating the activities of the townsfolk, as I requested of him,” Song flatly said. “I find it somewhat interesting you do not ask where Augusto is, as he is also missing.”

Cozme straightened.

“Augusto is no longer my responsibility, but Remund was-”

“Nobody cares about your brats, Cozme,” Lan interrupted, tone impatient. “Tristan could have slit both their throats in the middle of the street and most of us would have clapped. Tredegar, get on with it. What about Brun?”

Cozme Aflor looked more than a little angry, but he had no friends in the hall. Angharad laid out the rest of what Yaretzi had told her, prompting an interested noise from Tupoc at the mention of the Obsidian Society.

“They are famous assassins in Izcalli,” he informed them all in a rare display of concord. “They are a cult of the Skeletal Butterfly that takes killing contracts, they’ve been around for centuries. Rumor has it they even slew a Grasshopper King once.”

She moved on to Brun, after that, and revulsion rose as she described his contract and how it had slowly turned him into a murderer. The description of its effects had Shalini grimacing.

“I felt something like that on the night Jun was killed,” she admitted. “When I had the watch. I thought I was just tired and never entirely fell asleep so I said nothing save to Ishaan, but everything Lady Angharad speaks of is something I have felt.”

Lan looked murderous, an unusual look on her face, but then what did Angharad know? Both Yaretzi and Brun had accused her of poisoning him before the Toll Road, something the Pereduri had mentioned and the blue-lipped woman not denied. Angharad had thought herself aware of most the undercurrents in their company, wise to its workings even if she occasionally missed pieces, but that illusion had just been most thoroughly stripped away. Others had danced around her so deftly she never even noticed she was attending a ball. No more of that, Angharad coldly thought. She would not be made such a fool again.

Tupoc, who was closest to the stairs, suddenly tensed. He raised a hand at the rest of them, demanding silence as he raised his spear.

“Someone just came in,” he whispered.

Lord Zenzele glanced at their group, then down below.

“It is Tristan,” he said.

He had used his contract, she thought. Tristan must have a tie to someone in here.

Tupoc did not put the spear down.

“Xical,” Angharad warningly said, hand going to her blade.

“Three in a night would just be greedy, Tredegar,” Tupoc chided her amusedly.

He put the weapon down, however, just as someone began hurrying up the stairs. The loudness of it was startled her. Tristan was a light-footed man, yet now he stomped up at a run. The scruffy grey-eyed man erupted past the threshold, steps stuttering when he saw them all gathered in the hall.

“Oh,” Tristan said. “Everyone is here. Good.”

His eyes flicked to the corpses, unmoved at the sight. He did not even ask.

“Finally showing up, are you?” Tupoc drawled. “Lateness is becoming a habit with you.”

“Tupoc, shut the fuck up,” the man said, and there was a ripple of surprise at that unusual boldness. “We do not have time for this. I was just in the town square, where our hosts – every single one of which is a devil – were having a spirited conversation about eating us all.”

The silence was instant and complete.

“Then on my way back,” Tristan ferociously continued, “I passed by the postern gate where I happened to catch Augusto Cerdan letting in a warband of cultists. This happened-”

He produced a small timepiece, popping open the lid to see. It felt vaguely familiar.

“- three minutes and change ago,” he finished. “By now I expect they will be moving to free the slaves.”

Noise erupted all at once, half a dozen people speaking up. Song’s voice cut through, clear and calm. Trained, Angharad thought. Song Ren had been trained for command, or at least leadership.

“Dress and arm yourselves,” she said. “Everything else can wait.”

Some grumbling, but Angharad cut through it by hurrying to her own room and picking up her bag. Enough followed suit at the sight of her that the rest were pressured into doing the same. It had been a mostly symbolic gesture on her part, as her affairs were already packed, and she was back within moments. Just in time to hear Song and Sarai interrogating Tristan.

“- one was older than the others, called Akados, and some of the other devils accused him of wanting to ‘anneal’ through slaughter,” the man said. “I have no real notion of what that might mean.”

“Older devils eventually become fixed shapes in the aether,” Song absent-mindedly replied. “Their kind calls that process annealing, like the smithing term.”

She would know, the Pereduri thought. The Republics allowed devils citizenship, sometimes even to serve as bureaucrats.

“What does it mean, a fixed shape in the aether?” Angharad asked, stepping close.

“What she said,” Tristan supported.

She fought down the flicker of fondness. His eyes had not wavered at the sight of the corpse and too many black rumors yet hung over his head. Angharad was done putting trust in smiling strangers.

“It means no matter how many times you kill them they’ll crawl back out of the aether eventually,” Sarai grimaced. “Old devils are nothing to trifle with, though this one should yet fall short of the threshold.”

“If it is old enough to be discerning about the kind of aether it feeds on, it must be getting close,” Song warned. “I expect if it fed on the simpler aetheric taint of murder rather than ‘slaughter’ it might have finished the process.”

Angharad cocked her head to the side.

“Is this… discernment why devils in stories are afflicted with strange compulsions?” she asked.

Children’s tales had clever heroes outsmarting them by spilling beads the devils then had to count, tricking them into suicide for being unable to find a rhyme for their sentence.

“More or less,” Song said. “But that conversation can wait until we are in a place of safety. Tristan, you have your affairs?”

“Everything I care to carry,” the grey-eyed man said, then paused.

He turned to Sarai.

“Yong?”

She grimaced.

“He cannot stand,” she replied.

“Then we will have to carry him,” Tristan flatly replied. “Lady Angharad, if I might ask for your help?”

A worthy cause, Angharad thought, and so she nodded her head.

She was the one who knocked, a muted voice telling her to enter. Yong was lying in his bed, half-naked but his torso so thoroughly covered by bandages he might as well have been wearing a shirt. Only his arms and part of his shoulders were left bare – the expanse of skin drawing attention to the loaded pistol he was pointing their way. The barrel wobbled when he began coughing wetly, and his eyes were watery. He recognized them after a moment, lowering the pistol and setting it on the bedside table.

“What happened?” he croaked. “I heard voices.”

“Brun and Yaretzi tried to off her,” Tristan bluntly said, jutting a thumb Angharad’s way. “She killed them instead, I hear, and outed all their dirty little secrets.”

Angharad eyed him, reluctantly amused.

“Tristan went to spy on the townsfolk and found out they are all devils,” she contributed. “Augusto Cerdan, the honorless cur, has also let in a warband of cultists.”

The timepiece snapped open, then closed. Angharad could not shake the feeling that she had seen it somewhere before.

“About five minutes ago,” Tristan said. “We need to get moving or we’ll be hip deep in devils and darklings soon.”

Yong let out a rattling breath.

“My stitches won’t hold,” he said. “I cannot move.”

“That is why we came to carry you,” Angharad said.

“You mishear me,” Yong said. “It is not that I cannot walk – I cannot move. The physician told me I am to stay abed for at least two weeks.”

“That physician was a devil who wanted to eat you,” Tristan pointed out, quite reasonably in your opinion.

“I saw the stitches in a mirror,” the older man replied. “They cover much of my back, and if they rip there is no question that I will die.”

“I do not dismiss your concerns,” Angharad assured him. “We will ask for the help of others and take great care. But we most move, Yong.”

“She’s right,” Tristan quietly said. “The devils will come here for certain, it’s where the meal is.”

Yong stared at them for a long moment, then breathed out.

“I know,” he finally said. “I know. And it would be an ugly way to die.”

He clenched his fingers.

“I expect I won’t be able to move much,” Yong said. “I may have to trouble you to carry word for me, Tristan.”

The younger man stilled, face closing like a shutter.

“Your husband?”

Angharad frowned, for the Sacromontan sounded like he hoped he was wrong. Yong nodded. After a grimace, Tristan nodded back. She could not help but feel as if she were intruding, somehow. The Tianxi’s stare moved on to her.

“I require some privacy,” he told her.

“I understand it is unpleasant, but you will need help to dress,” she said, trying to be delicate.

“Some matters require privacy,” he gently replied, eyes flicking to the chamber pot.

Ah, Angharad thought with some embarrassment. Indeed she would prefer not to be there for that.

“Yong,” Tristan began, but the veteran raised a hand.

“Don’t,” he said. “We have said all we need to say. Nothing has changed.”

The grey-eyed man looked like he wanted to argue, but instead he let out a long breath

“I guess it hasn’t,” Tristan said, voice soft.

He sharply nodded, then walked away. Angharad followed him out, carefully closing the door behind her. Tristan leaned against the wall, folding his arms, and the frown that had never quite left deepened at the sight of how grim he looked. How his jaw was clenched.

“He lied,” she said.

She had suspected as much, but now knew.

“He-”

A shot sounded from behind the door.

Tristan flinched.

“He chose to make it quick,” the man hoarsely said, “instead of ripping his stitches and suffering hours of agony before the same end. It was…”

Tristan licked his lips.

“It was his choice to make.”

He sounded, Angharad thought, like a man who was not sure who he was trying to convince. She should have been angry at being deceived again, but Angharad could not muster it when she saw the grief in cast of face. Tristan pushed off the wall, a slight tremble to his hand.

“If you’ll excuse me,” he got out, “I need to make sure my friend died with the first shot.”

For he had not, Angharad realized with faint horror, Tristan would have to finish the job himself. She watched him open the door, glimpsed the billow of powder smoke and red on the wall, then looked away.

She kept her eyes on the stairs as she heard him see to his dead friend, fighting not to throw up.

—

No one asked what had happened to Yong: seeing Tristan lay his body to rest on the bed was enough to quell that urge in even the most curious among them. Angharad’s gaze swept through their company, finding them assembled and as ready as they would get.

She swallowed, gaze still shying away from the room where a man had taken his own life.

“We are to proceed, then,” she said. “Song has shown all of you the map, so all should know where we are to gather: half a mile north of here, by the marked stones.”

“It has all been said before,” Lord Zenzele mildly said. “Shall we?”

She threw him an irritated glance but nodded. Yet before she could take a single step down the stairs, a metallic sound drew her eye – and that of most present. Tristan had gone back into Yong’s room and tipped a lantern. Oil spilled over the corpse of the veteran, spreading a tide of softly lapping flame.

“I am not leaving him for the devils to eat,” the grey-eyed man evenly said. “Besides, it can serve as a distraction for our escape.”

Several looked like they wanted to argue but the oil was quite literally already spilled and now the bedding was catching aflame. There was no time to waste, not that they had been rich in minutes before.

“Hurry,” Angharad said, cutting through the silence. “If they do not yet know we are onto them, they soon will.”

She moved down the stairs, knowing that action would cut through any urge to argue: no one wanted to debate with a departing back. She heard steps follow behind, adjusting her scabbard on her hip so it would not hit the wall, and in moments she’d reached the common room. There her steps stuttered for she found she was not alone. Angharad moved out of the way so the man behind her – Tupoc – could follow, but her eyes never left the man she was facing.

Only Mayor Crespin was not truly a man, was he?

The devil wearing the corpse of a bearded, middle-aged man was waiting by the exit, flanked on both sides by two closed shutters. He leant against the door, square in their way should they want to leave.

“I hear fire,” the devil said.

“We hear of plots,” Angharad replied, the others coming down behind her.

Lantern light ate away at the shadows of the room, muskets rising and blades leaving scabbards. The mayor seemed unmoved by their numbers.

“’tis a poor notion,” Crespin said, tone dipping in a formal, almost antiquated Antigua. “Yet my kin agreed, so it must be done.”

In the distance, she heard shots. The mayor twitched. As he should, if the cultist warband was loose in town and gathering their slaves against them.

“You have greater worries than we, I think,” Angharad said. “Can you truly afford this distraction?”

The devil seemed amused.

“Why should I worry of a scapegoat skipping all the way to the altar?” he asked. “It was not us that killed them so, good blackcloaks, but arrant cultists of the Eye.”

Her jaw clenched at the mockery.

“It need not come to violence,” she tried one last time.

“You are lucents,” Crespin told her, not unkindly. “No thing done to you may be named violence.”

There was no bargain to be had here, not with a creature such as this.

“Walk away,” Angharad said, slowly unsheathing her blade. “While you still can.”

Mayor Crespin twitched, lifeless eyes looking her up and down – not with a lover’s appraisal but a butcher’s, tracing the cuts in the meat.

“Alive, if you can,” the devil ordered.

The shutters exploded into wooden shards, devils bursting through them. Shots sounded from behind Angharad, billowing plumes of smoke as her allies fired their guns, and one of the silhouettes was swatted down – but rose a heartbeat later, half of its face missing and revealing cracked chitin. Crespin was still leaning against the door, having merely cocked his head an inch to the side to avoid a bullet.

“Focus fire on the wounded one,” Song called out from behind her, voice completely calm. “Crack the carapace.”

Leaving tactics in good hands, Angharad strode out to meet the enemy with allies at her side – Tupoc on one side, Zenzele the other. A dark-haired woman with a tanned, weathered face leapt at her like an animal. It was a startling jump, impossible with human legs, but momentum was a universal shackle: Angharad slid under the leaping form, letting her pass by, and then pivoted cleanly to open her from shoulder to spine.

Skin parted like parchment, but under it some kind of oily chitinous carapace refused to give under her blade. She left a long scar and the devil screamed, but she was turning around furiously within a heartbeat. Painful, then, but not a wound. Angharad caught a glimpse of Tupoc impaling a devil through the stomach, nailing the false man to the floor, and of Zenzele struggling with a bald old man. Rapid fire from the back still nailing the fourth attacker to the ground.

Crespin watched all, indifferent.

She had no more attention to spare. Her devil let out a furious clicking screech, skin rippling as it struck at her. A simple slap that would have hit her shoulder, and though quick it was predictable. Angharad caught it with her blade angled to go through the wrist, her training moving before her mind, only instead of cutting off the hand she almost lost her blade. Even that slight, awkward blow had been like getting kicked. Lips thinning Angharad drew back her blade, scarring carapace again, and glimpsed-

/Skin rippled, a leg ripping its way out and piercing her throat./

-in time to half-step out of the way of the jutting, thin limb that lanced out of the devil’s back. Angharad aimed her swing carefully, and finally the blade bit through: steel ripped through the horrid appendage, dropping it as the devil screeched and scuttled back. The severed leg twitched on the floor, bloodless and seemingly boiling. The sight of it inspired a deep, visceral disgust in her.

Her devil foe was twitching uncontrollably under the shell, two more legs ripping their way out as it skittered away in fear of her. Tupoc’s own opponent lay on the ground, convulsing – Sleeping God, what was that segmented spear made of? – and the Izcalli was giving a bloodied Zenzele a hand driving back his own as the firing line pinned the fourth to the wall with shots and burst its belly open into a spurt of disgusting pale flesh. They were winning, she thought, but one of their foes had yet to take the field.

“Pathetic,” Mayor Crespin said. “Useless castings one and all, a waste of His Infernal Majesty’s grace.”

“Stathera,” her devil whined, “they are-”

Crespin moved, fast enough she saw but a blur, and then he was holding the wounded devil by the throat. Without batting an eye, he tossed his comrade at the firing line. Angharad let out a cry of warning – she heard Cozme draw his sword, cursing, and a glimpse of Tristan fumbling with a pistol she had last seen in Yong’s hand.

The distraction cost her, for in that heartbeat Crespin casually grabbed a table and smashed it down on her.

Angharad brought up her hands to shield her head and was hammered into the ground, dazed. The wood splintered atop her. Hissing in pain she kicked off the piece pinning her down, rolling out of the way just in time to see Crespin ram his way through the counter and rip out a long and sharp piece. His eyes turned further away, where the tossed devil was fighting the others in a messy sprawl, and Angharad saw what he was looking at: the lanterns.

Devils saw in the dark. Humans did not. Without the lanterns, they were all dead.

With a cry she threw herself forward, hacking wildly at his arm, and the devil turned at her with an irritated look – a slap caught her in the belly, near cracking a rib and sending her tumbling away on the floor. She stopped only when her shoulder hit the wall, just under one of the windows. Through which, she saw with surprise, a musket was being aimed. Angharad had just long enough to drop her sword and cover her ears so she would not go deaf from the shot.

A dozen muskets unloaded into common room, the cult of the Red Eye announcing their entry into the fight.

Snarling, Angharad reached out through the window and dragged a man through it by his collar – wincing at the tenderness of her ribs – to smash his face into the floor. The hollow flailed, shouting, and as she rose she snatched her blade back even as her booted heel came down on the man’s neck to snap it. Someone tossed a javelin her way and she narrowly ducked behind the still-closed door. Two cultists leapt inside the inn through the windows but a heartbeat later Mayor Crespin darted out of the smoke to rip one’s jaw out, nonchalantly gobbling down the flesh and bone as the cultists screamed – the older devil was driven away by musket shots, but he would be back. More cultists leapt in, swords high as they ran into the smoke.

There was no winning this, Angharad thought, eyes trying to find the rest of her companions but finding only an anarchy of powder smoke, steel and hateful blows. She opened her mouth, thinking to call for a retreat, but her words were drowned out.

A chunk of the ceiling dropped, revealing a burning inferno above as smoke swept out. The fire Tristan had set earlier, she recalled as she pushed down a hysterical swell of laughter.

“To the door with me,” she shouted over the roar of the flames.

Through the swirling smoke she saw silhouettes moving – some of them running towards her, others fighting. Ferranda leapt over burst of spreading flames, Lan hurrying behind her, and for a moment Angharad thought she saw Cozme headed her way as well. Only another chunk of ceiling fell in the way, the man drawing back with a shout, and he was dragged away by Tristan. Song was at her side a moment later, bleeding from the arm.

A chunk of it had been ripped out.

“We need to go,” the Tianxi shouted over the din. “Crespin broke a wall, the others have a way out.”

Angharad risked one last glance back, seeing a silhouette crossing the smoke. Short, coughing her lungs out. She brushed off Song’s hand on her shoulder, hurrying back to help Shalini out of the smoke as the Someshwari held on to her side.

“Open it,” she shouted at Ferranda.

The infanzona ripped open the door and Song ran through first, pivoting within moments and shooting at someone they could not see. They followed in the Tianxi’s wake, finding a dead cultist slumping against the wall with his musket on the floor as the rest hesitated, split between the devils inside and the fleeing company.

A bestial scream coming from inside burning wreck of the Last Rest was what settled the matter.

One of the cultists spitefully threw a javelin their way, but the others turned their muskets to towards the devils as the five of them fled into the streets.

—

There was little safety to be found out here, for chaos had seized the town.

Houses all over Cantica had been set aflame, and as they roared high slaves fled into the brutal melee between the cultists and the devils. Not all slaves were running for safety, however, many instead taking whatever lay around as weapons and joining the Red Eye cult in fighting the devils – some of which had lost patience and ripped their way clear of their shell, moving through the smoke like ghosts and ripping apart men as muskets sounded and spears bit into chitin.

“Manes,” Lan breathed out, “it’s a full-on uprising. We need to get out of here.”

“Stay close,” Angharad called out. “We head for the front gate.”

Of their party, only the Tianxi twin was not a fighter. The rest of them clustered around her: Angharad and Ferranda in front, Shalini and Song behind. They ran two blocks down before someone took notice of them, a cultist shouting and pointing their way to draw the attention of the mob of escaped slaves around him.

A heartbeat later Song put a shot between his eyes, which had half the slaves scattering as his body dropped.

They ran away before the other half, visibly enraged, could catch them. They turned a corner through a veil of smoke, following the curve of the palisade towards what should be the front gate. Twice more they ran into hollows, but the first time they were fleeing slaves who gave their company a wide berth and the second lot – three spearmen in mail – were chased off by a few shots. They were lucky, Angharad realized: the front gate was far from the fighting. The worst of it was deep in Cantica, where hollows had been kept imprisoned and the cultists now fought the devils.

Soon they were standing by the gates, which were yet closed. A wooden gatehouse by their side should carry the wheel that would open the gate, so the five of them carefully moved towards the simple wooden house nestled to the right of the gate. There was not a soul in sight, and barely any light: theirs came from the lantern Lan had lit and the inferno rising in the distance. The older Tianxi took the lead.

“Unlocked,” the blue-lipped woman said, testing the gatehouse’s handle.

She pushed it open, stepping into the dark with her lantern high, and in that same breath she was grabbed.

Angharad let out a shout of alarm, rushing forward through the doorway, but there was a flash as a musket was fired and Shalini only narrowly dragged her out of the way as a bullet whizzed right past her shoulder. Between the shot and Lan’s toppled lantern she caught a glimpse of what lay inside: at least three cultists with swords and muskets, pointing them at the door.

“See? I told you they would go for the gate, like rats leaving a sinking ship.”

Fury rose, bursting out as a snarl as she ripped her way out of Shalini’s grasp and recognized that voice.

“Augusto,” she hissed.

She could not see him, he was hiding out of sight, but by where the voice came from he must be the one who had taken Lan.

“I have a knife at your pet’s throat, you Malani bitch,” Augusto replied. “And enough men with me you have no hope of forcing your way through.”

Angharad glanced at Shalini, silently asking whether her contract would make a lie of that, but the short Someshwari grimaced and shook her head. However fast her hand, it was not faster than a finger already on the trigger.

“You have nothing to win by this,” Angharad snarled. “And know that if you kill Lan, I will personally torch that gatehouse with you inside it.”

The chokepoint of the door worked both ways: their muskets would keep his band in just as theirs would keep her company out. The Cerdan chuckled.

“He did this for leverage,” Song quietly said, lowering her voice so the men in the gatehouse could not hear. “He wants something from us.”

“Oh, he’ll kill us if he can,” Ferranda just as quietly said. “That was no warning shot. But I wager our Red Eye friends did not trust him with nearly as men as he would have liked, so he came ready to bargain.”

“How much is that rat’s life worth to you, Tredegar?” Augusto called out. “I happen to be in the mood to trade.”

Lan was under her protection, Angharad thought with a clenched jaw. She felt Song’s eyes on her, saw the objection that lay there, and ignored it. She would have no truck with expediency.

“What do you want, Cerdan?” she asked.

“An oath from all of you,” he said, and her brow rose. “You are to tell the Watch that you killed me, and if one of you breaks that oath you are to kill them for it.”

She frowned. Why would he need this? Angharad, unpleasant as the notion was, was not even entirely certain the blackcloaks would execute him for letting in the cultists. Tupoc had worked with them, and evidently felt safe in the assumption they would not. So he fears they will execute him for something else, she decided, and the answer soon came as to what that might be.

“You contracted with the Red Eye,” she evenly said. “Down in the maze. The Watch will kill you for it.”

“I am not hearing agreement,” Augusto called out.

A heartbeat later she heard Lan let out a cry, then struggle. Her fingers creaked around the grip of her saber, but to charge through that doorway was death.

“He cut me,” the Tianxi said, sounding like she had a hard time keeping calm.

“And I will do it again, until I have what I want,” the Cerdan said. “The rat for the oath.”

“I don’t understand why he wants it,” Shalini muttered. “It won’t get him off this fucking island, and it’s not like the blackcloaks will hunt him if he goes off with the cultist tribes.”

“He does not intend to stay on this island,” Ferranda guessed. “He would go back to Sacromonte.”

“The Watch will kill him for that contract,” Song said. “Unless…”

Unless he intended on killing them first, they all thought. To lead an army of cultists against Three Pines and seize a ship by force, sailing back to Sacromonte without them, and there hid behind the protection of House Cerdan.

“He’s gone mad then,” Angharad said. “A single warband and whatever slaves he press-gangs to take on a fortress of the Watch? They will make meat of him.”

Then she saw it, the lay of the scheme.

“No, not mad. He is thinking like a warlord,” she breathed out. “He would use the victory here to gather other tribes to his banner, try to unite them against the Watch.”

Even then the odds were against him, and her companions looked as skeptical as she felt. But that was why he wanted the oath, she thought. So he would have time to muster the tribes and yet still strike at Three Pines with the advantage of surprise. Perhaps he intended on feigning he was a late survivor and opening a gate as he had done here, or any other half-dozen schemes. It did not matter, Angharad thought.

If he wanted the stars in a cup, then she would make that promise.

“I will take your oath,” Angharad said.

“Angharad,” Song hissed.

She met those silver eyes squarely.

“I will take that oath,” she repeated, “and so will everyone here. In exchange for this you will release Lan unharmed.”

Doubts on their faces, but she would not brook contradiction in this.

“Good,” Augusto said. “How honorable of you, Malani. Swear to it, and I will do the same.”

Angharad did, and under her quelling eyes the others did the same. Lan was sent stumbling through the doorway, bleeding shallowly from the neck. Ferranda grabbed her and pulled her out of the line of fire. There was another spurt of laughter from inside the gatehouse.

“Shall we now bargain for us to open the gates for you?” Augusto called out. “Unless you want to come and try yourself.”

What she wanted, Angharad thought, was to take a lantern and set that gatehouse aflame. But that might break the mechanism that would let them out, and she was not sure strength alone would be enough to force open the gates. Her other choice was to pass by the heart of Cantica and try Tristan’s postern gate, but that was no true choice. She was not sure exactly where it was and the path was likely to be dangerous.

That and Augusto was certain to follow behind and try to rally cultists against them, now that he knew where they were.

They were the entire reason the man was here, Angharad realized. He had been afraid enough of them slipping out of Cantica in the chaos that he was sitting out the battle entirely.

“Speak your terms,” Angharad said, ignoring the rising anger of her companions.

“So pliant,” Augusto taunted. “You should have been like this from the start, Tredegar. I’ll have another oath from you for the privilege of my tolerance.”

“Then speak it,” she replied, losing patience.

He must have heard it in her voice, for he wasted no more time.

“You are to commit no violence against me nor allow your companions to do the same, or attempt to imprison me nor allow your companions to do the same,” Augusto said.

“Under that oath you could walk out and kill me and I would be allowed to do nothing about it,” she said. “I refuse.”

“Fine,” he snorted. “The same terms, but violence is allowed in your own defense and that of your companions.”

“That is a lifetime oath,” she noted. “I will accept it only within the confines of Cantica.”

“The entire island,” Augusto shot back.

Angharad’s eyes narrowed. He thought to play word-games with a daughter of Peredur? It would cost him.

“Until twenty-four hours have passed,” she offered.

A heartbeat of hesitation.

“Agreed.”

They took the oath, and a few moments later the gates began to open.

Angharad smiled, humming the first few bars of The Fair Wife, and considered the death of Augusto Cerdan.

# Chapter 43

It was a tight squeeze, but Tristan limped out into the alley.

He was third out of the hole in the wall the mayor made trying to murder Tupoc – an admirable undertaking, regardless of one’s politics or stance on people-eating – and the two that had come out ahead were as much keeping an eye on each other as the empty alley they stood in. The first, Lord Zenzele Duma, was cut of typical Malani cloth: tall, dark eyes, wide nose. Yet his cheeks were gaunt from grief and his soft noble features were gainsaid by the recent flint to his stare.

He was unharmed save for a bit of soot on his clothes.

In contrast Tupoc Xical, though as eerily perfect as usual, had suffered from the fight. Ironically not from the devils, two of which he had slain with whoops of joy, but from the volley the cultists had unloaded blindly into the Last Rest: he’d been shot twice, one bullet in his right shoulder near the edge of his breastplate and the other in the opposite thigh. Either should have knocked the man out of the fight but Tristan could see that the shoulder shot, from which Tupoc had casually ripped out the bullet, already looked like it was mending.

Not as quickly as it allegedly had in other circumstances, though. Was it because he had two wounds this time? Can the contract only heal a limited quantity of flesh at a time? Either way, while the Izcalli was steady on his feet he had chewed up limbs and his spear needed two arms to use. No wonder he was keeping a careful eye on Zenzele.

Maryam was next out of the hole in the wall that Mayor Crespin had meant to be in Tupoc’s head – with such a keen eye for popular policies, it was no wonder the devil had been elected mayor – and she coughed from the smoke as he helped her into the street. She’d gotten a bad knock on the head when the devil was tossed into the firing line that Tristan had been a nominal participant in, but her eyes no longer seemed as dazed.  She nodded her thanks.

“Your leg?” she rasped out.

“Good enough to walk,” Tristan said.

He’d got a bad roll of the dice when he pulled on his contract to force Cozme Aflor to get stuck on their side of the inferno: a chunk of collapsing ceiling had hit the man’s feet, which had flavored his backlash. The spray of wooden shards from a splintering board had hit mostly flesh, but he’d still had to tie cloth around his leg just above the knee to prevent his trousers being soaked in blood. They had not moved far from the hole in the wall, so when the last of them squeezed through he overheard the talk.

“My thanks for the help,” Cozme panted out, patting his clothes into order.

He he’d lost his musket during the chaos, by the looks of it.

“If you had not tugged me back, that chunk of ceiling would have caught my head.”

Tristan winced, which the older man took as sympathy, but was in truth over the prospect of how vicious his contract backlash would have been over that. The thief nodded back at Cozme, too on the edge to feign deeper companionship.

“We need to move,” Zenzele Duma cut in, voice tense. “I do not see Lady Angharad or the others, which means-”

“We make our own way out,” Tupoc cut in with a drawl. “Obviously.”

It seemed such a petty, pointless offence that Tristan was tempted to dismiss it as Tupoc being habitually unpleasant but the watchfulness of the Izcalli’s eyes revealed that to be a lie. A test, Tristan decided. He’s prodding Zenzele to see how close the man is to drawing on him. By how the Malani’s hand tightened around the grip of his sword, the answer was very close indeed.

“The postern gate is on the west side of town,” Tristan said. “The most direct route takes us through a street just short of the town square, however, so I would suggest cutting across town and circling around the north instead.”

“A longer trip will be more dangerous,” Cozme said.

There was crashing sound to their side as another chunk of ceiling collapsed inside the Last Rest, prompting a furious scream from the mayor and panicked shouting from the cultists still contesting the legitimacy of his election. Maryam cleared her throat.

“Let’s argue further away from that,” she croaked out, pointing at the mess.

Sound advice, which they all took. Heeding the thief’s suggestion of cutting east across town instead of keeping west, where the alleys often turned into dead ends meeting the palisade, the five of them fled. Tupoc took the lead, likely as much to keep his distance from the others as because he preferred the vanguard, and while Maryam kept Cozme distracted Tristan drifted towards the back.

Before he could so much as speak a word, Lord Zenzele Duma frowned down at him.

“You are a headache, did you know?” Zenzele said. “Half the people I speak to think you are a champion in the making, the other half that you are a feckless poison.”

Tristan cocked an eyebrow. Not even a poisoner – which admittedly he was – but poison outright. A bold claim.

“And you?” he asked.

“I am uncertain,” Zenzele grunted. “Which is disconcerting for more reasons than you know.”

Oh? That smelled of a contract, a morsel he might have liked to nibble at in other circumstances. Unfortunately, he must keep to greater concerns.

“I am a rat, that is all,” Tristan shrugged. “But, it seems to me, a rat who might share some interests with you.”

Bait had been set out but Zenzele Duma did not bite it. Instead the Malani noble kept silent, eyes flicking back and forth across thin air as if parsing out the invisible. An ill omen.

“What is it that makes you want to kill Cozme Aflor so very badly?” Zenzele suddenly asked.

Tristan stilled. He had been excruciatingly careful never to be outwardly hostile to the man. Even when he had spoken against Cozme during the discussion in the town square, it had been as part of several – and Yong’s broadsides at him afterwards should have distracted most from remembering it besides. Even now, approaching the Malani, he had not given a name. And Tupoc is the one who tried to get me killed for Jun’s death, so he should be the first guess.

This was the work of a pact, and the thought that one might allow Zenzele Duma to see through his every façade was… uncomfortable. Like learning your shirt had been split open at the back the whole time.

“Guesswork,” Tristan said, forcing his tone to be dismissive.

But he had hesitated for a second too long, he already knew, and Zenzele rolled his eyes.

“You want to use me,” the noble stated. “Send me after Tupoc while you go for him so he cannot intervene.”

That was an unpleasantly accurate read of his intentions.

Tristan swallowed, looking for anything at all on the man’s face he could use but finding no purchase. Zenzele Duma’s grief had been open, his hatreds were known and his recent friendships were obvious, yet the thief found through these nothing at all to move him. The thief looked away, deeply unsettled. Everything he had learned, been taught, told him that Zenzele Dum should be easy to leverage. Instead he was finding that the man’s forthrightness had whittled away every grip, leaving him too slippery to move.

“I owe him a debt,” Tristan reluctantly said. “The bloody kind.”

Zenzele considered that.

“As a servant of the Cerdan or on his own account?”

“Oh, very much his,” Tristan murmured.

Zenzele grunted.

“You do not strike me as man to whom hate comes easy,” the Malani said, rolling a shoulder. “I will presume it was earned.”

He spat to the side, into the mud of the street.

“I want Sarai’s help,” he said. “Wounded or not, he might well kill me otherwise.”

Practical of the man.

“She is no fighter even with Signs,” he warned. “But a distraction can be arranged.”

The noble looked like he wanted to push for more, but Tristan was only willing to promise so much and it must have shown on his face. There were other ways to line up his knife with Cozme Aflor’s back, this was simply the most expedient.

“Fine,” Zenzele said. “Signal me when the time comes.”

Tristan nodded back. However tense the conversation he found that in practice they had barely spent half a street quietly speaking. Tupoc had them turning a corner short two streets short of the piled lumber hiding the gaol, to head straight north as the thief had earlier suggested and no one cared to contest any longer. It was there they first ran into more than the distant sound of musket shots: a dozen slaves, bearing makeshift clubs and field tools, filled the street before them. They turned, faces alarmed, and before anyone could so much as raise a weapon Tupoc stepped forward. He lowered his spear, saying something in the same cant he had used earlier, and it gave the hollows pause.

Their leader, a grey-haired woman with broad shoulders, asked something harshly. Tupoc shrugged, replying, and there were a few more terse exchanges before the hollows began to make room for them to pass through the street.

“Tupoc?” the thief asked.

“I made it known we have fought devils as well,” the Izcalli said. “That earned us some goodwill.”

“They will let us cross?” Cozme asked.

“So they said,” Tupoc cheerfully said. “Though I would keep my weapons in hand, were I you.”

The hollows seemed as wary of them as the other way around, both sides eyeing each other until their group of five had passed the former slaves. The five of them hurried once they were clear, the hollows watching them go. Tupoc gestured for them to slow as soon as they had turned a corner.

“They also let us pass because they are heading for the battle,” the Izcalli said. “Their captain seems to believe that the Red Eye cult is winning.”

“Slaves and savages against a pack of devils?” Cozme skeptically said. “It will be a massacre even with the numbers on their side.”

“There are still sounds of fighting in the distance,” Maryam pointed out. “Something must be evening the scales for there to be no clear victor.”

“We saw the warband that is now attacking Cantica when we made our way here,” Tristan slowly said. “They had a priestess with them, a woman the other cultists seemed to fear.”

“Pacts with old gods are dangerous things,” Tupoc said, tone unusually serious. “That which has no restraint in price yields none in power.”

That last sentence had sounded oddly cadenced, likely a quote. They began moving north again, skirting the edge of town to get around the fighting in the middle, but soon ran into cultists against. One cultist, more specifically, marked with ritual scarification from head to toe and trying to harangue a group of cowering slaves hiding out in the garden behind a house into joining their way. He turned his anger and his spear their way, shouting in some cant, but whatever he might have been about to say was cut short.

Cozme shot him in the gut without missing a beat.

He blew the smoke off his pistol’s barrel as the slaves screamed in fear, some scattering while others flattened themselves behind rows of cabbage.

“That should have been bladework,” Tupoc tightly said. “Someone will have heard you.”

“There are shots all over town,” Cozme dismissed.

“But not from here,” Tristan said. “Let us pick up the pace before someone thinks to question that.”

He slid by Maryam as their strides quickened. She cocked an eyebrow his way and he wasted no time quietly filling her in on the bargain with Zenzele. She grimaced.

“I will not use a Sign on Tupoc,” she murmured. “It is too dangerous.”

He did not hide his surprise. She had not mentioned him to be dangerous in that regard before.

“That spear of his,” Maryam said, “I saw it go right through a devil’s carapace. I think the head is candlesteel.”

“I have never heard of it,” Tristan admitted.

“Izcalli will not reveal how they make it,” she said, “but supposedly it has something to do with their infamous candles. The material is death on aether – even the solid kind devils are made of – and it’s only marginally kinder to Gloam, so no Signs anywhere near him.”

Considering Leander Galatas had exploded his own arm when a Sign of his broke back on the Bluebell, that seemed wise.

“Any kind of distraction will do,” he whispered.

A moment of hesitation, then she nodded.

“I will not be sticking around,” Maryam informed him. “The moment they fight, I run.”

“I expected no less,” he said. “Besides-”

In the distance there was a burst of fire and light as a burning house collapsed, stopping them in their tracks as the brightness revealed a slice of nightmare near the town square. Screaming devils twined in red string were fighting against others of their kind while scarred cultists in a phalanx kept away more of the creatures from their wildly laughing priestess, whose hands seemed to direct the puppeteered devils. Steel and powder faced a tide of claws and ripped shells, more hollows with makeshift weapons streaming from all sides to throw themselves into the fight.

“You might have been right about taking the long away around,” Cozme conceded into the silence.

“Kind of you to say,” Tristan replied. “But let us-”

For the second time in less than a minute he was interrupted, again by the collapse of a house near the town square. Only that one had not been on fire a moment ago. With a faint whistling sound a second shell fell down, striking the melee at the heart of the town. The impact flattened a devil and turned three men to pulp.

Far to the north the night filled with light as the Watch’s cannons began raining down fire on Cantica.

Why would they, Tristan began to think, but before he finished the question he already had the answer. Maryam had told him that in Three Pines the Watch had some kind of Antediluvian wonder that could see things afar. Of course they had used it after the collapse of the mountain, and used it on Cantica in particular – it was where survivors would be heading. They must already know that the devils broke the terms and that the town was being conquered by the cult of the Red Maw.

The devils had been right, in a way: the Watch had written off the trial for this year. Only they’d been written off with it.

“We need to get out of this cursed town right now,” Cozme hissed.

“Everyone will be rushing to the postern gate now,” Tupoc calmly noted. “It is closest to the town square.”

Meaning going that way was certain death. And looming trouble for Angharad’s crew, if they used that side of the town to circle north towards the meeting point. Which he thought most likely, since the other group would be expecting them to leave through that same gate. That might well turn into a disaster, the thief thought, but it was not one he could do anything about.

“Straight to the front gate,” Tristan said.

The world went bright.

It was a heartbeat before Tristan realized he was on the ground, his ears ringing. The house ahead of him was a shattered, burning wreck and he threw up on the ground. He could barely focus his eyes as he crawled away, limbs trembling. Had he dropped something? His bag was still on his back, but… He saw silhouettes moving, someone helping him up. Maryam, he saw, looking worried.

“-r me?” she was asking. “Tristan?”

“Yeah,” he croaked. “That’s me.”

“You were lucky,” she said. “If that had hit ten feet to the right, you would be pulp.”

“Lucky,” he repeated, rasping out a laugh.

The others were… Tupoc was on his knees but pushing himself up. Cozme seemed fine, though he was looking strangely at Zenzele who… had his sword in hand as he moved behind the Izcalli.

“That,” Zenzele Duma coldly said, “will do.”

He rammed the blade into Tupoc’s back, but the pale-eyed man twisted at the last moment. It was a wound, not a kill, and with a laugh the Izcalli swatted Zenzele’s leg. They fell, wrestling. A curse, and Tristan watched with wide eyes as Cozme Aflor bolted. He cursed in turn, pushing himself off Maryam, and his eye caught a glint of light on metal. His pistol lay where he’d fallen, flames reflecting off it. 

Yong’s pistol, the last piece of the bridge had had burned.

Cozme was getting away, every breath furthering the distance.

His stomach clenched. Tristan looked at Maryam, found those blue eyes on him, and swallowed.

“Go,” she said. “Finish it. I will collect if we live.”

He licked his lips.

“You know where I’ll be,” he said.

And off he ran after Cozme, snatching Zenzele’s abandoned lantern as he went.

—

He ran through the nightmare, pursuing an older one.

Smoke and fire and screams, Cozme Aflor’s silhouette just far enough ahead with every breath he suffered the fear of losing him. The man was heading straight for the front gate, in as clean a line as he could, but the thief knew it would not work. Both devils and cultists would be heading for the postern to the west, but once one side had the clear advantage of that skirmish the losing one would be headed to the other way out.

To Tristan’s surprise, it proved to be the devils that lost out.

Cozme hastily stopped and slid behind a couple of barrels come loose from a pile as a pair of devils still in their corpses came running out of a larger street, bickering in Antigua as they ran for the front gate. Tristan saw the grimace on the older man’s face even before he slid down by his side. Cozme stiffened, hand reaching for his blade, but Tristan lay a finger on his lips. The older man bit the inside of his cheek, remembering that evils had uncanny hearing, and conceded with a curt nod.

They waited until the devils were out of sight.

“Why did you follow me, rat?” Cozme bit out when he finally felt safe.

A shell hit a few blocks to the east, both of them flinching as a house shattered.

“You think I want to be in the middle of that brawl?” Tristan replied. “I want out of this town place, Aflor.”

“Find your own way,” Cozme grunted.

“My way was the front gate, same as you,” Tristan replied, sounding impatient. “Only it won’t work, will it? It’ll be full of devils with the same bloody idea.”

Another shell fell, further away. They still tensed at the sound. Tristan licked his lips, made himself look nervous.

“Look, I might know a place to hide out away from the bombardment,” he said. “Found it with Xical and Tredegar.”

The mustachioed man stared at him.

“The underground gaol,” he said. “The one where you found first found the slaves.”

Tristan nodded.

“It should be empty now,” he said. “The cultists would have hit it first, those prisoners were sure recruits.”

Cozme slowly nodded, face never wavering, and a heartbeat later Tristan had a knife at his throat. Gods, he’d not even seen the other man unsheathing it. Groggy as he was from the shell earlier, that was sloppy of him.

“Why?” Cozme asked suspiciously. “Why run after me to share this and not simply go yourself?”

Tristan bit his lip, made himself look aside. Look how embarrassed I am, he thought.

“Because I can’t defend the place,” he said, feigning bitterness. “If cultists go there, or a devil-”

“They will trounce you,” the older man finished, sounding thoughtful. “And the foreign girl’s near as useless, it’s true, so she was not worth bringing along.”

A shell hit something a few blocks over, screams sounding out. Cozme took away the knife.

“All right,” he said. “Lead me to the gaol, Tristan.”

—

The place stank of mud and filth, but that was only to be expected.

It was large enough that the two of them could have a few feet between them, and through the open hatch half-covered by wood they could see the bombardment still lighting up the night. Until the Watch was done hammering away at Cantica, it would have been madness to leave their hiding place. Maryam should be headed this way as well, soon enough, so Tristan must end it before then.

He did not want his friend in the middle of this.

The bare stone room they sat in was about ten feet long and teen feet wide, a rough square, and there was nothing inside save for the open door leading into the deeper gaol full of shit and straw. Tristan had Zenzele’s lantern at his side, almost entirely shuttered so it could not draw attention.

Cozme still had his sword and knife, but no longer his musket and his pistol had not been loaded since he’d killed a cultist with it. Tristan himself was down to his blackjack and knife. He did have needles in his bag, but a subtle blow with them would be nigh impossible in a place like this.

Cozme Aflor was a fit man with two inches on Tristan, and though in his fifties the soldier was a hardened killer grown long in the tooth doing the dirty work of House Cerdan: in a straight fight Tristan would lose, and what could there be but a straight fight in a room of bare stone?

Fortunately, Tristan still had the last of Abuela’s gift. Two vials: bearded cat extract and medical turpentine.

He palmed his vial of bearded cat extract and quietly uncorked it, dripping the liquid into the shuttered lantern. The entire dose went in there, enough to drive a dozen men mad for an hour, but it would barely be enough for what he needed. The dose he could deliver by a needle or a knife would be too slow to act, but Alvareno’s Dosages was full of interesting notes about the substances it recommended for a poison box.

Like, for example, that when left near a source of heat for the correct amount of time bearded cat tincture turned into a kind of volatile smoke very sensitive to temperature. Tristan discreetly got rid of the empty vial and waited for Cozme to be looking up through the hatch to take off his tricorn. The other hand he kept on the lever that moved the shutters.

“Cozme,” he whispered.

The moment his enemy turned, he pulled the lever. The shutters opened and with the difference in temperature – hot in, cold out – white smoke came billowing out furiously. Tristan covered his face with his tricorn, throwing himself back, but still felt smoke lick at his skin in the few heartbeats before it dispersed. His skin grew red and welted wherever it was touched, the sensation deeply unpleasant.

It was probably why Cozme Aflor was screaming, as it’d gone right into his eyes.

Most of the mind-altering properties were lost when the extract was made into smoke – it caused barely a tingling sensation, instead of hallucinations and violent bouts of emotion – but it did become significantly more acid. Tossing aside his hat, Tristan found Cozme clutching at his eyes and palmed his blackjack, coming closer to aim a blow.

The man moved, though, and what should have been a hard strike on the side of the head instead caught his shoulder. Cozme reacted swiftly, grabbing his wrist and yanking Tristan forward. Keeping silent save for grunt of efforts, the thief wrestled with the old killer. An elbow hit his chin and he hissed in pain, striking at the flesh under Cozme’s ribs in retaliation, but then the mustachioed man headbutted him.

Vision swimming, Tristan rolled away only to hear the sound of a knife leaving the sheath. He kept rolling, Cozme blindly stabbing at the ground where he had just been, and grit his teeth. He’d heard Cozme beat a god in a knife-fight, out in the maze. Even with the other man blind he doubted he would win.

“I knew there was something off about, you little shit,” Cozme snarled. “Who was it that hired you, the Ruesta?”

Tristan drew further back and held his breath, but he knew that would not last long. The older man’s eyes were closed and cringing, but he might still be able to see some and the pain would pass. His gaze swept the room, finding it bare save for one thing. Swallowing, he bet on a gamble: Tristan threw his blackjack against the wall to Cozme’s left, and while the man struck blindly there darted to right. Where he snatched up the lantern, swinging the mass of forged iron Cozme’s head even as the man turned back his way.

It caught him right in the cheekbone, crunching most satisfyingly as Cozme Aflor dropped to the ground.

Oil went spilling, aflame, but hit only stone. It would keep. Tristan dropped the lantern, just carefully enough it wouldn’t spill, and kicked the knife out of Cozme’s hand as the man lay moaning on the ground. He kicked the man in the stomach, making him curl, and took his sword out of the sheath before tossing into the other room.

In the distance, the fires of the blackcloak artillery burned.

Tristan went about it methodically. Boot coming down he broke the right knee, the older man screaming hoarsely. Then he broke the left arm, at the elbow. That should be enough to prevent Cozme overpowering him. Finally baring his own knife, he sat on the man’s chest and rested the blade against this throat.

“Fool,” Cozme croaked. “The bitch is dead, do you really think the Ruesta will still pay you?”

“I have no agreement with House Ruesta,” Tristan said. “Our business, Cozme Aflor, is much older than that.”

The man blinked, eyes red and tearing.

“Who are you?” Cozme rasped.

“My name,” he coldly said, “is Tristan Abrascal.”

It had been years, more than a decade, but still the old killer remembered. It barely took him a moment. Tristan might have cut him, if not for that.

“The violinist,” Cozme said. “Tomas Abrascal, gods. You’re the son.”

“I am the boy who was hiding under a table when you put a bullet in his father’s head,” Tristan told him. “He’d been so strange, those last few weeks. Mother kept crying and I worried, thought he might sick. So I followed him, thinking as children do that I would protect him.”

Cozme rasped out a laugh.

“Manes,” he said. “He was close to losing it, so we brought him in through the trap door.  There weren’t any guards in that house – you saw that fucking slaughterhouse, didn’t you?”

If Tristan lived to be five hundred years, he would not forget what he had seen down there. Children in pieces, strapped to stables and hooked to copper wires. Barrels of limbs, pools of blood. Men with more parts sown on than not and that… thing held up in the air by golden chains so no part of it could touch the ground.

“I told them a second entrance was a terrible idea,” Cozme said, “but Ceferin insisted. We couldn’t keep bringing people in through the warehouse, people would ask questions.”

“Theogony,” Tristan said. “That’s what you four called it, when you had your little talk. What were you doing down there, Cozme? What was it all for?”

“I don’t know, kid,” Cozme tiredly said. “I just ran the guards, Ceret was the one with the grand plans. They put me in charge of finding Murk folk who already had contract, then Lord Lorent introduced them to the Almsgiver.”

Tristan stilled, for at long last he had the fifth name on his list. The name of the god that had its filthy hands all over this butchery, that had contracted with his father knowing it would kill him.

“The god that gave out the contracts, this Almsgiver,” he said. “Was it a Mane, Cozme?”

“I don’t know,” Cozme replied, too quickly.

“Tell me,” the thief hissed.

The older man laughed, only laughing harder when Tristan pressed his knife harshly against his throat.

“You’re going to kill me anyway, Abrascal,” Cozme said. “Your threats mean nothing.”

Tristan slashed through his eyes, the man screaming and struggling. Cozme was stronger, but blind and in pain. It was not a straight fight.

“Pain always means something, Cozme,” Tristan replied. “Tell me.”

“I don’t fucking know, kid,” the older man rasped. “I was just ran the guards.”

Whether that was true or not he could not tell, but he sensed he would get no more out of Cozme. A dead end, but he was not yet out of questions.

“You were there when they closed it down,” Tristan said. “Moved out. Where did they go, Cozme? Where are they butchering children now?”

“Somewhere out in the Trebian Sea,” Cozme laughed. “I never asked. Never cared. I’d paid my dues, I was on the rise.”

“Not for long,” Tristan thinly smiled.

Else he would not have been send to the Dominion of Lost Things, risking life and limb for favor.

“Never for long,” the man said. “That’s the way, isn’t it?”

The thief’s lips thinned.

“Do you even regret any of it?” he asked.

Cozme snorted.

“I lived like a lord for years,” he said. “Rich, respected. I might even have married into a good family, if I hadn’t got cocky at the end. Regrets, Abrascal?”

He was laughing.

“You think you’re the only one with mud on your shoes, rat? Regrets, gods.”

The blinded man offered a red, ruinous smile.

“The hungry bite,” Cozme Aflor rasped, “the beggared snatch, the cornered-”

Tristan twisted, cut his throat before he could finish the words. He watched the man gurgle, blood spill out, and said not a word as his father’s executioner died. Father, he had been half-mad at the end. One eye gone yellow, a leg growing warped. It had been a mercy in some way, what Cozme did, and for that Tristan did not make his death slow.

But he did not make it quick either.

And only when the gurgling ended, when Cozme went still and his began to stiffen, did he finally tear his eyes away.

“Three,” Tristan softly counted.

May his father be spun smiling by the Circle into his next life.

He sat by the corpse, silent, waiting for Maryam to join him – perhaps with Zenzele, if the man still lived. And when he closed his eyes, when he thought of the sound of that trigger being pulled and Father’s brains splattering the floor mere inches away from his little feet, of the way he had bit his lip until it bled so he’d not make a sound, the scales felt slightly closer to even.

“Laurent Cerdan,” he whispered into the dark. “Lauriana Ceret. Ceferin.”

All old names, worn from the speaking. And now there was one more to add.

“The Almsgiver,” he tried out.

It sounded, Tristan thought, like a promise.

# Chapter 44

The woods around Cantica had been cleared, leaving no true cover close to the palisade.

The five of them instead gathered around a half-abandoned firepit about thirty feet out, roughly to the west of the town. It had a rack propped up over it that Ferranda said was for smoking meat, and they all felt a little sick at the thought of what kind of meat that might mean. Devils were said to prefer eating men whilst they lived, but they were not above feasting on corpses. Regardless of that understated horror, the pause was most welcome. They were all tired and out of breath, in stark need of reprieve.

Not that it was only that, for now that the enemy was out of sight Angharad’s oaths were put to the question.

“This was badly done, Tredegar,” Shalini bit out. “You-”

“She didn’t promise a thing, Goel,” Lan cut in. “Our good lordling swore to return me unharmed, yeah?”

The Tianxi pointed at the cut on her neck.

“He let her out of the oath before he even agreed to it.”

Eyes turned to her and Angharad shrugged.

“I expected him to catch the detail and amend the wording,” she admitted. “I agreed because the oath was easy to negate regardless: we could simply warn the Watch that one of the trial-takers feigned their death, then point at every other deceased from the Bluebell manifest and specify it was not them.”

So long as Augusto was not outright named, the oath was not broken.

“Huh,” Shalini finally said. “He’s the one who asked for that wording, I’m surprised he didn’t think of that.”

“He was on edge,” Lan told them. “Even more than you’d think. He kept talking to himself and the cultists avoided being anywhere near him.”

“I do not think his contract did heal him,” Song said, and that earned instant attention.

Angharad knew more about the Tianxi’s pact than most, but by now most everyone had figured out that those silver eyes gave her insight into the workings of spirits.

“The Red Eye, it is a god of feeding,” she continued. “When Felis bargained with it his wound was not healed, he closed it with some sort of red crystal that fed on his body. Why would Augusto Cerdan get a better bargain, when he would have bargained from even worse a position?”

“He had a hole through his body, Song,” Ferranda flatly said. “He no longer does.”

“I don’t think that’s actually true,” the Tianxi replied. “I think that his wounds are still there but that he can fill them up – but that, like the Red Eye, he must keep feeding for them to stay filled.”

Lan let out a low whistle.

“So the old god’s a loan shark,” she said. “Our boy Augusto has to keep what, eating human flesh so what grew back doesn’t whither? No wonder he thinks the Watch will blow his brains out if they catch him.”

“Something like that,” Song agreed. “I imagine his pact lends him a way to feed at a touch, if the cultists feared coming close.”

“We should take care to avoid getting close to him, then,” Angharad said.

“You say that like you are not planning to kill him before night’s end,” Ferranda said. “Though I will admit I am not sure how you would get around the terms.

“That oath does seem pretty straightforward,” Shalini agreed, cocking an eyebrow. “Tredegar?”

The terms were simple enough, that was true. She was to commit no violence against Augusto Cerdan nor allow her companions to do the same, or attempt to imprison him nor allow her companions to do the same, until twenty four hours had passed. Only he had not though to anchor the oath in-

In the distance, the night lit up with thunder.

No, she realized. Not thunder. These were cannons. And the shattering cacophony inside Cantica revealed exactly what they were being turned on, sowing fire and screams. The five of them went still, like rabbits before a wolf, as bombardment began in earnest from north of the town. Where they had been headed.

“Those are guchui rounds,” Song finally spoke into the silence.

Shalini breathed in sharply.

“Thunder shells?” she said. “I thought the Republics kept a tight lid on those.”

“They sell them to the Watch,” Lan said, with strange certainty. “Sometimes the crates are kept in Sacromonte warehouses until they can be distributed to the right Garrison force.”

Angharad could feel the capital letter on Garrison, even in Antigua. It was not unwarranted, for though the free companies of the Watch made up the majority of its numbers the ruling council of the blackcloaks, the Conclave, commanded the single largest number of soldiers in black cloaks. They must, to protect their Trebian territories and uphold their duties under the Iscariot Accords.

The soldiers of the Garrison were considered second-rate compared to the more glamourous company men, Angharad knew, but that only meant so much. Getting bit by a hound instead of a wolf was hardly kinder on the hand.

It occurred to the noblewoman a moment later that Lan, given her unseemly origins, might well be so certain because she had participated in robbing the Watch. It was somewhat embarrassing it had taken her so long to catch that, but for all the woman’s Sacromontan quirks she had to admit that Lan did not act much like she had imagined a criminal would. She was clean and well-spoken, not constantly drunk and disorderly, and as far as Angharad could tell she was not constantly lying.

It would be a stretch to call her an honorable woman, but Angharad would hesitate to say she was even half as detestable as the likes of Augusto Cerdan, to whom she had once so thoughtlessly granted the presumption of honor.

“If the Watch is shelling Cantica, it’ll be to soften up the opposition before they storm it,” Shalini said. “That means they have troops on the way, probably come from Three Pines.”

“Which means we could take refuge with them if we head north,” Lady Ferranda said. “That seems the wisest course left open to us.”

“That path takes us by the postern gate,” Angharad said. “The others will be trying to evacuate through there, it seems to me we could attempt to join up on the way.”

She had expected to have to fight some of the others for this, particularly Shalini and Ferranda, but they found the two quite agreeable to the suggestion. Zenzele is still with the others, she realized after a moment. It was Lan that objected, though in words carefully coached to give no offense.

“I do not mean to linger overlong,” Angharad assured her. “Only to ascertain if we might bolster our numbers on the way north.”

“There will be a lot of rats trying to leave that sinking ship, Lady Tredegar,” Lan warned her. “We’re just as likely to run into enemies as friends.”

It was true, she knew, but yet worth trying. As everyone save Lan shared her opinion, there was no further debate and they headed out briskly. Cantica was not so large that it would take long to get past the town, and they were already on the right side to reach the postern gate anyhow. It was but the work of minutes to make their way there on yellow grass, weapons out and eyes wary. The postern gate was carefully hidden from the outside, made to look part of the palisade, but their crew had the advantage of having Song among it so Angharad hardly worried of finding it.

Even that hardly proved unnecessary, as there was no missing the gate when they got there: it was wide open.

Eyes sweeping their surroundings, Angharad found nothing but an expanse of empty yellow grass from the edge of the woods to their west and the palisade to their east. The open grounds continued to the north in a wide curve until they reached the continuation of the beaten earth road leading to the port of Three Pines. Inside the town, past the palisade, they could hear the roar of flames and the occasional shot as the Watch’s bombardment continued to methodically demolish Cantica.

“They might have left it open after Augusto let them in,” Lady Ferranda said.

“Smells like ambush,” Shalini grunted back, shaking her head.

“No sign of our companions,” Lan said. “We should move on.”

Angharad hesitated. She liked the look of this no more than Shalini, but an empty field was no reason to leave behind comrades. They could at least-

“Movement,” Song suddenly said, musket rising.

Only she was not looking at the open gate, Angharad realized, but the woods.

From which a cultist warband was charging out.

—

He wasn’t sure how long he sat there in the dark, with only a shuttered lantern with company, but it was a relief when someone craned their neck past the edge of the trap door.

“I hope you’re down there, because if you aren’t I’m going to have to drop him and I’m not sure he’ll live,” Maryam called out.

“Please do not,” Zenzele Duma croaked. “I will most definitely die.”

Huh, he thought as he got on his feet. The Malani had lived, fancy that.

“I’ll admit,” Tristan called back, “even opening with a sword in the back, I figured Tupoc would kill you.”

“Stop taunting him and help me get him down that ladder,” Maryam said. “The last shell hit just a few blocks away, I do not care to stay out here.”

He opened the lantern’s shutters and moved to lend a hand as had been requested. And a hand was most definitely needed, for Zenzele Duma looked as if he had been thrown down a hill made of blades. He no longer bore his coat and his shirt was ripped clean through, revealing a nasty gut wound as well as a deep cut that went from the side of his torso to right below the hollow of his neck. Tristan thought one of his arms might be broken as well, for he used only one to move down the ladder, but found it was truly because the Malani was cradling something in his hand.

It was only when Zenzele turned to be helped down the last rungs that the thief saw the worst wound of them all: his right eye had been ripped through, roughly enough it must be the work of nails and not a blade. Tristan swallowed.

“Not a pretty sight, is it?” Zenzele weakly laughed. “And I did not even kill the bastard while he might well have killed me, had cultists not come looking because of Cozme’s shot. That and Lady Sarai’s priceless help, of course.”

“Call me Maryam,” she said as she came down the ladder, closing the trapdoor behind her. “I suppose that game has finally run its course.”

She glanced at the Malani, not harshly but without much kindness either.

“And it was luck on your part, Duma. If I hadn’t run into them myself I wouldn’t have doubled back and found you lying there.”

Tristan helped the man to lower himself and sit against the wall, still clutching something in his hand.

“Try stabbing the head first, next time,” Tristan advised. “Works better than the back.”

Zenzele convulsed, letting out a ragged wheezing sound.

“Sleeping God, Tristan, don’t make me laugh,” he said. “I think it makes my inside bleed.”

The thief mercifully spared him further amusement, finding Maryam looking at him with a raised eyebrow.

“I did get something from him, yes,” Zenzele muttered, seeming to talk to no one in particular. “He will remember it.”

And the dark-skinned man finally loosened his grip, smiling as he revealed the eye on the palm of his hand. It was cut up and red, but Tristan had seen that eerie paleness often enough to recognize it. That was Tupoc Xical’s eye, he was sure of it. Zenzele murmured unintelligibly after that, staring at nothing as he sagged against the stone.

“He dips in and out of things,” Maryam said. “I don’t suppose you have anything left for pain?”

“Clean out,” Tristan said. “I can clean some of his wounds and bandage them, at least.”

“Please do,” she said.

Blue eyes moved to the corner, where the shadows half-cloaked Cozme’s body. Zenzele had been too out of it to notice.

“Did you get what you wanted?” Maryam quietly asked.

“From him? Enough.”

In the pale lantern light, the sharp cast and colors of her hardly seemed a woman’s – like sapphires cast in marble, too angular to have been born and not carved.

“But did you get what you want?” she asked again.

He breathed out.

“It is not finished,” he said. “There are four others left before the account is settled.”

She sighed.

“I suppose it was too much to hope you would be done with it,” Maryam said. “Will you try for Augusto?”

Tristan shrugged.

“The Watch will have him marked for death,” he said. “I see no pressing need to pull the trigger myself.”

“So you can be taught,” she drily said. “Promising.”

The thief licked his lips, unsure of what he had to say but certain of the need for it.

“Before,” he said. “When I left you behind, I-”

“I do not care for apologies,” Maryam told him. “I have… I understand the demands the past can make, let us leave it at that. If your actions bring you sorrow, Tristan, do not repeat them. The past is a dead thing.”

He passed a hand through his hair, feeling so very tired.

“I’ll not excuse or justify,” Tristan finally said. “But when I go for the second name, it will be in a manner that does not lead me to regrets.”

She studied him for a moment.

“My mother always said that no amount of regrets will built a cairn, but she was a hard woman,” Maryam said. “Too hard, in some ways. It was why her men gave her up to the Malani at the end.”

He hardly dared breathe, for never before had Maryam spoken a word of her past.

“It matters, that you regret it,” she said. “But only so much. Remember that, next time you stand at that same crossroads.”

The pale woman reached for her bag, claiming something inside, and offered it to him. Even in this trembling light, Tristan could not mistake it for anything else: Yong’s pistol, the grip held towards him. The same he’d left in the mud when he ran after Cozme.

The rat swallowed, licking his cracked lips.

“You picked it up,” he dumbly said.

Maryam pressed it into his palms, closed his fingers around it.

“Once,” she warned.

—

Before Angharad could so much as open her mouth, Lan fled.

Back the same way they had come: straight south, as fast as her legs could carry her. The noblewoman hesitated then moved to join her, looking at the others. Song caught her by the shoulder.

“We have to go back in the town,” she said. “Now.”

Angharad gaped. There was bravery and then there was foolishness. If everyone was fleeing Cantica, then there might be devils headed for that very postern gate right now. She was not the only to think this madness. The cultists were gaining on them, even if they were still far out. At least a dozen of them, all running.

“That’s going to get us killed,” Shalini said. “Every second we are not running south we-”

A shot rang out and they all flinched.

“Into the town,” Song hissed. “They have muskets, we can’t stay in the open.”

Heart in her throat, Angharad turned and saw exactly what she feared: Lan was on the ground. It was her the cultists had been aiming at. She was still moving, struggling to get up, but the shot had clearly hit here.

“Don’t you dare,” Song began, but she was already running.

She glimpsed ahead and banked hard to the left to avoid getting shot in the gut, Song putting a bullet in the shooter’s head a heartbeat later. Her legs burned but she ran, glimpsing again. She had to slide low, boots ripping into dead grass to avoid another shot. Song was reloading, could not silence the enemy twice in such quick succession.

Lan turned to her, her side bleeding, and got on her knees. Angharad scrambled back up, glimpsing again, and saw the shot before it happened.

“Du-”

The bullet took Lan in the cheek, as if some invisible maw bit through flesh and bone, and it was mercy the impact spun her around. What little of that death Angharad had just seen she would not soon forget.

“-ck,” she finished, nauseous.

“Come back, you damn fool,” Song snarled.

They were going for the door, all three of them, but only Shalini had her eyes on it. Song and Ferranda had their muskets out and were firing at the cultists, covering her still. Three of the warband had split off to go after her, Angharad saw, but she was faster. Her legs were longer. She left them behind, the one who came closest shot in the leg by Ferranda, and Song slew another hollow musketman without batting an eye.

She caught up to them just as they got to the open postern gate, hollows close on her heels. Shalini was ushering them one after another, eyes calm. Angharad passed her, feeling a hand pat her back, and the Someshwari moved so quickly after that she barely even caught it. A heartbeat, then smoked billowed and Shalini had two pistols in hand.

Two cultists dropped dead, the others tripping into them, and the Someshwari slammed the door behind them. She locked it after as Angharad stumbled forward, panting from the fear and run and the companion she had failed to protect. If she had been just a little faster, cut it closer with the shot she had slid to avoid… Ferranda squeezed her shoulder.

“You tried,” the infanzona said. “Eyes up, Angharad. We’re not out of trouble yet.”

She swallowed, shaking off the other woman, but a look around told her that Ferranda Villazur had the right of it.

They were not out of trouble yet, for before the mud of Cantica’s streets was filled with corpses.

The sight of that silent spread of death filled her with more dread than the sound of cultists trying to jostle the postern gate open behind them, slamming fists against the wood and unloading their muskets. It was not the bombardment that had done this, they could all see it plain. The heaps of hollows and devils had been killed the hard way, cracked and cut and pierced. Some devils looked like their torso had been pulped, the remains disgusting to behold.

“Manes,” Ferranda breathed out. “What did this?”

In the distance there was a shrill scream, the sound of it like walking on broken glass. They all flinched.

“Whatever it was, it is no longer here,” Song said. “Best to get gone before it returns.”

In the distance, another shell lit up the dark as it hit Cantica. The bombardment was tapering down, but it was not yet done.

“We need to leave this town,” Angharad said, then sighed. “Again.”

“The main gates, then,” Shalini said. “I don’t think our friends outside are going to be letting us pass through.”

As if to agree with her, a cultist unloaded into the door again. Not that muskets would help any there, Angharad thought.  The door was thick, solid wood. Odd that they would waste powder on it when that was plain to see.

“I see no better plan to be had,” Song finally said. “Ferranda?”

“Sounds better than joining them,” the infanzona said, nodding at the corpses.

They set out as quickly and quietly as they could. The fastest path would be south of the main street, but that was too likely to find them a fight. They kept two streets off instead, even if would take them longer with all the detours. Much of the town was on fire, now, and they hardly needed a lantern to seen. It was why Angharad saw him at the same time he saw them.

Walking down the street alone, humming, Mayor Crespin had not a mark on him save for some ash on his clothes. Even his shell was pristine, knuckles barely scuffed though there was some blood around his mouth and under his fingernails. The four of them slowed at the sight of him, Ferranda quietly cursing. Angharad’s lips thinned. There was no fire on this part of the street, only dark and empty houses with tiled roofs on both sides.

“I don’t like the look of that fight,” Shalini admitted.

They would, Angharad suspected, have a choice of whether or not it was to be fought. Before she could call out, the approaching devil broke the silence.

“You returned,” Mayor Crespin said, sounding baffled. “Why – nay, it matters not. Let us put an end to our pointless palaver. Cantica has breathed its last, I must make arrangement.”

Angharad’s jaw tightened.

“I will get close,” she said. “Try to get shots in, pinning him is our best chance.”

“Your best,” Crespin replied, revealing rows and rows of teeth, “is not enough.”

There was a sharp whistling sound, a for a moment Angharad hoped a shell was falling. Instead the devil’s hand reared up, catching what she realized was a stone. Polished and the size of a small fist, but very much a stone. The devil let out an amused noise.

“A slinger?” he said, tossing the stone behind him. “How nostalgic.”

He was looking up at the roof to their side, and Angharad followed his gaze. There was a man up there, in a black cloak. She caught a glimpse of Aztlan features under the cloak, then the watchman raised a hand. He snapped his fingers and there was sudden buzzing sound.

Mayor Crespin’s arm down to the elbow, the same that’d caught the stone, was pulped.

The devil screamed, legs ripping free from his shell like it were paper, but liquid darkness formed a circle with something inside it just above his head. Angharad’s gaze shied away from the Sign, even as the devil turned limp for a heartbeat. A heartbeat was all it took, for another blackcloak emerged from the dark of an alley behind the mayor. They bore a long spear – no, a harpoon. The head was barbed.

The Sign above the devil dissolved a heartbeat before the harpoon went into his back.

Crespin screamed and struggled but the watchman danced away. The harpoon did not move, however, as if stuck in the air, and the devil was stuck on it.

“All yours, lieutenant,” the blackcloak said.

A woman, Angharad caught. There was a Tianxi lilt to her words. The slinger above chuckled, taking his time to place another stone on a leather strap at the end of a rope and swing it. The stone hit the devil in its head this time, despite Crespin’s desperate struggles. The lieutenant snapped his fingers and buzzing sound returned, even louder.

A heartbeat later, the devi’s torso was black mulch and Angharad swallowed, unsure whether she felt disgust or awe.

“Impressive, isn’t it?”

The noblewoman nearly leapt out of her skin, reaching for her saber until she found a knife lazily pressed against her throat. There was a fourth blackcloak next to her, and from the shouts of the others they had just noticed it as well. How? They had been in the middle of the alley.

“Don’t think too hard on it, Tredegar,” the blackcloak teased as they drew back the blade, face hidden under the hood. “You might sprain something.”

“You know who I am?” she got out.

“I read the docket for the recommended,” the watchman said. “Headed for the Skiritai, is it? You’ll have to work on your awareness, else they might decide you need to be taught.”

“I will,” Angharad slowly said, “keep that in mind… sir?”

“Sir will work,” the watchman said. “The four of you surviving should count as a Trial of Weeds complete, given the circumstances. Congratulations in advance.”

“The Watch is already inside the town?” Song asked. “You are still shelling it.”

The Aztlan with the sling, the one the other had called lieutenant, leapt down from the roof and landed in the mud with a wet squelch.

“Not the regulars, girl, just us,” he said. “We are cleaning house with the worst of the lot before the palisade is breached and the proper sweep begins.”

There was another of those ear-splitting screams in the distance.

“Enough chitchat,” the lieutenant grunted. “Chameli is taking too long with the Saint.”

“There’s a Saint here?” Ferranda asked, sounding worried.

“The priestess leading the warband pulled a little too deep,” the watchman that had put a knife to her throat said. “Useful in cleaning up the devils, but she’s a feeder. Those are always tricky to kill.”

Song cleared her throat.

“Lieutenant,” she said, “I understand that you have a charge, but if one of your squads could spare-”

The blackcloak with the harpoon, who had just ripped it out of the mayor’s remains, let out a snort.

“Crews?” she said. “There’s only us, girl. The commander knew it’d be excessive force already.”

“Five of you,” Angharad slowly said. “Five of you did what we saw at the entrance?”

“It was getting boring in Three Pines,” the lieutenant shrugged. “It’s good to stretch our legs now and then.”

That hadn’t been what – the chatty one she had called sir clapped her shoulder, overly friendly.

“I would recommend hiding out in the west of town until it’s over,” they said. “We already cleaned it up. Don’t go through the main gates.”

“Why?” Angharad asked.

“The regulars set up a killing field there,” the lieutenant said. “They’ll shoot on sight.”

He whistled sharply afterwards, striding away without another word. The harpooner followed, and the Navigator had never come out in the first place.

“Good luck,” the chatty one said waving back as he followed, walking backwards. “Try not to die, I have coin riding on you and Duma making it to the end!”

The four of them were left there standing in the street, as if a storm had just blown through. Sleeping God, Angharad thought, remembering the carper of corpses. Five of them. Shalini cleared her throat.

“West, then?” she tried.

It seemed a sounder notion than being shot by their own rescuers, at least.

“I know a place,” Angharad said.

—

By the time Tristan finished seeing to Zenzele’s wounds the Malani was alert again.

Pain was a fine enough anchor, and there was only so gentle the thief could be when cleaning wounds that serious. He was thanked, afterwards, and that courtesy extended to the young lord pretending he could not see Cozme’s corpse in the corner of the room. Tristan had considered throwing in the gaol in the back, but Zenzele had already known what he intended and could out him for it should he wish.

It had also been pretty funny to watch the Malani have to pretend there wasn’t a dead man a couple of feet away from him, which might have weighed on his decision more than was strictly wise.

“The shelling has stopped,” Maryam noted. “I expect the Watch will assaulting the town soon.”

“Now would be the time to get out, if we do not want to be stuck between the hollows and the rooks,” Tristan agreed. “Lord Zenzele, would you feel up to the trip?”

The man hesitated.

“If you help me,” he finally said. “We risk cultists coming here to hide if we stay much longer anyhow, and I mean no insult but I do not be believe we would prevail in such an encounter.”

Tristan, who had over the last few days been savagely beaten not once but twice by greyhairs, saw no grounds to argue that point. He was honestly unsure if Lord Zenzele might not be the best fighter of them still even in his state.

“We could take on one hollow,” Maryam firmly said.

“Two, if they’re children,” Tristan added.

Zenzele convulsed again, breath wheezing.

“What did I say,” he gasped, “about making me laugh?”

It was more laborious than difficult getting him out of the gaol after that, Maryam heading up to drag him by the shoulders while Tristan stood below to push him up by the waist. The thief got out with the lantern in hand while Zenzele leaned against Maryam for support.

“Should I ask what happened to Cozme Aflor?” the Malani lord casually asked.

“Lost him in the chaos,” Tristan just as casually replied. “Who knows? He might have fallen down some stairs.”

“Very sharp stairs indeed,” Zenzele muttered, and asked no more.

Large swaths of the town were on fire, but the southern part – close to the main gates – seemed to have been the least ravaged by the bombardment. To Tristan that reeked of leaving a hole in the barrel so you knew where the water would go, even more so when he risked climbing atop a half-wrecked house and stood on the roof to have a look at the rest of Cantica. There was a hole in the palisade to the north of the town and the Watch seemed to be sweeping towards the south street by street.

He climbed down to tell them as much and Zenzele grimaced.

“They are driving the hollows out into the open grounds to the south,” the Malani said. “They must already have men in place there, they left a path out so they will not have to dig them up street by street.”

“That will become good news in a while,” Tristan said, “but until then it means that every surviving hollow and devil in Cantica is being driven our way.”

A heartbeat passed.

“We could go back in the hole,” Maryam reluctantly said.

Zenzele Duma looked as if he did not know whether to laugh or cry.

“That would be even riskier than we thought,” Tristan said. “It’s a good place to ride out the Watch sweep, and there’s former slaves with the cultists. At least some of them will know the place.”

“Heading towards the gate would be worse,” Maryam said. “Everyone else will be doing the same.”

“We could try to hide-”

“Stop,” Zenzele hoarsely whispered. “We need to hide right now.”

His eyes were wide but clear, and though he was looking at thin air that did not necessarily mean he was raving. Tristan caught Maryam’s gaze and nodded, the two of them helping the Malani limp towards the back of the piles of lumber.

“Quick, he’s close now,” the lord said.

“Who?” Maryam asked.

“Augusto Cerdan,” Zenzele replied. “Black chords for all three of us, he wants – needs, maybe? – us dead.”

That, Tristan thought, sounded like a very useful contract. He’d not even said anything and still he found Fortuna sitting on a roof and glaring down at him as he helped lead Zenzele into a small dead-end alley behind the wood piles. He sneered back at her. If she did not want him to have contract envy, then perhaps she should have offered better goods.

It was a very expressive sneer, as proved by his goddess’ outraged cry.

While the thief had no great love for dead-end alleys, it was the best they could do as a hiding place in a hurry and if it came to running it was likely Zenzele was dead anyway. The two of them lowered him behind a barrel of dirty rainwater, his back to it so his legs wouldn’t stick out, and the thief handed Maryam the lantern so she could shutter it. Just in time, as they all heard urgently speaking voices approach.

“It’s close to here, I swear,” a woman’s voice said in Antigua.

Tristan crept to the edge of the alley, crouching low, and risked a look. Five people had come from the west of Cantica, and though he could only make them out partly through the gap in wood piles the thief saw enough. Three armed and scarred men, cultists. A fair-haired woman in rags and badly bruised, likely a former slave.

And, as Zenzele had warned, Augusto Cerdan.

“It had better be,” Augusto said. “If you wasted our time, perhaps it will lead to our deaths – but I assure you, it will lead to yours first.”

Ah, infanzones. How lucky for the rest of Vesper that they now got to experience their particular charms.

“My brother helped dig it,” the woman insisted. “We’ll have to crawl, but it gets us past the palisade.”

Tristan stilled. Some kind of tunnel out? No, anything that large would have been noticed. More a crevice to squeeze through, likely widened as discreetly as the slaves could. While the thief would have preferred it should that crew be headed for the gaol – it would have been child’s play to lock them up inside – he would settle for them showing him a way out of this town. A glance back showed him that Zenzele was safely tucked away behind the barrel and Maryam doing her best to hide herself behind him.

There was hardly anywhere for him to hide even were he inclined to try, it was better to move.

Tristan crept away silently, moving behind one of the wood piles. The hollows had no lantern but one of them did hold a torch, which he kept high while the sole woman among them began patting away the bottom of the palisade past the lumberyard. Careful to position himself so someone wandering in from the north of the town, the thief settled in to wait them out. They hardly seemed to be paying attention to their surroundings, but that did not mean they were not dangerous.

One of the cultists said something to Augusto, too low for Tristan to overhear, and the infanzon gestured impatiently at him.

“So go and piss, then,” the Cerdan bit out. “And do it out of my sight, none of us need to see whatever tumor passes for your cock.”

The other two cultists laughed, speaking quickly in a cant. The tone, though, was universal. They were making fun of the third, and not nicely. The cultists stomped away angrily, scowling, and that was their luck turned. Because when Tristan realized the man was headed their way he was able to move around the wood pile and keep himself out of the sight, but the moment the cultists saw there was an alley he headed straight there.

And hollows saw better in the dark, so he was sure to see Maryam even if he missed Zenzele.

Fuck, Tristan thought, palming his blackjack. Even if he took out the man before he could shout, the others would notice in short order. They’d have to grab Zenzele and flee immediately, else they would be forced into a fight they were sure to lose. Augusto alone might have been enough to kill them, with that brutal contract of his, throwing in warriors too was smothering all hope. Biding his time, the thief circled entirely around the wood pile as the cultist walked past it and ended up at the man’s back.

Grunting as he approached the alley, the man propped his spear against the side of the shed at the corner and reached for his trousers. Tristan followed, steps silent and arm raised, as the cultist reached the alley and-

“Found it!”

And it all went to the dogs. The cultist turned to look back, catching Tristan with his hand raised, and the thief struck but it was already too late. The man got off half a shout before the blackjack his the side of his head, and he moved with the hit besides. Dazed but not unconscious. Cursing, the thief struck down at the crown of his head but the hollow got his hands up in time and tackled him. They rolled on the ground even as the cultists shouted out in cant.

“Move,” Maryam growled.

Obeying half on instinct, Tristan elbowed the cultist and threw himself off. A heartbeat later Maryam impaled the man with his own spear, right in the belly. The thief scrambled to his feet, looking back at the others as she coldly finished off the dying man, and saw trouble. The other two cultists were headed their way, Augusto elbowing them aside to take the lead.

“Is that you, rat?” he called out.

“We need to draw them away,” Tristan murmured to Maryam. “They might miss Zenzele.”

She nodded.

“Lord Augusto,” Tristan called out, smiling winningly. “What a coincidence to run into you here. Why, I was hoping-”

“Take him alive,” Augusto ordered the cultists. “Unless you’d prefer me topping off on one of you.”

Neither men look pleased at the threat, but they were more fearful than angry.

“It seems we got off on the wrong foot,” Tristan said, edging away from the alley. “I shall, uh, leave you to your business. Good luck you, my lord.”

Maryam raised the spear, which she seemed to have some training in using, and withdrew with him as the hollows approached. Both were armed, and no doubt better fighters. It’d be best to run now, it would also get them running after without first looking-

A strangled, coughing last came from the alley and Tristan almost cursed. There was no way the cultists had missed that, Zenzele was good as dead.

“You fool,” he hissed. “What was so funny it was worth slitting your own throat?”

“They’re all fucked,” Zenzele croaked back.

A heartbeat later a shot took the lead cultists in the throat, blood spattering wood, and the other one barely had the time to turn before death was on him. He thrust his spear but Angharad Tredegar pivoted around the blow like they were dancing, arm striking out like she knew where his neck was going to be an entire second before it got there. The cultists’ head fell on the floor, his body staying upright for a moment after, and the mirror-dancer did not even stop moving.

Just like that, easy as snuffing out a candle.

“You again,” Augusto snarled, stepping back in fear. “You got out, what are you doing-”

“That is none of your concern,” the Pereduri replied.

She was not alone. Shalini and Ferranda stood by her side, and by that perfect shot earlier Song must not be far either. Had Lan ditched them? Likely, if they’d gone back into the town. She was too clever a rat to let herself be talked into that. Feeling rather outnumbered, the infanzon cast a look around and found the same thing Tristan had just noticed: the woman left while they were all distracted. Whether she’d found her crevice or just legged it he had no idea, but good on her.

Wisest thing anyone had done all night.

“I am still protected by your oath,” Augusto called out. “You and all your companions, even those two. If you try to imprison me, you reveal yourself without-”

“Get on with it, Lord Augusto,” Tredegar said. “Your voice irritates, I must admit.”

Tristan’s hand went for his pistol, Yong’s pistol, but something about the pleasantness on Tredegar’s face stopped him. She did not usually feign a good mood, when denied something, and they all knew she badly wanted Augusto Cerdan dead. Instead he stepped forward, up to her side, and waited to let this play out.

It did not feel like a done thing, not yet.

—

Angharad watched as Augusto Cerdan slunk away, smirking, and wondered what he even thought he might achieve by going towards the palisade. Ultimately, she did not care enough to ask. Glancing at the Sacromontan who had just joined her, she inclined her head in a greeting he returned.

“Tristan,” she said. “I believe you own a pocket watch. Might I borrow it?”

The Sacromontan eyed her curiously, but he nodded and fished out the piece. It was simple but lovely work, Angharad found, polished bronze that popped open with ease. She marked the position of the needles, the lateness of the hour. It was four fifteen past midnight. The Pereduri delicately pushed the hour needle forward, all the way around the watch twice until it came to rest at four fifteen again. Nodding her thanks at Tristan, she handed him back his watch as he watched her bemusedly.

“Song,” she said. “If I could have the use of your musket?”

The Tianxi cocked an eyebrow but passed her firearm without asking why. Angharad aimed it, trying to recall what little she knew of using guns, and Song sighed.

“Like this,” the other woman said, leaning close to adjust her stance with gentle nudges.

Angharad raised the gun until it was of a height with her cheek, the butt near the crook of her elbow, and breathed out before placing her shot and pulling the trigger. Flint sparked, powder caught and smoke billowed out.

The bullet took Augusto in the back of the knee, though she had been aiming for the leg.

“Thank you,” Angharad politely said, passing the musket back.

Song looked baffled, opening her mouth then closing it, and the Pereduri left her behind as she strolled after Augusto. The Cerdan was screaming and rolling on the floor, his shot knee a bloody ruin. Though his cloak was in the way he ripped clear his sword when he heard Angharad coming. Wordlessly, she unsheathed her saber.

“You bitch,” Augusto snarled. “You took an oath, you-”

“Followed it to the word exact,” Angharad mildly said. “Is it no fault of mine that you bargained poorly.”

Twenty-four hours had passed on Tristan’s watch: she was, thus, free of her oath. She stood there patiently, waiting for him to drag himself up on his pulped knee. The only reason she had shot him was so that he would not be able to run into the woods and hide. With a hoarse scream Augusto Cerdan got up, leaning on his sword for help.

“We will begin at your leisure,” she informed him. “Prepare as you will – no others will intervene, it is yet a matter of honor.”

Something halfway between hate and disbelief bubbled up onto his face as he realized that this was not simple killing but exactly what she had promised: an honor duel.

“You demented fucking girl,” he breathed out. “You’re still on about Gascon even now?”

Most scholars agreed that if an opponent was capable of talking without difficulty, they should be considered fit to fight. Disinclined to walk too close to the line, Angharad flicked up her sword in a slow movement. A warning, which Augusto heeded. Screaming, he charged at her. The man was fit and from the way he held his blade had been schooled in swordplay, but he was wounded and raw.

It did not matter: even at his best there would have been no doubt about the outcome.

Angharad stepped around his blow, coat trailing behind her, as her footing drifted and she placed her blow to the man’s stumbling back. She slashed through his cape and clothes, carving into muscle and bone, and Augusto dropped with a scream. She moved around his flailing, careful to avoid his touch. Song had said it was all his contract required to be used.

“You can’t,” Augusto snarled. “You promised, Tredegar, promised. You have to let me go, Malani can’t just lie-”

The point of her saber went right through his throat, a clean thrust.

“Pereduri,” Angharad coldly corrected. “As you once told your brother, there is a difference. Had you believed your own words, you might have lived through this.”

She ripped out her blade, and with it the infanzon’s life.

Angharad did not offer a blade salute, for the corpse was underserving of the honor, but she went through her pockets and dropped her last handful of coins on his chest as custom dictated. That was the real choice, wasn’t it? The Fisher pretended that it was either black or white, that she could either follow her father into the grave or damn herself to his tune, but that was not the truth of it.

No empty salute, but copper for the grave.

That was a choice, just like when she used the words exact. To judge who deserved honor in spirit and who deserved it to the letter was not a not some cliff she was tumbling pas the edge of, some disease or addiction. It was just a choice. There was nothing mystical about it. And maybe there would come a day where the hate and fear cracked her faith, where the remembrance of the screams on the wind had her cast away her honor for a ruinous oath, but that was not an excuse. She knew better.

That was the first and last lesson of mirror-dancing: to fight yourself was to lose.

That was why no stripe was added after the tenth, no matter how many times one danced with the mirror afterwards. Theirs was not the boast of Malani swordmasters, each line a fresh victory, but a simpler declaration. To be a swordmaster was to prevail over others, to be a mirror-dance was to prevail over yourself. To surpass your limits, your weaknesses. The tenth time the mirror was danced was merely proof the dancer had chosen their path and would walk it until the end found them.

For the moment the dance began, defeat began walking your way from the other end of the road. There was no telling when it would find you, where and facing who, but what did that matter? The mirror always won, eventually. You could not win against yourself forever, no more than you could win against tide and storm. But it wasn’t the end that mattered, it was the fight.

And Angharad, as she sheathed her saber, decided that she yet had it in her to fight.

# Chapter 45

Four, Tristan counted as the blade went through Augusto Cerdan’s throat.

Though he allowed himself a moment to bask in the satisfaction of yet another Cerdan put in the ground, some precautions were in order. Clearing his throat, he leaned in to politely ask Shalini to shoot Augusto in the head twice more just to be sure. The gunslinger snorted but shot the possibly dead infanzon in the head and heart a heartbeat later. By simple hand, not using her contract, as the unnecessarily flashy spinning of her pistols proved.

Tredegar gave them a mildly disapproving look, but Tristan was unwilling to take a risk with a Red Maw contract. With reason: a heartbeat later, Augusto’s corpse began shriveling up.

It shook and warped and ate itself from the inside, until the cadaver was little more than brown leather with a massive stomach wound going through it. When it finally stopped moving, cracking open like a clay left to dry in the Glare for too long, a hush fell over their group.

“I take back the snort,” Shalini finally said. “Well done, man.”

Tristan tipped his tricorn back. It was not every day he got to arrange the desecration of an infanzon’s corpse and come off better for it. Tredegar cleared her throat, looking embarrassed. Like some slip of a girl at her first dance instead of the whirlwind of death that had casually torn through a man and coldly executed another on a technicality. The thief doubted he would ever get used to that gap.

“Yes, indeed,” Angharad said. “I had thought him dead.”

Fair be fair, she had stabbed him to death. And she was owed some courtesy for scratching another name off his list without bringing any suspicion onto him.

“I expect any of us would have been, in his place,” Tristan said. “But Lord Augusto contracted with a god of the Old Night, and these are made of sterner stuff.”

The gods that had ruled Vesper before Morn’s Arrival might have been toppled from their thrones but even their remnants were fearsome things.

“Eh,” Fortuna sniffed disdainfully, leaning on his shoulder. “We could walk that off too, I’m pretty sure. Ask the girl to shoot you too.”

The Lady of Long Odds went ignored, as was her due. By the flicker of gratitude on Tredegar’s face she seemed to believe he was being polite instead of truthful, which was mildly amusing as for once he had been entirely forthright with her.

“The hollows with Lord Augusto spoke of a hidden passage out of Cantica hidden nearby, one of them even finding it,” the thief continued. “If you give me a moment to look we should be able to leave this town behind at last.”

“That would be lovely,” Lord Zenzele croaked out.

He’d been helped out of the alley by Ferranda, who looked rather worried at the state of him. Not without reason, given his gut wound and missing eye, but Tristan gave him decent odds of surviving now. Had they been out in the wilds the Malani would have been good as a corpse, but now the Watch was here. The bleeding alone shouldn’t kill Zenzele and with a proper physician taking care of him the Malani should be able to avoid infection, the complication most likely to send him for another spin of the Circle.

It took Tristan a little under a minute to find the hidden passage out Cantica. It was nothing more than a shallow gap under the palisade, just large enough to squeeze through if you were willing to eat some dirt, but it would serve well enough. Earlier it had been concealed by a rock and an angle in the dirt – someone had raised a slight slope on the side to make it less obvious to the eye – but the fleeing slave hadn’t bothered to put those back after she messed them up going through.

After calling out his find to the others, Tristan allowed the tension in his shoulders to loosen. With the passage found there would be no talk of riding out the Watch assault in the gaol, and so no need to explain Cozme Aflor’s corpse. The thief honestly believed he would have been able to talk himself out of that grave, but it would be best never to step in it if he could.

Though the tallest among them – Zenzele and Angharad – looked somewhat queasy at the prospect of having to go through that narrow a gap, no one argued against leaving Cantica. It yet remained a risk they might get caught between the Watch sweep and some fleeing cultists, or worse some feet-dragging devils. They set up a rearguard to cover themselves and began crossing, Tristan the first through. Dragging his belly through the dirt, the thief emerged into faded yellow grass.

He made room for Ferranda Villazur, dusting himself off as he got onto his feet. There was no sign of the hollow girl from earlier, but then if she had any wits at all she’d still be running. Song had mentioned something about the Watch encircling the town, but unless the garrison in Three Pines was much larger than the supplies on the Bluebell had implied the encirclement would not be airtight. She had a shot at making it through.

Fishing his tricorn out of the bag he’d put it in for the crossing, the thief patted the worst of the dust off it and put it back on. Much better.

“You do know that hat is a decade out of fashion, yes?” Lady Ferranda amusedly said.

The infanzona looked bruised and tired, but like him the relief at escaping Cantica was lending her a second breath.

“The current fashion involves feathers, Villazur,” Tristan disdainfully replied. “If I were meant to be a bird, I would have been born one.”

The infanzona traced the Circle on her left shoulder, lips twitching.

“That’s heresy,” she informed him. “Palingenesism, to be exact. Only Someshwari cults argue the Circle can spin us into animals.”

“Well, they must have the right of it,” the thief easily said, “for how would you explain the Cerdan if not a past life as some manner of pig?”

She choked, and was still laughing when Song emerged from the gap and asked what they were speaking about.

“The heresy inherent to the porcine condition,” he told the Tianxi.

“I am impressed that you would admit to being pig-headed,” Song replied without batting an eye, “but it is hardly heresy, Tristan. Don’t be so hard on yourself.”

“Harsh,” Ferranda appreciated.

And now the nobility was conspiring with foreigners to take advantage of good, honest Sacromontan folk. Typical. Instead of allowing himself to be further tarred and feathered, the thief – as honest a profession as any in the City – suggested they start a makeshift camp if they were to remain out here until the Watch was finished with Cantica. There was no telling how long it would take, after all.

Song pointed out a pit meant for burning trash that he’d missed a dozen feet to their left and Ferranda volunteered to get a fire started. She recruited him as labor, seeming surprised when he admitted he knew little of how to use a flint and tinder. It wasn’t his fault, the thief thought with irritation, that his lessons about lighting fires had been strictly about arson – an exercise that usually required more elaborate tools than sharp rocks and kindling.

There was still some leftover trash in the pit, mostly animal bones and pottery shards, but luckily there were some logs left as well. It was enough for the infanzona to get a fire going while he served as a glorified windbreak for her efforts, though they might need to venture out for firewood if the flames were kept going for long.

The rest trickled in one after another, the only trouble coming with Zenzele. He needed help on both sides, Tredegar pushing him from one and Shalini dragging him up from the other. The tricky part was doing that without ripping his wounds open further, but they seemed to manage decently enough. Though the seven of them kept their weapons close, as they settled around the somewhat stinking fire they unbent some.

The battle was not finished, the shots and shouts from inside Cantica made that much clear, but their part in it was. Even if there were still devils or cultists around, they were much mor likely to be hiding than looking for a fight. Wary as they still were, the heat of the fire and the relative safety greased the wheels enough for conversation to start. Mostly about what had taken place since they parted ways.

That led to an unpleasant surprise.

“Lan ran for the south when the cultists came out of the woods,” Ferranda said. “One of them winged her with a musket shot, and though Lady Angharad tried to help her back up-”

“I was too late,” Tredegar sadly said. “The bullet caught her in the face. Death was instant.”

Tristan’s jaw clenched and he ignored Maryam’s searching gaze. Lan had not been a friend and barely a companion, there was no need for pity. He was surprised, that was all. The thief had honestly thought Lan would make it to the end, clever and careful as she was. And she almost had, but almost never counted. If she had not run, then… well, there was no telling. Perhaps the cultists would have fired at the others instead, killed Song or Ferranda.

Instead Lan had made herself the standout target and paid for it. All it took was one mistake.

“Now that we know the Watch has encircled the town, I wonder if the cultists were not fleeing blackcloaks,” Song said, looking into the flames. “They were quite intent on following us into the town, desperate almost.”

“I imagine we will be able to ask the rooks if we survive the night,” Shalini sighed, then quirked an eyebrow at them. “And what were you lot up to? You are missing two.”

“The Watch’s shelling of Cantica effectively announced the end of the Trial of Weeds, and thus any possible justification for maintaining the truce,” Zenzele Duma calmly said. “I sought justice for Ayanda against the last remaining architect of her death.”

That got everyone talking, the Malani lord withstanding the storm of worry and cheering and disapproval with remarkable aplomb for a man who must be barely staying conscious. Maryam was praised for doubling back and helping him after Tupoc made his escape – ignoring her insistence that she was avoiding the same cultists they ended up fleeing – and with that skein laid out the conversation turned to Tristan’s part.

“I ran after Cozme, but he’s quick and my leg is wounded,” the thief said. “I had to stop when I encountered two devils headed for the front gate, and after that I headed to the gaol to wait this all out. The other two caught up to me there.”

“I have not seen Cozme Aflor since he ran off,” Zenzele mildly said. “He might well be dead.”

Tristan carefully did not smile at the lordling, who was beginning to grow on him. Malani, he thought, were rather reliable when you had them in your debt. Zenzele Duma would now consider them square for the thief having seen to his wounds earlier, but that was fine by him. Those two sentences had been more than fair payment for the service.

It didn’t matter if they weren’t entirely believed, as between he and Zenzele they had enough people invested in their telling of it being true that there would be no argument. Song’s silver gaze lingered on them both, but she had no horse in this race so why bother? The sole danger came when he glimpsed doubt in Tredegar’s gaze – more directed at Zenzele than himself, interestingly enough. Whatever her suspicions, they never passed her lips.

It looked like Tristan might just have got away with it.

—

They all saw it when the ambush was sprung south of Cantica.

The night broke as a thunderous volley lit up the woods along the dirt road, screams resounding all the way to their fire. Though they tensed, several bringing up weapons, no one came their way. The shots were irregular after that, as if the blackcloaks had been freed to fire at will, but large pillars of pale light rose from the depths of the woods. Glare lanterns, and not small ones. The fighting went on for a few minutes more but not much longer than that.

It must have been a massacre.

Angharad could not much muster much sympathy for cultists and devils, though she felt a pang of worry at the thought that some slaves might have been caught up in the slaughter. Hopefully most would have stayed inside Cantica, where the watchmen would see to their safety as they swept through the town. That part of the battle must be close to done as well, for it had been some time since a shot had last sounded within the palisade. What parts of it were not aflame, anyhow.

Angharad wondered if Tristan even realized his careless gesture had turned half the town into Yong’s funeral pyre.

They had been encamped around the fire for barely more than an hour when finally they saw movement. A party that must have come through the front gate was approaching at a brisk pace. A dozen men, which had them all reaching for arms until Song made out the black cloaks. Even more reassuring, two of the watchmen seemed to be carrying a stretcher. Their company got on their feet as the blackcloaks approached nonetheless, a tall woman with the Someshwari look to her approaching ahead of the rest.

“Sergeant Hina,” she brusquely introduced herself. “We were sent to fetch you and pick up your wounded, but first I need names and a headcount.”

That much was easily provided while Zenzele was helped into the stretcher under Ferranda’s watchful eye. The sergeant, openly tired and her cheek touched with ash, squinted down at a paper in her hand that might be the Bluebell manifest and sighed.

“Were there any other survivors?” Angharad asked.

She suspected not, given how very exactly Zenzele had spoken about Cozme Aflor. The only thing that had stilled her tongue was that she could honestly think of no reason for the other noble to want the man dead.

“Tupoc Xical,” the sergeant replied. “He joined in the scrap with the Saint around the town square and made enough of an impression the cabal sent in by Commander Artal is personally debriefing him. No others were found.”

Tupoc. Of course the smug Izcalli was still alive. What, Angharad indignantly thought, was it going to take to kill that man? Zenzele’s face was cold even as he lay down on the stretcher, but he did not seem truly angry. Perhaps he had expected it, for deep down the Pereduri suspected none of them had truly thought Tupoc would die in the chaos.

Chaos was where he thrived most.

“Now I’ve a few items to cross off my list,” Sergeant Hina said. “Ferranda Villazur, your attention.”

Lady Ferranda tore her gaze away from Zenzele, looking surprised.

“You have it.”

The sergeant cleared her throat, and when she spoke it was in the voice of someone reciting something by rote.

“Given the casualty rates this year and your performance during the trials, Captain Mateo has been instructed to make you two offers,” the older Someshwari said. “One of them is going back to Sacromonte on the next ship out.”

Ferranda’s lips thinned. She had already expressed having no intention of returning to her house and responsibilities.

“And the other?”

“The captain is in town,” Sergeant Hina shrugged. “Speak to him and find out.”

The infanzona hesitated.

“So I will,” she said.

“Good,” the sergeant nodded, gaze going through them until it came to rest on Tristan. “Tristan Abrascal.”

Angharad was mildly surprised to find he had a surname, given he had not used it even when naming himself to the sergeant. How odd. There would have been fewer doubts about his skill as a physician had he demonstrated having a background fitted to such a trade,

“Possibly,” Tristan said. “Who’s asking?”

The Watch officer rolled her eyes.

“An officer was supposed to meet you in Three Pines, but sends word she cannot,” the sergeant said. “She was summoned to the Rookery and will seek you out herself afterwards.”

The Sacromontan was usually a guarded man, Angharad had found, and so it was all the more noticeable when his emotions were laid bare for half a heartbeat. Hope and fear and anger, all in one, so intertwined she could hardly tell them apart. And then it was gone in a heartbeat, all tucked away behind a pleasant smile. Curiosity itched away at Angharad. Who was it that had the grey-eyed man looking so raw – family, a lover?

“Understood,” Tristan said.

“Right,” the sergeant nodded. “We’re all finished here, then, save for those of you with that last bit of business.”

“Business,” Shalini repeated. “Whose?”

“Not for me to decide,” Sergeant Hina said.

Her gaze swept through them.

“You are all free to come into town,” the sergeant said. “Cantica has been secured and in an hour or two we’ll be sending the wounded to Three Pines in a convoy. You’ll be sent off with them.”

She then sought out Song with her eyes, Sarai after.

“That said: Song Ren, Maryam Khaimov.  Captain Mateo sends word that the trials are officially at an end and thus you are no longer bound to secrecy. Who is it you need?”

“Much appreciated, sergeant,” Song calmly replied. “We need only speak with Lady Angharad and Tristan, unless-”

“No,” Sarai – Maryam? – said, sounding mildly amused. “I have not changed my mind.”

Song sighed.

“Lady Angharad and Tristan,” she confirmed.

“I’ll leave you four to it, then,” Sergeant Hina said, offering a nod. “Least I can do, given the sheer nerve of what you did. Been the talk of the barracks for weeks, I don’t mind telling you.”

Angharad flicked a glance at Tristan, finding him unsurprised. Song had told the noblewoman she would have an offeror her at the end of the trials, had Maryam told him the same? Both Shalini and Ferranda looked intrigued that they were not being kept back, but little more than that. Exhaustion blanketed them all. As for Zenzele, one of the watchmen was making him drink from a flask and he was not paying attention to much of anything.

Goodbyes were short, given that they should only be parting ways for a short time, and when the watchmen marched away the others went with them.

It left the four of them alone around the fire, and for lack of anything better to do as the silence thickened Angharad sat back down. She and Tristan on one side, ‘Maryam’ and Song on the other. The pale-skinned of the two women glanced at the other, as if to urge her on, and Song cleared her throat.

“I would have preferred to have this conversation over warm meal and with walls around us, but the gods are fickle things,” she said. “I must begin by clarifying something: not all trial-takers are equal, no matter the year, but this one particularly so. Several among us were, in a word, ‘recommended’.”

She paused as if to let that sink in. Finally they were to learn what all that secrecy had been about, Angharad thought. Well overdue.

“To be specific, the both of you were recommended as candidates to attend Scholomance when it opens in a few months,” Song said.

The Pereduri cocked an eyebrow. She had heard of Scholomance, the ancient school of the Watch that had closed for reasons much speculated on, but failed to see why she would be interested in attending such a place even if it opened anew.

“I thought the purpose of these trials that one would be inducted directly into the ranks of the Watch,” she said. “Why would anyone choose to become a student instead?”

“Ranks is the right word,” Song told her. “That is what survival buys you: a place in the rank and file of the Watch, serving as a soldier of the Garrison or enrolling with one of the free companies. It will be years before you will be considered for an officer’s rank, much less a position of influence.”

She paused.

“Students of Scholomance, upon graduation, are ordained as members a covenant – what you will have heard called the seven Circles of the Watch. In your cases, the same covenant willing to sponsor your candidature in the first place.”

The silver-eyed woman flicked a glance at Tristan.

“Krypteia,” she said, then turned to Angharad. “And Skiritai. That is where you are headed to, should you accept.”

The grey-eyed Sacromontan did not look surprised at the news, unlike her. She very much doubted that her helpless uncle was a member of the Militants, the finest soldiers of the Watch, so he must have pulled strings somehow. Between his apparently having some strings to pull and the false Yaretzi claiming he had spent a fortune assassinating her would-be assassins, Angharad was beginning to realize she knew much less about Osian Tredegar than she had thought.

“How long?” Tristan asked. “The education, that is.”

“Five years,” Sarai – Maryam – replied. “Students will be split into classes according to covenant and taught by veterans from it.”

“There is more to it,” Angharad said. “You said you would have an offer for me, Song, but this is not it. I expect a watchman will make this offer again, formally. What is it you want from me?”

“Tredegar’s got it right,” Tristan said, cocking his head to the side. “What’s the deal, Maryam?”

The two women traded glances.

“This offer was made by a member of the Watch, Angharad,” Song finally said. “I have been one for two years now.”

Angharad stilled, so many pieces coming together. No wonder the Tianxi had been able to get her hands on a map of the Dominion of Lost Things. The Watch would not deny one of their own.

“A little longer for me,” Maryam said, “but it doesn’t matter much. What does is that the two of us are headed for Scholomance when it opens.”

Tristan let out an amused noise.

“By the ends of these trials I will be wearing a black cloak,” he said, sounding like he was quoting someone. “Clever.”

Maryam smiled back.

“I try,” she said, her false humility distinctly smug.

Though the pair was droll to watch, Angharad did not let it distract her.

“You did not need to take these trials to qualify for Scholomance,” she stated. “You got in by other means, the same way most the others students will have. So why come here at all?”

Blackcloak or not, Song had come very close to dying several times during the trials. Given that Sarai – Maryam, she reminded herself – was hardly a fighter, the risks for her must have been even starker.

“For the same reason every cheap mercenary company in Vesper has man waiting next to gaols and gallows, Tredegar,” Tristan said. “They’re looking to recruit from the desperate because no one else will come anywhere near them.”

Angharad met Song’s eyes, and she saw the shadow of a wince in them even though it never reached her face.

“No one attends Scholomance alone,” the Tianxi said. “Students are tasked with forming a cabal on the first day, which will undertake the yearly test assigned to all students of Scholomance. The vast majority of students will come from free companies or large Garrison fortresses, so they will be sent together as a ready cabal. There are fewer free candidates, and of those…”

“I am Triglau,” Maryam bluntly said. “Half of them assumed I was a candidate’s servant, the other half wanted nothing to do with an ignorant savage from the north. I signed up with Song because she’s about as badly off.”

And that was what befuddled Angharad, for Song did not seem like she should be in such straits – not with her skills, her contract or her character.

“What did you do?” she frankly asked.

“I was born,” Song replied. “I am a Ren of Jigong, Angharad. My family is disgraced beyond what words can convey – and cursed for it by five hundred thousand tongues. No Tianxi will come anywhere near me if they have a choice, and my mere presence would be a stone around the neck of anyone dealing with the Republics going forward.”

A pause.

“I am also recommended by the Academy and would be the captain of any cabal I am part of unless there is another Stripe candidate to choose from,” she added. “Between that and my family’s blackened name, there were few takers. None I would willingly take as comrade.”

“So we looked at the other conduits bringing in Scholomance candidates,” Maryam said. “Those that aren’t as pretty. The Dominion was the most brutal proving ground this year, and so the most likely to have hidden gems in it.”

“Now you’re just flattering me,” Tristan grinned at her. “Do go on.”

“We agreed on one candidate each, as four is the smallest accepted number for a cabal,” Song said, meeting Angharad’s eyes. “I picked you.”

And it would have been a lie to say there was not something of a thrill to the words, to such a skilled person deciding she was the finest pick, but Angharad was not sure she could accept. Not when one day she must leave the Watch to take her revenge.

“Song,” she swallowed. “I-”

The silver-eyed woman rose to her feet.

“Come,” Song said. “Walk with me.”

—

Tristan did not bother to watch the pair leave.

He’d not mind making a common cause with Tredegar, even knowing that on occasion he would have to step around her sensibilities, but that was not his trouble to arrange. Instead he sat there with Maryam, warming his hands with the fire.

“How big do cabals get?” he asked.

“Seven at most.”

“You should have tried to grab Zenzele and Shalini then,” he mused.

Ferranda would not be recommended, although he had some suspicions about the offer she was about to be made by this Captain Mateo. Maryam wiggled her hand in a hedging gesture.

“It was a favor done to us to be allowed to take the trials at all,” she said. “If not for putting ourselves in danger we might not have been allowed.”

The thief hummed with understanding.

“So taking too many of the spares would be pushing it,” he said.

The first reason he could think of for the Watch drawing candidates through something like the Dominion would be so they could bulk up the number of ‘free candidates’, meaning that sucking up too many people was likely to be frowned upon by their superiors. Maryam nodded. They sat there in comfortable silence for a moment, the crackling flames keeping them warm.

“Why me?” he asked.

Her brow rose.

“I thought you were joking about the flattery,” Maryam said.

He met her eyes.

“Why me?” he simply asked again.

She snorted.

“I was thinking of trying Ishaan and Shalini, at first,” she said. “Song could tell she has contract troubles, it might have been an angle to rope them in. Only when I was thinking about how to go about it, this rat walked up to me.”

His lips quirked.

“Your disguise needed work,” Tristan said.

“You had me curious,” Maryam said. “Even more after we talked near the docks. And I knew with the map in my head I could join up with the Ramayan crew at any time, so I could afford to hold back and watch until my curiosity was sated.”

“And then you stuck with us when the groups split,” he said.

She softly laughed.

“It’s easy with you, Tristan, even when you make it hard,” the blue-eyed woman said. “You have no idea how rare a thing that is for me.”

He swallowed, faintly embarrassed.

“Me as well,” he admitted. “I have not-”

It was so artless a confession he did not even have the words for it.

“It won’t be easy, even if Tredegar signs up,” Maryam suddenly said, eyes serious. “The tests in Scholomance, they make us compete against other cabals. Most of them will be larger, better trained. And the school itself…”

She grimaced.

“There’s a hundred rumors about why they closed it, back at the Rookery, but the one that everyone seems to believe is that the casualty rates were unsustainable.”

And unsustainable was no small word when spoken by the lips of the Watch, an institution so large that should all its free companies be counted it might be said to have a larger army than some great powers. Mountains of bodies, it meant. Seas.

“That will be tricky to navigate,” Tristan mused. “I wonder what makes it so deadly? They would not purposefully be wasteful, I feel.”

Maryam’s eyes brightened.

“You’ll still come?”

The rat leaned forward, gently touching her hand. The one where two fingers were missing down to the phalange, spent to save his life from his own cleverness.

“I was always going to agree, Maryam,” he gently said. “You paid upfront.”

Softly, almost hesitantly, she clasped his hand back. It had been years since someone simply held his hand like that. Had it been as long for her, he wondered? Looking at the faint wonder on her face, he thought it might have.

And that he did not want to take back his hand scared him more than anything else on this island had.

—

They did not step past the edge of the woods, but they went far enough that the light of the fire seemed on a distant shore.

Song had well weathered the Dominion of Lost Things, Angharad thought. Her collared coat was barely scuffed, her pinned hat singed at the edge but no more. She was hardly even bruised, and the most unkempt part of her was that her long braid was starting to come undone. That was a rare thing: this island, it had swallowed so many of them and even those it spat out had not come out the same.

Angharad thought of the grief in Zenzele’s eyes, of bent-back Shalini bearing Ishaan’s weight and Ferranda leaving all of the Villazur behind. None of them were the same person that had stepped onto the Bluebell, were they? Something inside them had been cut or ripped or burned, and now who they were would walk with that wound until they died.

It was not all tragedy. Tristan and Maryam had been strangers a week ago and now they were joined at the hip, eyes never straying too far from each other. They talked like they’d known each other for years, with that same rare fondness Mother had reserved for comrades she had shed blood with. And Angharad herself, she…

Looking at pale stars above, at the shivering night and the fire that felt like some faraway land, Angharad felt like a stranger still. Peredur was yet home, however forbidden to her. But she had been lost, fleeing across Vesper port by port, and she no longer felt that. She no longer woke smelling smoke, hearing screams on the wind, and though the deaths would never leave her they were no longer the fullness of her shadow.

She had changed. They all had, save for Song Ren.

Song who was the same woman she had been on the deck of the Bluebell that first evening, speaking a cryptic warning that went unheeded. Had she ever really lost her cool, even when they almost parted ways over the matter with Isabel? There had been anger, yes, but controlled. The Tianxi had been mistress of herself still.  Song had walked through lines and ruins and weeds without a mark, without a loss. Silver as untarnished as that of her eyes.

The Tianxi was looking into the woods, at whatever secrets the dark might hide, when she finally broke the silence.

“You were added late to the Bluebell’s manifest.”

“My uncle’s work,” Angharad said. “A man I thought half a stranger but might be that a great deal more.”

“It caught my attention, the shared last names,” Song admitted. “But only so much. It was when the redcloaks cordoned off an entire dock to catch you and nearly got into a shooting match with the Bluebell that I truly became curious.”

“I have an enemy,” Angharad simply said.

There was a cold look on the other woman’s face as she gazed into the dark.

“I do not have that luxury, myself,” Song Ren said. “To cram all the evils inside one man so I might pull a trigger on him and end it in a stroke. I trying to fill a pit, Angharad, that gets deeper with every breath I take. We broke a ninth of the Heavens and my brothers they think they can just-”

She breathed in, sharply, then breathed out.

“It is not an enemy I face,” Song said, voice becalmed. “But I understand what it is, to seek the Watch as a means and not an end. In that we are the same. You hesitate because to join a covenant is not something that is easily taken back.”

“I had thought to enroll for seven years,” Angharad admitted.

“Spend seven years as a footsoldier in a free company or a guard in some Garrison fortress and you will be no closer to your ambitions,” the silver-eyed woman told her. “You will be able to set some coin aside and make a few petty contacts, but nothing more. Seven-year contracts are not held in high esteem.”

“But the Circles are,” Angharad said.

“Call them covenants,” Song said. “Only outsiders call them Circles. The Watch is as a nation of its own, you will learn, with its own tongue and customs.”

“Covenants, then,” Angharad dismissed. “I might know little of the Watch’s workings, but I do know this: to join a covenant is not sworn in sevens. It is until death.”

“Or retirement,” Song said. “That is a right usually awarded only to those who have served for decades, but it can be earned earlier by great deeds. And we will have the opportunity for these. The Watch opened Scholomance again for a reason, Angharad. They are preparing for something.”

The noblewoman frowned.

“For what?”

“I do not know,” Song admitted. “But what I do know is that as a Skiritai, you would become part of a covenant between the finest killers in all of Vesper. One that will be inclined to do you favors even after retirement.”

“I cannot afford to spend five years in a school, Song,” Angharad quietly said. “To let the world pass me by. My house deserves better than that.”

“The tests the Watch will send our cabal on, they are not some schoolyard brawl,” she said. “We will be sent out in the world on genuine contracts. Able to raise our names, to make allies and earn funds.”

And it was tempting, put that way. Yet it was taking a chance. That Song was right and she would be able to earn retirement, that she would win enough to justify the spending of years, that… so many things. Perhaps too many of them. But then Angharad had been taking chances ever since she first began running towards the Bluebell, hadn’t she?

There was no perfect answer. Insisting on one had seen the Guardia kick in her door and seize the last of her possessions in Sacromonte. The temptation was still there to refuse, to look for a path that would give her everything she wanted and cost her nothing, but Angharad had learned not to trust that voice.

Last time it had left with nothing but a saber and the clothes on her back.

The fire looked so far away, she thought, but home was further away still. And she would need to cross more than water and darkness to return, for though putting on a black cloak would stay her enemy’s hand they would remain out there. Waiting, plotting.

How much was she willing to pay, to go back home? How much was she willing to leave behind?

At least this much, Angharad Tredegar learned.

“All right,” she murmured. “I’ll do it.”

And somewhere, the Fisher laughed.

# Epilogue

He’d never liked the Rookery.

It was a purely personal dislike, Captain Osian Tredegar would admit if pressed. He had spent half a year down in the Lanes after enlisting, becoming fit for deployment, and though that had been a foul time it was also long enough ago he hardly remembered. His antipathy nowadays came from the fact that since he’d been inducted into the Umuthi Society he had only ever returned to the Rookery for a fresh squabble over funds with Conclave bureaucrats.

The worst part was, of course, that these squabbles were largely meaningless. The Conclave’s army of clerks and bookkeepers could not actually make any decision, only pass recommendations to the Conclave itself. Which would then proceed to make no decision at all, because it did not directly allocate funding to the works of the Clockwork Cathedral whose continued funding Osian was sent to argue for. The Conclave, in practice, did not actually decide much of anything.

At the founding of the Watch the chamber had been small enough to be functional but over the years the assembly had simply become so large it was not practical for it to decide on anything but the broadest strokes of policy. Execution of those policies was then passed on to committees who ended up wielding the power the Conclave had invested in them with… varying degrees of oversight.

There was some truth to the complaints from the captain-generals that some Garrison regions were essentially rival free companies funded by Conclave coin.

But fair or not it was committees that ran the Watch, and it was such a committee that had ordered Osian Tredegar to sit in a cold damp hall and wait for his name to be called. There had been ten of them out here when he’d arrived, but one by one the other rooks had gone into the small room tucked away in a forgotten corner of the Old Chantry.

And one by one they had left, until there remained only him and the monster.

She looked like a frail old woman but Osian knew better. Fenhua had sent him word last night, warned him that he was looking not as some retired cloak but fucking Nerei Name-Eater. The worst part was that he would never have guessed if he’d not been warned. Even now he almost doubted himself, looking at how she seemed to ache from the wet cold and shiver in her shawl.

There were some who said that creature was older than the Republics, that she’d fought in the last assault on Pandemonium.  Nerei glanced at him, as if sniffing out his thoughts, and offered a warm toothless smile. Ancestors, but she looked like someone’s favorite grandmother.

“I’m sure it will be soon, dear,” the Name-Eater assured him in a faint Sacromonte accent. “There is no need to be so tense, I am certain your niece will be fine.”

Osian stiffened, for he had never spoken a word to Nerei and he’d certainly never said anything about Angie around that monster. His hand habitually drifted to where his pistol would be, had he not been ordered to leave it behind at the Old Chantry’s gates.

“Oh, no need for that,” Nerei chided him. “Such a lovely girl, your Angharad. I’m sure she will be a darling friend to my Tristan. And a mirror-dancer, how precious! They rarely leave Peredur nowadays.”

“I am not without friends,” Osian coldly replied.

His work on the Isibankwa had put him firmly on the good side of his superiors. They had already done him favors, but he should be able to squeeze out a few more.

“Or debts, of late,” Nerei said, tapping her wrinkled chin. “That was most amusing to hear. To think it took the Wednesday Council itself to curb your enthusiasm!”

Osian grit his teeth. The ruling council of the Umuthi Society had not officially spoken with him at all, Professor Akia had sat him down in private so there would be no mark on his record, but the Name-Eater was a Mask and that breed always made a point of rubbing your secrets in your face when they could. Not that he would let himself-

The door opened, the same middle-aged watchman as always leaning through.

“Captain Osian, Officer Nerei,” he called out. “The committee will see you now.”

Osian bit down on his words, trying to smooth the anger off his face.

“Come, dear,” Nerei warmly said. “Let us find out what it is the Obscure Committee has to say.”

Breathing out, Osian Tredegar forced himself to calm down. The monster had just been toying with him the way a cat would with a mouse. She had no true interest in Angharad, he told himself as he followed behind the thing wearing the form of a little old woman. He must keep his mind on the Obscure Committee waiting ahead. Not that it was truly called that, at least on paper.

Its formal name on the rolls was ‘Lesser Committee for the Trebian Northwest’, the kind of name that got made fun of at parties when officers mocked Conclave bureaucracy over cups of wine. It was an oft forgotten detail, however, that the ruins of Scholomance lay in the northwest of the Trebian Sea. Though a ‘lesser’ committee would naturally not have authority over the greater committee overseeing the same region, its existence as an independent entity meant it was not subject to that greater committee’s authority either.

In practice, that meant Scholomance and all matters connected to it had been made the private fiefdom of the four people Osian found waiting inside the small, cramped room. That alone would have been worth wariness but altogether more dangerous was that this authority had apparently been granted to them by a sealed vote of the Conclave, meaning the matter was kept secret.

The Obscure Committee was called that because more than nine tenths of the Watch would have absolutely no idea it existed even though it now held great power and influence.

There were four high desks inside the room, covered with stacks of paper and inkwells, and the four members of the committee sat behind them. The watchman from earlier closed the door, leaning back against it, and Nerei trudged forward to stand before the desks. Osian followed, moving to her right but putting enough space between them he would have been able to draw and fire his pistol in time.

If he still had it.

The gesture did not escape the attention of the leftmost sitter, who raised an eyebrow at him. Brigadier Anju Laghari was a middle-aged woman of plain looks, her wavy brown hair going down to her neck. She was built like a barn door, broad-shouldered and muscled enough to wrestle a bull, and by the looks of the scar around her neck someone had once tried to hang her. Most importantly Anju Laghari was an Academian, a Stripe.

The Academy was the largest of the seven covenants, about as large as all the others put together, so its claiming one of the committee seats had never been in doubt. There was another edge to that blade, however: competition within Academy ranks for the appointment would have been brutal. That meant Brigadier Laghari was as much a political creature as a military one, for all that she looked like she should be leading some charge in the Bleaklands instead of sitting at a table.

And by the disgusted look she sent the monster at Osian’s side, she was no fonder of the creature than he.

“Officer Nerei,” Brigadier Laghari said, her voice sounding like she gargled rocks, “this is revolting. You look like someone’s grandmother.”

Nerei smiled.

“Where lies the trouble, dear?”

The brigadier shivered.

“I saw you eat a man’s entrails with my own eyes, back in seventy-three,” Laghari flatly replied. “Head right in the belly, like a pig with a trough. Put on a shape that I won’t want to shoot.”

The old creature cocked her head to the side, noticeably not moving to obey. Osian had no idea if by right she should, and neither would most in the room: ‘officer’ was the placeholder rank that the Krypteia used when they were not assigned to a duty and thus not forced to reveal their actual rank to the watchmen around them. Anju Laghari might be a sitter on the Obscure Committee, but if Nerei was of higher rank she would not actually need to obey her.

Only one person in the room was likely to know, and all eyes went to him.

At the rightmost desk sat Lord Asher of the Krypteia. He looked like a handsome man in his fifties, his short salt and pepper beard lending him a distinguished air. His clothes were perfectly tailored, their buttons gold, and if not for the polished cane in his hand Osian would have never guessed he had a limp. Lord Asher also wore spectacles, which he never took off because no matter how well a devil took care of the shell they wore the eyes tended to look a little off after a century.

Osian made sure not to look at the rings on his hand or the charming smile on his face. There was no telling if the rumors that Lord Asher was a founding member of the Krypteia were true, but there were records of the man going back centuries and when devils got that old they grew warped. The young ones, fresh out of the forges in Pandemonium, they just wanted tainted aether of any kind. The old ones who annealed grew discerning and addicted to particularities, specific tastes.

First love, fear of water, paternal pride – any of the endless corners of mankind’s soul. No one knew what Lord Asher was addicted to, but most figured it was secrets. He had certainly been in the Krypteia long enough to get his hands on a trove fit to topple an empire. As for the devil’s own rank, well, who knew? The Masks never gave that kind of information forced, and even then sometimes lied.

“Let us be courteous, Nerei,” Lord Asher warmly smiled. “Change for the brigadier.”

The old woman laughed, and after a heartbeat she fluttered. There was no other word for it, as if she had for an instant become made of a hundred thousand slices of paper moving with the wind. When the blur passed the old Sacromontan woman was instead a small Someshwari boy clutching at his too-large clothes, sending a gap-toothed grin up at the Stripe. He could not have been older than five.

Anju Laghari went red with rage, fumbling for a pistol under her desk.

“Change right now,” she hissed.

“D’you want to shoot me now, Brigadier?” Nerei asked.

The cutesy tone, just like a little boy’s, made Osian’s skin crawl. It was like looking at a crocodile wearing a person’s face.

“Asher,” the brigadier snarled, turning to the devil, “this is a threat. She can’t just wear my grandson’s face and-”

“Perhaps,” Lord Asher politely smiled, “next time you will remember to be more careful with your phrasing, Anju. Always a lesson worth learning, no matter one’s age.”

The brigadier was livid and likely to press the matter, Osian judged, but it would not get to that. The sitter next to her cleared her throat. The sound was irritated.

“This is not the Academy, Laghari,” Captain Isoke Falade said. “Your whims are not orders, and we have wasted enough time indulging your sensibilities.”

The committee seat the Guildhouse had got its hands on had been filled by an Akelarre rather than a Skiritai, which was no surprise. The Militants had well-earned their reputation for general awfulness at Watch politics, in part because of the high attrition rate in even in their most senior officer ranks. The Navigators, on the other hand, were arguably the oldest of the seven covenants and they were everywhere.

They always had favors to call on, and they were more than willing to cover for the Skiritai if they got to speak for both of the Guildhouse’s guilds in exchange.

Their representative on the committee was Captain Isoke Falade, a seemingly frail old woman in her seventies wearing humble grey robes.  Her head was nearly shaved and she looked half-blind, pale cataracts in both her eyes, but she was always smiling and cocking her head to the side as if she could hear things no one else did. Given that she was rumored to be one of the most skilled signifiers alive, that was entirely possible.

Despite the seemingly low rank, Isoke Falade had in her time served as Captain-General to the infamous Dawnchasers and survived a decade attached to the court of the High Queen. Long before Rhiannon’s time, so Osian’s sister never knew her, but no one survived at the feet of the Queen Perpetual without learning how to get their hands dirty. A good thing, that. Angharad was headed for the Skiritai Guild, so Captain Falade would be on his side for the coming review.

That and he had bribed her personally, as well as the Skiritai who’d recommended his niece. It always paid to be sure, usually in gold.

Osian’s eyes moved to his other ally in the room, seated besides the signifier. Professor Fenhua He was Peiling Society, not Umuthi like him, but the College always stuck together against outsiders – especially around budget time. Fenhua was a tall and willowy beauty, their long dark hair flowing behind their back as they offered a sunny smile. Their robes were pristine silk in the traditional Jigong fashion, with billowing sleeves and discreet touches of color, every part of them meticulously neat.

Fenhua He’s specialty was epistemological foundationals – attempting to establish objective truths about the aether – and that was as much of an opposite from Osian’s work in the Clockwork Cathedral as one could find but they got on well regardless. Sharing a war room during the hunt for the Hull Breaker had left them with some ties of friendship, at it had most who took part in those months of horror. Fenhua caught his eye and winked, forcing Osian to swallow a grin.

Yeah, Fenhua had his back.

“If Officer Nerei causes such unseemly emotion in our colleague, let us finish our business with her as quickly as possible,” the professor said. “Shall we move to review the candidature of Tristan Abrascal, Scholomance candidate under Krypteia sponsorship?”

Osian cleared his throat.

“Captain Osian,” Lord Asher acknowledged him. “You have a question?”

“Sir,” Osian nodded. “May I ask why I am to be in the room when this Tristan Abrascal is to be reviewed?”

“He and your niece will be joining the same Scholomance cabal, should the reviews end positively,” the devil amiably said. “It was judged unnecessary for the questionings to be kept separate.”

Osian’s lips thinned, but he nodded. Though he misliked the possibility of some Sacromonte rat dragging down Angie with him, he would gain nothing by arguing a decision that would have required a majority vote to pass.

“If that is all, let us proceed,” Captain Falade sleepily said. “We have all read the reports from Lieutenant Wen and Sergeant Mandisa as well as the transcripts from the observers manning the Panopticon Mirrors. The boy effectively led the crew that collapsed the Red Eye’s prison and the mountain with it, though it was not his hand that did the actual deed..”

A heartbeat of silence, then the assessments began.

“He should be shot,” Brigadier Laghari plainly said. “He buried two Watch fortresses, led to the deaths of dozen of our rooks and broke a seal we have no real replacement for. A bullet to the brains is the least of what he deserves.”

Lord Asher smiled.

“There we must disagree,” he said. “As far as I am concerned, Tristan Abrascal is the only individual to have ever passed the Trial of Ruins – if I could, I would amend every preceding file on record as having retroactively failed.”

“Fucking sneaks,” Brigadier Laghari sneered. “You always-”

“You are boring me, Anju,” Professor Fenhua sighed. “All acts undertaken in the trials that do not break the rules qualify for amnesty, as you well know. Stop wasting our time on a tantrum.”

They leaned forward after, eyeing Nerei curiously.

“You have it in your written recommendation that your little maskling was likely involved with forbidden experiments classified under the name ‘Theogony’,” Fenhua said. “Elaborate. I would know if he is a potential danger to fellow students.”

Osian hid his amusement. A transparent fishing attempt, not that they were likely to be called on it. Nerei beamed up at Lord Asher, looking for permission. The monster looked like a child playing in their parents’ clothes, all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. Spirits but it was obscene.

Lord Asher nodded.

“House Cerdan ran a red shop out in the Murk,” Nerei brightly said, “contracting with the local co-caw-coteries for a supply of fresh bodies and running experiments that were in breach of the Iscariot Accords.”

The shape of the five-year old preened, as if the child was proud of having said all those difficult words without tripping.

“To what aim?” Professor Fenhua asked.

It was not Nerei that answered, this time.

“We are yet uncertain,” Lord Asher said, sounding ever so slightly irritated. “Like every other fool out there they tried to make a stable Saint, but they also attempted some exotic contract accommodations.”

He paused, sending the Tianxi a knowing look through his spectacles.

“They used forceful aether taint as a base for their research,” the Mask noted. “Nothing you would be interested in.”

The devil spoke true, all trace of interest leaving Fenhua’s eyes as Osian swallowed bile. Forceful aether taint was a pretty way of saying torture, most of the time. All humans not severed from the Glare tainted the aether around them by their very existence but most of those emanations were so faint they could barely be proved to exist, much less studied. Sharp emotions and sensations were a way to make that taint stronger, and nothing was easier to inflict than pain.

“We had’em, but they closed their lair and ran away,” Nerei pouted. “The Cerdan set up shop on some secret island, but we can’t seem to find their clubhouse!”

“They likely have help from one of the Six,” Lord Asher said. “We are pursuing the matter.”

“Interesting, but ultimately irrelevant,” Captain Falade said. “Our purpose is to ascertain whether or not the boy’s place in Scholomance should be rescinded. Despite Brigader Laghari’s bluster, I see no valid reason for that to be the case.”

“Neither do I,” Professor Fenhua said. “Asher, shall we assume your vote?”

“Never,” the devil seriously said. “I also vote against rescinding.”

Brigadier Laghari grunted in displeasure but argued no further after casting her vote for. She could tell a losing battle when she was fighting one.

“You’ll all be singing a different song in a few years when we are putting down the Red Eye for the eighteenth time and we can’t send anyone to a firing squad to answer for the costs and casualties,” she warned.

Osian let out a noise of interest, catching their attention.

“I heard the Dominion was sitting atop an old god, but I thought it dead from the disaster with the mountain. It survived to fragment?” he asked.

“Our signifiers have ascertained we are dealing with at least a dozen shards capable of agency,” Captain Falade said. “Pandemonium’s last surprise killed the central intellect; at a guess the fragments will be spending the next twenty years cannibalizing each other in an attempt to reform it.”

“The devils laid a skillful trap,” Professor Fenhua noted, then their tone turned teasing. “Why, it might even have been the work of-”

There was a creaking sound, the wood of Lord Asher’s cane giving under his grip.

“-the Office of Opposition.”

Those devils that served as Hell’s answer to the Krypteia, Osian recalled, though it seemed from Asher’s smiling anger that there might be old history there he knew not.

“It was not,” the old devil said, tone clipped.

“If you say so,” Professor Fenhua said, smiling like someone who had just scored a point.

“No matter whose work it was, it failed to kill the god,” Brigadier Laghari dismissed. “Now every shard is going to become patron to a different tribe and that entire island is going to become a clusterfuck of bloodletting for a decade. A clusterfuck we will need to wade into, I’ll remind you, because reports made it clear that the Red Eye made it down to the seabed. We can’t let that thing reform and grow any further.”

“Aw,” Nerei grinned, “is nani angry because her friend Commander Artal is going to have to stay and do his job instead of getting a nice cushy promotion?”

She made a soulful look with the small boy’s doe eyes.

“That’s neshpotism, gramma,” Nerei solemnly said, wagging her finger. “Very bad.”

Brigadier Laghari’s face reddened and the flash of rage in her eyes was entirely unfeigned.

The Academy’s prominence and occasional bouts of arrogance made it unspoken tradition for the other covenants to join hands and knock them down a peg whenever the occasion arose, but not even that was enough for Osian to find himself rooting for the Name-Eater. He was not alone in this.

“Disrupting the proceedings is reason enough to be barred from the room,” Captain Falade said. “I will not warn you again, Officer Nerei.”

The monster nodded, pouting as she clutched her too-large clothes to her scrawny chest. Professor Fenhua cleared their throat.

“Let us proceed onward, then.”

“Which brings us to your niece, Captain Osian,” Lord Asher said. “She makes an interesting case.”

Osian straightened his back. Interesting was never a word pleasant to hear coming from a Mask’s mouth.

“I have not read the full reports,” he carefully said, “but what I got my hands on seems a glowing recommendation.”

“If you try to rob my colleagues out of an eighteen-year-old mirror-dancer, Asher, there is going be a veritable shitshow to deal with,” Captain Falade warned him. “After that report from the cabal in Cantica there was already a fit about the Stripes getting the Xical boy, we won’t get cheated twice on a single draw.”

Brigadier Laghari looked faintly smug.

“I do not doubt her value,” Lord Asher dismissed, “but I do find it concerning that her contract appears to be with a second-order entity. Peredur is full of things best left buried.”

Osian’s jaw clenched. He knew not the nature of Angie’s contract, but the whole thing reeked of Gwydion. Rhiannon had been much too taken with the triumph of winning the darling of the season to ever dig into her husband’s past, but Osian had always found him suspect. A young man from a fallen house that was barely peers suddenly becoming the flower of Pereduri society when he made his debut? No, Gwydion had been wildly suspicious even before Rhiannon’s enemies began having a rash of mysterious accidents all involving spirits.

If the man’s meddling hurt his daughter from beyond the grave, Osian was going to get his hands on the body just to feed it to stray dogs. Thankfully, he had anticipated that the Krypteia would dig and stacked the game well in advance.

“There has been no conclusive proof it’s a genuine god of the Old Night she contracted with,” Professor Fenhua mildly said. “More likely it is some ancient oracular river-god that was missed during the High Queen’s purges.”

It took effort for Osian not to do the intellectual equivalent of pretending he could not see something right in front of him when the purges were mentioned, the trained reflex still there after all those years. It was not acknowledged that such purges had ever happened, in Malan. Or that it might be in anyway unusual that the High Queen had ruled for over five centuries.

Lord Asher shrugged.

“Absence of proof is not proof of absence,” he said. “All worries could be put to rest by allowing the Krypteia to-”

“No,” Osian burst out.

All eyes went on him. He licked his lips, ignoring Nerei beaming up his way with that childish grin.

“I mean,” he said more calmly, “that as Angharad Tredegar’s personal sponsor, I do not consent to interrogation by the Krypteia.”

As if he would let the Masks anywhere near her. Knives were the least of what their interrogators had in store.

“That settles the matter, as far as I am concerned,” Captain Falade mildly said. “Professor Fenhua?”

“It is my professional opinion that Angharad Tredegar’s reported contact with the Red Eye is highly unlikely to have resulted in contamination even if she is truly contracted with a second-order entity,” the willowy beauty replied. “I have no objections to her candidature.”

With a senior signifier and Peiling professor coming down on his niece’s side, there was no one left in the room with the professional standing to argue further. Lord Asher’s brow furrowed, but the devil said nothing more.

“I have concerns as well,” Brigadier Laghari announced, drumming her fingers against the desk. “Not about the girl’s contract, but of the potential trouble that Captain Tredegar brought to our door on her behalf.”

The Pereduri did not grimace. He had been forewarned this would likely be brought up during the review.

“I am willing to answer any question, Brigadier,” he evenly replied.

The older Someshwari hummed.

“You’re a senior officer but not all that highly ranked in the Umuthi Society,” she said. “Yet you have disbursed a sum that is around-”

She glanced down at a paper, then let out low whistle.

“Well, around the budget for our entire Dominion operation for a year,” Laghari said. “Where is the coin coming from, Tredegar?”

“That seems an unnecessary intrusion,” Professor Fenhua said. “Surely there is-”

“Sustained,” Lord Asher cut in.

Captain Falade said nothing, leaving Osian to sigh.

“As some of you may know,” he said, “the Clockwork Cathedral allows its members to register inventions with them, giving all rights over the Watch in exchange for a flat portion of revenues in perpetuity.”

One in a hundredth, which could mean either a pittance or a king’s ransom depending on what was registered.

“What did you invent?” Laghari asked, sounding interested.

To say Osian had ‘invented’ the rifle would be untrue, for there were already some in the Republics and allegedly in the northern Someshwar, but he had invented the Isibankwa-pattern rifle. Which was accurate nearly a third further than the Tianxi attempts and could be made at half the price. Most importantly, the casting process required only a few tool changes from the current Watch musket workshops. That would save the order millions over the next decades, something he would not gain coin from but had earned him many an indulgence from the Wenedsday Council. Unfortunately, his rifles were not yet being made on any large scale.

The first workshop had only just been refitted last month.

“A weapon, but it is only registered and not yet in service,” Osian admitted. “I borrowed from the Watch on future revenues.”

“Huh,” Captain Falade said, sounding amused. “How far ahead?”

No one came to his defense this time, not even Fenhua. They looked as curious as the rest.

“By the Cathedral’s estimates, I have borrowed the next eighty-three years of revenue,” Osian said, coughing into his fist embarrassedly.

All four of them were veterans, so the only indication of surprise was Fenhua’s lips slightly twitching.

“Well,” Brigadier Laghari grunted, “if you were splashing that much gold around, it explains the mess in Ixta. I won’t weep over the cutters cutting each other, but I was given to understand you nearly caused a major diplomatic incident in Sacromonte.”

Osian’s jaw set mulishly.

“I only paid for retaliation on whoever was targeting my niece,” he said. “I did not give instructions to-”

“A mansion belonging to a house of the Six was torched, Tredegar,” Laghari flatly interrupted. “The coin was tracked back to one of our payhouses in the city and House Salavera lodged a formal complaint with the Conclave.”

If the infanzones wanted to play the hirelings, Osian disdainfully thought, they should not complain of being treated as such. Besides, their hands were hardly clean: after the incident, in a fit of spite the Salavera had ordered all their contacts in the Guardia to join in the hunt on Angharad. It was half the reason Osian had done more than pretend to obey when Professor Akia had told him to pull the contract and steer his niece towards Scholomance instead.

“I was not aware that we now answered to Sacromonte yiwu trash,” Professor Fenhua sneered.

“Maybe not in your libraries, but some of us live in the real Vesper,” Brigadier Laghari flatly replied. “We import more than half the food for our Trebian holdings through Sacromonte, Fenhua. We don’t poke at the Six without a good reason.”

“Our order has a long history of taking in lost souls with nowhere else to go,” Lord Asher smiled, never quite showing his teeth. “I do not believe you want this to change, Anju, so what is it that you are proposing?”

“That we don’t rub their face in the girl joining the black any more than we need to,” Brigadier Laghari said. “Let the offence die down some by sending her cabal somewhere quiet and out of sight for its first test. We can take the temperature before their second year, see if the storm has passed.”

“There is some sense in that,” Captain Falade conceded, pawing at a stack of papers and ripping out a sheet with a noise of satisfaction. “And here: the Asphodel Rectorate requested for us to find their latest cult, it seems a fitting assignment.”

Osian’s brows raised in alarm at the suggestion. Rooting out a hollow cult was supposed to be a quiet assignment? Professor Fenhua noticed his expression and let out a snort.

“Bored nobles playing cultist, not a true cult,” Fenhua assured him. “Last time we caught them they were dealing with some fertility god for party favors. There’s not much trouble to be found in Asphodel. Captain Osian.”

“An acceptable compromise,” Lord Asher mused. “Under this constraint, I vote to maintain Angharad Tredegar’s candidature for Scholomance.”

The other three agreed, one after the other and like that it was done. It would be all right, Osian told himself. He had been to the Rectorate once or twice, if barely beyond the port, and it was a faded power. A backwater past its prime, more concerned by its petty squabbles with other third-raters than its own diminished standing. As quiet as it got in Trebian Sea.

How much trouble could one really get in somewhere like the Asphodel Rectorate?

# Chapter 1

Tristan woke to the gentle rocking of the ship.

It was dark inside the cabin, his bedding pulled tight around his body in deference to the coolness of sea winds. The thief’s eyes stayed closed even as he pricked his ear, every groan of the old galleon keeping him on edge: it sounded like someone walking on an old floor.  Though the Fair Vistas was large enough he had been given his own cabin and it had a lock on the door, Tristan had spent a great deal of his life picking locks.

They were not any real indication of safety.

Not that he had solid reason to fear for his, as an inducted watchman on a Watch ship headed for a Watch school. There was just something about the almost-silence and the dark of the cabin that… And that sound was not just creaking wood. Movement, Tristan thought as his eyes flew open and he threw himself out of the bed. A knife hit the headboard with a sharp thud, half an inch from his face, and as he threw his bedding at the attacker the thief reached for the knife under his pillow.

It wasn’t there. Shit. Tristan ripped out the knife in the headboard just in time to get kicked in the stomach. He staggered back, striking blindly, and heard a snort as his wrist was caught. He moved with it but it was twisted behind his back. He kneed his attacker in the side but they ignored the blow and kicked his footing down from under him. Dropping to the floor, he rolled and covered his ribs from another kick before cutting at the side of their leg.

It drew blood, going through a thin layer of cloth, but his triumph ended when a heel was placed on his throat. When they didn’t immediately push in his pharynx and kill him, he realized something was wrong – not that he had time to spare for thought, pushing away that foot and headbutting between the opponent’s legs. A woman, he learned from both what he hit and the faint grunt of pain before he got kneed in the face and rocked back. Scrambling away, he rose to his feet and…

And his leg gave. His limbs were trembling, like he’d been-

“Contact poison on the knife’s grip,” Abuela said. “That was your first mistake.”

Well, that explained why Fortuna hadn’t woken him up. She avoided Abuela like the plague.

“Ow,” Tristan eloquently replied, flopping to the ground.

His limbs were in open rebellion, the louts, and his face was most definitely going to bruise.

“Which?” he got out.

“Shellfish toxin, my own recipe,” she said. “You will be fine in an hour. Save for the bout of diarrhea, which we shall call the price of getting sloppy.”

Tristan let out a whimper. The runs, really? There was no privacy on a ship, everyone would hear. The humiliating punishment would have been confirmation of who he was facing even if he couldn’t more or less make her out in the dark. Even absent a lantern he glimpsed the silhouette of her as she sat on the edge of his bed. Abuela was rather short, five feet and change, but her impressive mane of snow-white hair made her seem taller – the mid-length wavy bob looked almost regal.

Sharp, red cheekbones with cheeks pulling tight and a jutting chin finished the distilled look of a Sacromonte family matriarch, which her stern maroon eyes helped sell. Abuela looked frail, all wrinkled skin and bones, until she kicked you in the stomach and it felt like you’d been hit by a cart.

“Now,” she said. “What was your second mistake?”

The thief forced himself to think even as his limbs twitched uselessly, lying on his side and looking up at his teacher. The dosage must have been very precise for the toxin to weaken his limbs but leave his tongue just fine.

“I should have cried out for help,” he realized after a heartbeat.

“Yes,” Abuela agreed. “You are of the Watch now. You need to learn to use that, to shake off the habits of the Murk.”

He’d not even thought about it. Back home calling for help was a gamble at best and when you were a thief the odds that the reinforcements would be on your side made it the kind of gamble only the Lady of Long Odds cared for. Tristan slowly nodded. The others, Maryam and Tredegar and even Song would have come to his aid had they heard. He knew that, intellectually. But it was not yet an instinct.

“You always said not to grow roots,” he said.

He shied away from outright asking. He had not done well enough in her test to earn the right to ask whatever he wanted – he’d be taking whatever she cared to throw his way, nothing more.

“The others will be taught by their covenants that a cabal is a sacred thing,” Abuela told him. “Comradery beyond law and reason. It is not.”

She leaned forward.

“You do not have the luxury of that lie,” the old woman said. “You are to be a Mask, Tristan Abrascal. A creature of angles and lies, necessity’s bastard son. The Krypteia is despised by the other covenants because we are, in truth, as much a check on them as we are on the Watch’s enemies.”

He could not quite see it, but he felt Abuela smile.

“Care for them, if you like,” she said. “But do not ever forget that should they betray the Watch, it is you that will be called on to put poison in their morning tea.”

And part of him rebelled at that, not even at the killing but the unfairness of it – that everyone else might get a home while he would only ever have a room – but another part accepted it without batting an eye. Of course it would be that way. All his life Abuela had taught him to use the crowd without being part of it, this was just but an extension to an old lesson. She was not the kind of woman whose teachings made exceptions, not even the Watch got a pass.

There was a sharp comfort to that, a knifelike relief. Some things did not change.

“Your performance tonight was only middling,” Abuela continued, “but I did promise you answers before sending you down the path to the Dominion. You may ask.”

Tristan swallowed, a hundred curiosities crowding his throat until it felt fit to burst. He must pick carefully, he told himself, for she would not be patient forever. Something important, a useful secret. And yet what ripped itself past his lips was anything but.

“You trained me for this,” he said. “All this time, you meant me for the Watch.”

“Yes,” Abuela simply replied.

“Why?”

“Why put a knife to the whetstone, a till to the land?” she asked. “Because that is their purpose and nature. When I found you, Tristan, our hunt was already carved into your bones. Now you will chase them with skill as well as hatred, that is all I changed.”

His jaw clenched. It had the ring of truth to it.

“Scholomance,” he pressed. “There are other ways to join the Watch, or even that school. Why send me to the Dominion of Lost Things?”

“You could have been enrolled on my word alone,” Abuela casually admitted, “but you would have lost your chance at Cozme Aflor. A name on your little List, yes?”

“Yes,” Tristan hissed.

It had been weeks yet he still savored the memory of his knife cutting that throat like the finest of meals. The Cerdan brothers had only been interest on an old debt. Cozme Aflor, he’d been the fifth of a balance in need of settling.

“And what did you learn from him?” Abuela asked.

“It is still Lord Lorent that runs their house of horrors,” Tristan said. “It’s out in the Trebian Sea somewhere but the staff may have changed. Professor Ceret is being used as a children’s tutor, of all things.”

He grit his teeth.

“And I know the god, now,” he said. “Cozme called it the Almsgiver.”

A thoughtful pause.

“Not a name known to me,” Abuela said. “A sobriquet, I imagine, as it would have been foolish to use its real name. Still, that is useful information. You did well.”

And it fell into place, just like that.

“You used me to get at them,” Tristan said. “In a way that can’t be traced even if the Cerdan have people in the Watch. It wasn’t just about me, it was about what I could get for the Krypteia.”

“And you got us a name, dear,” the old woman smiled. “You did not disappoint.”

“And Lieutenant Vasanti, was she another bird to catch with your one stone?” he coldly asked. “She hated me from the moment she knew you’ve taught me, Nerei.”

His eyes narrowed.

“If that is even your name.”

Abuela considered him for a long moment.

“It is not the one I was born to,” she told him. “Yet it is the one I have kept the longest and which I prefer, as it was earned and not given.”

“She called you an abomination,” Tristan challenged.

She laughed, sounding almost pleased.

“I am the last of the fifty servants of the Changing King, eater of his name,” Abuela replied. “For this men came to call me Nerei Name-Eater, crowning me heresiarch. One day you will learn the meaning of that word, Tristan, and understand that fear is the least of what it deserves.”

And though he knew not why the whisper of the syllables in the air – heresiarch, king in heresy – sent a shiver down his spine. It was as if the word itself were a dreadful thing, poisonous to the touch.

“Vasanti Kolanu sought to unearth things best left buried and was thrice chided for it – twice by myself, once by one of your fellow students,” Abuela idly continued. “She took poorly to the lesson.”

“You didn’t answer my question,” Tristan quietly said. “Did you set me up to kill her for you?”

Abuela smiled.

“What do you think?”

“I think you’d say you left it up to chance,” the thief said. “But you know how I am and you know how she was, so chance was never part of it. I cleaned up your loose end for you.”

“You did not take her life yourself,” Abuela said.

“Neither did you,” he said. “But that’s now how you taught me to do it because it’s not how Masks work, is it? I did you a favor. That means you owe me.”

“Bold,” she said, but did not deny him. “And what would you use a favor on?”

He grimaced.

“There’s a man in Sacromonte,” he said. “He was married to one of the trial-takers-”

“Pietro Ragon,” she said. “The General-Killer’s wayward husband. Run off with Hoja Roja money, I believe.”

He was not even surprised she knew. Gods, Abuela even knew more than he did – he’d not known the surname of Yong’s husband or even that he had one.

“Yes,” Tristan said. “Yong was in a red game, under terms that if he got to the third trial they would write off the loan and spare him. He did get there, but…”

“You want me to make sure,” Abuela said.

“And to tell him about what Yong did,” he said. “I will myself, one day, but I understand I might not be able to return to Sacromonte for some time.”

“It is a wasted favor,” she told him. “The coteries scrupulously observe all the terms of the red games.”

Tristan frowned.

“It’s the Hoja Roja,” he skeptically said. “They’d cheat their own mothers for drinking money.”

“True,” Abuela said. “And yet I did not lie.”

Ah, a riddle-lesson. A puzzle whose pieces he must find and put together by asking the right questions.

“The red games themselves are nonsense,” the thief said. “Yet plenty of the largest coteries do them. What is it they get out of it?”

“It is gambling,” Abuela said.

“A senseless kind,” Tristan pointed out. “It is expensive to buy seats and they do not even see the deaths. Paying a fortune for reports seems like a poor game. Why not have their indebted fight to death in a pit, if that is their itch?”

“Why indeed,” Abuela said.

He cocked his head the side. He’d been looking at it the wrong way by wondering why the Roja would suddenly grow a conscience. They had not. It was simply that the choice was not theirs to make.

“They’re not gambling with each other,” he said. “There’s a god involved.”

Abuela smiled.

“The coteries bet on the manners of death,” the old woman said, “and if they predicted correctly they earn boons from their patron.”

He blinked.

“That is ritual sacrifice, or close enough,” he slowly said. “Forbidden by the Iscariot Accords.”

“The deaths happen on Watch grounds, under Watch auspices,” Abuela said. “It is a narrow line, but they walk it – as they have for over a century now.”

And the Watch let it happen, Tristan thought, so there would be more deaths to feed the gods they used to keep the Red Maw contained. Red games, red fates and red hands all around. Gods but it was an ugly business. But Maryam had broken the machine and that should put an end to it. There was no more seal to strengthen, no need left for an altar. That was something.

“So Pietro Ragon is safe because if they welch on the terms of the bet the god will get angry with the coteries,” the thief mused. “That only means the debt is written off, though. The man might still be in trouble.”

“Minor troubles,” Abuela said. “Worth using a favor on?”

Tristan sighed.

“Yes,” he regretfully. “Please tidy it up for me.”

To his surprise, the old woman looked approving.

“Tying off all your loose ends properly is the mark of professional,” she said. “A sensible decision, worth the reward of a warning.”

He swallowed.

“I’m listening,” Tristan said.

“You are a wanted man,” Abuela said. “A price has been placed on your head – taken alive.”

He did not hide his surprise.

“The Cerdan?” he asked.

They should not know of him, at least not enough to put coin on his death. His killing of Remund Cerdan was still a secret to all but Maryam and a dead woman.

“No,” Abuela said. “It is from inside the Watch, someone with connections. Scholomance will not be safe.”

“Students are allowed to fight each other?”

He’d thought the trials of the Dominion an outlier, not the rule.

“Yes. Not to kill, but much anything short of that,” the old woman said. “Abducting and selling you would not be against the rules, strictly speaking.”

He would have rubbed the bridge of his nose if he could. They’d not even docked at the bloody island and already other students had it out for him.

“I don’t suppose there is anything you could do?” he tried.

“Do not worry of any hands but that of other students,” Abuela said. “That is what I have done.”

He slowly nodded his thanks. She was running interference with whoever was behind this, then, but could no more dip her finger into Scholomance affairs than his mysterious enemy could. It was not a pleasing compromise, but he would live with it. Would have to. Abuela leaned forward, patting his shoulder.

“One last word of advice,” she said. “Do not wait for plaques to be forged. Take whatever they have on hand.”

Though he had no notion of what a plaque would be, Tristan filed the advice away. If she had bothered to give it out it was worth heeding. Still, the mysteriousness was worth a dig.

“Cryptic,” he said, rather proud at the double-meaning.

Even in the dark, he could feel the unimpressed look he was being fixed with.

“That hasn’t been funny in at least a century,” Abuela sighed.

Tristan would have made a rude gesture back, but his limbs were still flopping about. He really must ask her for that recipe next time they met, he could think of all sorts of uses for it. The old woman rose to her feet, brushing off a piece of lint from the loose shirt she was wearing. Those are the same shirts and trousers most the sailors are wearing, he noted.

It only occurred to him then that the Fair Vistas was days away from any land and had not slowed enough for another ship to dock.

“Have you been on the ship the whole time?” Tristan asked.

“Have I?” Abuela mused. “I wonder. You might learn if you saw me leave.”

The thief glanced at his useless limbs and sighed.

“Can you tell me where my knife is, at least?”

“Yes,” the old woman agreed.

He was unsurprised when she walked away without another word, unlatching his lock and quietly closing the door behind her. Tristan rolled onto his back, wiggling his ass to find if he might be able to sit but instead landing with his cheek pressed to the floor.

“For a proper prostration you’re supposed to be on your knees with your hands past your head,” Fortuna said. “Still, I’ll give you points for trying.”

“Thank you for the help, as always,” he sarcastically said. “Would it have killed you to give me a heads up before running for it?”

“I didn’t run for it,” the Lady of Long Odds lied. “I was just busy with other things.”

“Funny how you’re always busy when she comes to visit,” Tristan said.

“Coincidence,” Fortuna dismissed.

He rolled again, looking up and finding Fortuna seated atop the trunk holding his affairs. She had changed the style of her dress again – though still blood-red, it now bore a high collar and a pale mantle before descending into puffy sleeves. The skirts were more closely cut, still hiding away her feet but no longer trailing behind. She had gone heavier than usual on jewelry, too: the loose belt around her waist was a golden rope set with red jasper and over her mantle she wore a gold choker alternating rubies and pearls.

“Your mood has turned,” he noted. “Are you that afraid of her god?”

He did not for certain Abuela had a contract, but had always assumed. It was either that or she was half-ghost, able to appear and disappear at will. Fortuna glared at him.

“I fear nothing,” his goddess insisted. “She is discordant, Tristan. It is… imagine the worst sound you know, made into a song.”

“Discordant,” the thief repeated. “As opposed to ‘harmonious’?”

The word she used to mean becoming a Saint. Fortuna looked away without answering, which was as good as a confirmation. What was the opposite of sainthood, then? Maybe having a soul so hostile to divinity it hurt gods to be in its presence. Tristan itched to know what a heresiarch was, but it seemed like the kind of question that was dangerous to ask. He would have to be careful, gauge the dangers and put a scholar in his debt.

“I am starting to look forward to Scholomance,” Tristan mused. “It seems a place full of opportunities.”

And enemies, but of where was that not true? The thief’s stomach gurgled ominously. Ah, the side-effects of the shellfish toxin Abuela had warned him about. Tristan tried to move his hands and got some of his fingers to twitch.

Now he would get to find out which came first: working limbs or the runs.

—

Breakfast on the Fair Vistas was odd.

The galleon was the largest ship Tristan had ever been on, but Captain Krac – don’t try to joke, the first mate had warned them, she’s heard them all and she’s got a temper – had arranged matters so they got to eat between sailors’ shifts. The four of them were usually alone in the common room, a strange feeling in a ship that felt crowded even when running on a skeleton crew.

The morning cook was an old Sacromontan bastard missing an eye and most of his teeth, which he’d had replaced with obviously fake silver. He and Tristan had taken to each other instantly, smelling the rat on the other, and as a consequence the old man simply cocked an eyebrow instead of asking about his black eye or… nightly affliction. Tristan trudged out with his plate and mug, nodding his thanks, only to immediately be ambushed by his own crew.

“Did you somehow lose a fight with your bedframe?” Maryam asked, lips twitching.

He glared halfheartedly at the Triglau. Having shed any pretense of disguise, like Song the pale-skinned woman was now entirely in Watch blacks. A collared tunic with silvered buttons that went down past her knees, black breeches tucked into tall leather boots. With a dark headband to keep back her bangs, she looked very much like the blackcloak she’d been since they first met.

She also sounded amused, because Tristan was cursed to be surrounded by women who took delight in his pain. He sometimes suspected he might have crossed some great god of femininity in a previous spin of the Circle.

“I was visited last night,” the thief grunted back, setting down his plate.

He claimed the empty spot by Song, facing Maryam and Tredegar – who only offered him a nod, tearing into her meal with polite gusto. To his continuing bemusement, the noblewoman seemed to enjoy ship fare. More than him anyway: he was used to the fish and cheese, but he could have done without the ale. Unfortunately Captain Krac had rationed drinking water until the next rain, so he was left to drink that fermented swill regardless of preference.

“By the runs, I hear,” Song drawled. “Apparently the crew though you were getting attacked.”

Song wore much the same as Maryam, though unlike the Triglau she wore the accompanying black cloak even when inside. By the looks of it she’d freshly remade that long braid going down her back.

“Was it the dipped biscuits?” Tredegar asked, sounding sympathetic. “I saw some the crew offering you some, but that is risky business. My mother always said you should never eat shipboard food you haven’t seen the cook nibble at.”

In truth that seemed rather sound advice, like most of the advice Angharad Tredegar attributed to her mother. Some kind of famous Malani explorer, he’d been told, but ‘Sizani Maraire’ rang no bell. A month ago he would have thought Tredegar’s concern a false one, perhaps a verbal knife being twisted, but Tristan had learned better. The noblewoman was painfully earnest, which somehow made this worse.

It was a little early for a man to be besieged on all sides in such a manner but Tristan had long known that life was full of injustices.

“I did get attacked,” Tristan said, gathering together the last shreds of his pride. “Abuela came in the night, beat and poisoned me then left behind some crumbs of information.”

Angharad Tredegar straightened on the bench, eyes hardening.

“We are guests on this ship, under the protection of the Watch,” she said. “To attack you is-”

“I appreciate the concern,” Tristan cut in, surprised to realize he mostly meant it, “but it has always been this way with her. She is a hard teacher but not unfair.”

“Ah, a lesson,” the dark-skinned woman nodded. “I understand.”

The thief squinted at her. Usually people disbelieved him when he mentioned Abuela’s methods – one Orthodoxy priest had thought she was a pimp beating him, something Fortuna hadn’t let go for months – so he had to admit some mild concern over Tredegar’s absence of concern. Mind you, her parents had tried to feed the Pereduri to a monster once a year since she was eight so her standards might be skewed at tad.

Maryam leaned across the table, frowning at him, and slowly came to rest a finger on the bridge of his nose. He went cross-eyed trying to look at what she was doing until she withdrew her finger.

“You’re not emanating any different in the aether,” she said. “You shouldn’t be cursed. That I can tell, at least – it isn’t my specialty. And while I’d like to make fun of you for getting beaten up by yet another crone, I’m rather stuck on the detail that this Abuela of yours apparently showed up on our ship in the middle of the sea.”

Tristan shrugged.

“It’s Abuela,” he said.

“That’s not an explanation,” Maryam informed him.

“Give it a few years,” Tristan honestly replied, “and it will be.”

It had been something of a shock as a boy to realize that the sweet old lady that’d obviouslygotten lost in the Murk and needed to be warned off the Menor Mano boys – out to rob her and sell her off to a Trench crew – had never been in any danger at all. She had, if anything, been the danger.

Song cleared her throat.

“You mentioned information?” she asked.

This isn’t over, Maryam mouthed to him from across the table. Chwop billy tang, the thief mouthed back, nonsense just legible enough she’d think she had failed to read his lips right. Song was cocking an eyebrow at him by the time he looked to her again.

“Apparently there is a price on my head,” he said. “Some people might be after me at Scholomance.”

A pause.

“As a prisoner,” he clarified. “Not a corpse.”

“Already?” Maryam mused, chewing her cheese. “That’s probably some sort of record, Tristan. Our cabal is already breaking fresh grounds.”

“Take this seriously, Maryam,” Song said, tone gone flat.

Tredegar looked unmoved at the thought of further enemies but Song was openly irritated. Tristan and the Tianxi did not get along particularly well – that the noble on their crew would be easier to deal with than the republican had been a most unwelcome surprise – though he’d concede her dislike did not color how she treated him. She was a professional, which he could respect.

“Difficulties mount,” Song sighed. “Tristan, kindly investigate the matter after we dock so that we might decide how it would best be resolved.”

“That was already my intention,” Tristan shrugged.

Best to go to his would-be abductors before they went to him, as choosing the grounds was a lot likelier not to end in him with shackled in some ship’s belly.

“I’ve also been advised to take whatever plaques are on hand instead of waiting for new ones to be forged,” he said. “Though I’m not sure what it means.”

Maryam’s face gave no hint as to her thoughts and Tredegar was politely attentive, which had yet to stop being… unsettling. It was Song who had answers.

“When our cabal is registered on the school rolls, we will be granted funding and identification plaques to access it,” she said. “I only know so much of Scholomance, so I cannot tell you more.”

Tristan hummed.

“How do you know so much of Scholomance, anyway?” he asked. “Maryam does not seem to.”

He flicked a glance at the pale-skinned woman, who shrugged.

“I don’t,” she said. “The Navigator that recommended me hasn’t been this far south in years and before I was offered a candidature I lived on one of the guild’s island outposts. Not the sort of place where juicy gossip gets traded.”

Maryam was not, of course, a member of the Akelarre Guild. Like Song she was a member of the rank-and-file of the Garrison, though Maryam had been recruited by a Navigator and only ever stayed in outposts under the authority of the Akelarre Guild. They had clearly been grooming her for the covenant before offering her the shortcut of joining by graduating from Scholomance.

“Much like all of you, I have a connection in the Watch,” Song admitted. “My great-aunt’s widower, a member of the Academy. He is the one who recommended me.”

“And he’s got something to do with Scholomance?” Tristan pressed.

“He is of sufficient rank to know some things, but only so much. The school is some kind of private fiefdom within the Watch,” the Tianxi said.

“My uncle mentioned meeting me in Scholomance as soon as he can,” Tredegar said. “I could ask him about this.”

Ah, yes, the famous Uncle Osian. He of the apparently unlimited funds and jolly bribery. Tristan thought it more than passing odd the Pereduri officer would be willing to sink a fortune in helping a niece he’d apparently only met twice, but that might be the orphan in him talking.

“If we’re to register it will probably be the same day we dock,” Tristan said. “Unless he’s already there and waiting for you we’ll have to make the decision blind.”

Tredegar acknowledged the reply with a nod.

“It would be foolish to dismiss a warning from a high-ranking member of the Masks,” Song noted. “Let us heed it if we can.”

“We could ask Ferranda and the others if they know anything,” Maryam suggested. “They should be getting there about a week before we do.”

Mostly bad luck on their part, that. While Lady Ferranda Villazur had accepted the offer of being recommended for Scholomance by the Academy, she’d been told that the best way to have the formalities finished in time was passing through the Rookery. As a consequence, while Ferranda and the two she intended to make a cabal with – Shalini Goel and Lord Zenzele Duma – had departed on the Bluebell days ahead of the Fair Vistas’ expected arrival, the four of them should have arrived at Scholomance long before the others did.

Only the Fair Vistas had been a week and a half late, a third of her crew missing when she docked at Three Pines. They’d run into a Gloam storm, of all the bad luck. If they’d not had a skilled Navigator with them the storm would have likely taken every soul on board. There was a reason Tristan and the others had all gotten individual cabins instead of being made to share.

“I approve of reaching out in principle,” Song said, “but it might be difficult to find them in practice. The number of students attending should be slightly above four hundred.”

Tristan let out a low whistle.

“That is a lot of dangerous people,” he said.

Maybe some of those who’d got in through connections would be softer, but anyone making cut for Scholomance was bound to have an edge to them.

“The school itself might be as dangerous as the competition,” the Tianxi said. “We must be very careful when we arrive. Already our… situations come with enemies, we cannot afford to make fresh ones.”

Tredegar cleared her throat, which earned her a fondly raised eyebrow from Song.

“Yes?”

“Then we should remember that Tupoc will have had weeks there to dragoon some followers,” she said. “He will no longer be alone.”

Tupoc Xical had left a day before the Bluebell, that was true. The Aztlan had gotten in good with a cabal during the battle for Cantica and one of the members had insisted that Tupoc get to sail with them.

“They’re supposed to go through the Rookery as well,” Tristan pointed out. “He might get there at the same time as Ferranda’s lot, but not much earlier. Certainly not weeks.”

Tredegar shook her head. To his surprise, so did Maryam.

“Did you not have a look at their ship’s hull?” the Pereduri asked.

Tristan shook his head. He had stayed away from the docks in Three Pines, wary of attracting the attention of the cabal before it departed. If one of them was a Mask, they might get curious about the odd details surrounding Cozme’s death.

“It was metal,” Song provided. “I have seen others like it before, though rarely and only flying Watch flags.”

“They are tomic ships,” Tredegar said. “That is to say, the hull is made of a tomic alloy. You might know such ships better by the name of ‘skimmers’.”

The thief blinked. He had heard that name before.

“As in the magic ships that never lose their way and can fly?” he skeptically said.

“They cannot actually fly,” the noblewoman said, sounding faintly disappointed. “But the metal is an Antediluvian alloy with strange properties that cut through Gloam and aether. They ‘skim’ on the surface, thus the name.”

“That’s only mostly true,” Maryam noted.

She got a hard look from Tredegar at the phrasing for that, innocently smiling back. Those two were taking to each other worse than he and Song, and he was not even sure he could entirely blame the noblewoman for it. When she angered Maryam, it was usually by accident.

Maryam was most definitely doing it on purpose.

“You can have a tomic ship that’s not a skimmer,” the blue-eyed woman continued. “Most aren’t. There are some that don’t even make the entire hull with alloy, just the keel. It’s why you can get rich raiding First Empire ruins and finding no artefacts: even a door frame made of tomic alloy will be worth a fortune if you strip it out and sell it.”

Interesting he had never heard of that around the docks, but then that kind of trade would have been a little rich for his blood.

“The ship in port was one of those?” Tristan asked.

Maryam nodded.

“It just had the metal hull,” she said. “Mind you, it’s still quicker than anything made out of wood.”

“Except Malani ironwood,” Tredegar mildly added.

She sounded rather satisfied she could correct Maryam in turn. The Triglau rolled her eyes.

“Except the magic wood Malani sell to no one, yes,” Maryam agreed. “For a ship to be a skimmer, however, it needs not only a tomic hull but an aetheric engine. That is much rarer, and even though they surpass everything else in service no one makes skimmers anymore.”

“Are the engines truly that difficult to make?” Song asked, sounding surprised.

How Tianxi of her, Tristan thought amusedly. Like it was no trouble to make even shoddy copies of Antediluvian wonders. Half the Six were on top of the infanzon pecking order mostly because they’d got their hand on some First Empire treasure and could work it well enough.

“I can only guess, but I would say it’s about coin,” Maryam said. “The aetheric engines we can make are nowhere as good as those inherited from the First or even Second Empire, so the largest ships we can make are still smaller than caravels.”

Tristan was no sailor, but he had worked around the Quay long enough to learn a thing or two about trade ships. Caravels were known to be sleek, quick and needed only a small crew but they were a rare sight in the Trebian Sea because a caravel also could not carry much cargo. Hulks, carracks and galleons were a lot more profitable to run unless your goods were small and needed to be moved quickly. Caravels were mostly Malani and Ramayan ships, meant for exploration across dark and distant seas.

“So the skimmers we can make are expensive, too small for war and too expensive risk on exploration,” Tristan summed up.

“They also need a dedicated shipyard on special grounds and the materials for the engine are almost as rare and expensive as tomic alloys,” Maryam said. “The great powers probably can afford to build some skimmers, but for what? The old ones keep well, so most nations have legacy ships still in service that make anything they could build look like children’s toys.”

“The Republics might buy them,” Song noted. “Most of the fleet from the times of the Kingdom of Cathay has been sunk or stolen.”

“No one will sell the Republics ships,” Tredegar said, not unkindly. “Tianxi are already very quarrelsome at sea, no other power would want to strengthen their position.”

Tristan choked.

That was more than slightly amusing coming from a Pereduri, of all things. The Kingdom of Malan was infamous not only for producing more pirates than all the other great powers put together but also for its tendency to anchor war fleets just out of bombardment distance of whatever small nation they wanted to establish trade with. It was an old sailor’s joke that any land discovered by the High Queen’s ships would soon have to take either her gold or her lead.

“Tianxia has been involved in many quarrels at sea, I am sure,” Song calmly replied, a delicate rebuke. “Regardless we have strayed from our original conversation. I take it your point is that on such a ship Tupoc will arrive long ahead of us, or Ferranda’s crew for that matter?”

Tredegar nodded.

“He will make a cabal, or take one,” the Pereduri said. “We should be prepared to face him.”

“He’s a Stripe, so the only one of us who should share classes with him is Song,” Tristan said.

The Tianxi shook her head.

“Only about half the lessons will be handled by our covenants,” she said. “There will be general classes as well, where we might run into him.”

Which meant they would, because Tupoc would not be able to resist poking at his old friends from the Dominion.

“I’m told we’re not allowed to kill other Scholomance students,” Tristan said. “But also that not much short of that is disallowed.”

Tredegar perked up, gaze turning to Song.

“If I cut all his limbs off, do you think they would grow back?”

The thief quietly swallowed, mouth gone dry. The tone was hopeful, like a little boy who thought he might get lamb for supper. Like she was not casually speaking of chopping off a man’s arms and legs. Gods, every time he thought he was getting used to her.

“Perhaps we might try diplomacy first,” Song mildly replied. “Either way, unlike Ferranda’s crew he is best avoided if we can. I expect he will find his fellow students have much less patience for his antics than circumstance forced us to keep back on the Dominion.”

Tristan hummed.

“We are going around in circles,” he said. “There’s no point in making a plan if we do not know the lay of the land we’re headed into.”

“That is… not untrue,” Song reluctantly conceded.

“It will not be too late to decide once we get to Scholomance,” Tredegar said.

She rose from the bench, picking up the plate she had emptied before anyone else at the table.

“I was promised a spar by one of the officers I do not want to be late for,” she informed them. “If you will forgive me, I must take my leave.”

“I might as well accompany you,” Song said. “I finished the book Captain Krac lent me, I should return it before asking for another.”

He and Maryam waved them off, their own meals still unfinished. After they had left to return their plates to the cook, leaving the two of them alone, he cocked an eyebrow at his friend.

“You know much of skimmers,” he leadingly said.

“A Navigator is needed to run them properly,” Maryam replied, a little too casually. “Preferably a Tinker from the aether branch as well, but always an Akelarre guildsman.”

He said nothing, only biting into his salted fish.

“And I might have a personal interest in them,” she admitted.

The grey-eyed thief cocked his head to the side.

“May I ask why?”

Maryam considered him a long moment, then sighed.

“There’s somewhere I need to go,” she said. “And it is, I think, the only kind of ship that could get me there.”

“This place of yours – dangerous?” he idly asked.

“Very.”

“Secret?”

“There are no maps in existence.”

“And, I assume, forbidden?”

“By both gods and men,” she agreed.

“Sounds,” Tristan Abrascal mused, “like an interesting place to visit, one of these days.”

Blue eyes on grey. A moment passed, then her shoulders loosened.

“Maybe I could be talked into bringing you along,” Maryam Khaimov smiled.

# Chapter 2

Song had found Captain Alejandra Krac’s cabin a haven of elegance and learning.

Lined with heavy rows of books and two hung maps – one of the Trebian Sea, the other of Radamant’s Reefs – it boasted simple but pristine furniture and a few personal trinkets. Song had always appreciated that so many in the Watch disdained luxury, like Tianxi officials.

“I must confess Coyol’s works have ever been a chore to me,” Captain Krac noted as she slid the borrowed volume back into the right spot. “His histories of the unification of Izcalli are the most reliable, certainly, but those eschatological tirades grow tiresome.”

The captain was a tall and thick-set woman, with round cheeks and serious gray eyes. She was missing half the fingers on her left hand, bearing intricate wooden prosthetics in their stead, and was nimble enough in their use it was hardly noticeable. Maryam was not nearly so skilled yet.

“I find them worth suffering for the lack of Toxtle partisanship,” Song replied.

The House of Toxtle were the first Aztlan kings to unify most of what was now the Kingdom Izcalli into a single realm, putting an end to the bloody era their scholars called the ‘Rule of Jaguars’. To shore up their delicate position the Toxtle had undertaken a remarkably sophisticated effort to create a cult around themselves, including arranging for historians to present their rise to power as inevitable and ordained by the gods. It was nigh impossible to find a contemporary work not dripping with praises for the mighty, peerlessly righteous House of Toxtle.

Coyol, the third son of a conquered king, had been rather skeptical of this alleged fatefulness and too well connected for the Toxtle to suppress his works.

“Besides,” Song continued, “has there ever been an Izcalli work that did not holler about the coming end of days?”

Captain Krac did not smile, for she was not that kind of woman, but her stern face was faintly touched by rue.

“I suppose if they keep at it long enough they’re bound to be correct eventually,” the captain said. “I would offer you another pick from my shelves, but I fear you would not be able to finish it.”

Song immediately straightened to attention.

“We are soon to arrive, then?”

“It is my navigator’s estimation we will reach Tolomontera by midmorning tomorrow,” Captain Krac confirmed. “We have made good time.”

A hint of pride in the older woman’s voice, not underserved. Even if they had been lucky with the winds the Fair Vistas has recently lost a third of its crew to the Gloam. To exceed expectations in such a situation spoke to a tightly run ship.

“I would suggest you prepare your company for arrival,” the captain said, and it was not a suggestion.

It was a dismissal, and Song took the hint from the very busy woman who had extended her the courtesy of this conversation. She nodded, thanked Captain Krac and retired to the guest quarters. Abrascal had been plotting in a corner with that ever-grinning cook last she saw, which hopefully would keep him and the goddess following him like a playful cat busy for a while still. If she recalled correctly, which she did, Angharad should currently be charming the ship’s fighting contingent.

Effortlessly and in complete ignorance of what she was doing by being so friendly and polite while wiping the floor with everyone in spars. 

She even had a way even with the old sea dogs, those that sneered at anyone spending more than a month a year on land. As for the young men, well, Song suspected the Pereduri would be leaving a broken heart or two behind when they departed tomorrow. Mind you the Tianxi found it difficult to muster sympathy for any boy fool enough to genuinely believe Angharad’s eyes kept flicking to the muscled arms of that Aztlan watchwoman because she was ‘curious about the tattoos’.

Song put a spring to her step, lips still twitching at the utterly transparent excuse the noblewoman had gotten out when teased about her lingering eye.

With the other two members of her cabal occupied, she was now freed to have an overdue conversation with the third. It was to Maryam’s door that her steps took her, for she knew it the signifier’s habit to retire to her cabin for time alone an hour before dinner. Song was early for that, but with Abrascal in the wind she suspected the pale-skinned woman would have retired ahead of the usual.

Song could not blame her. Watchmen were better learned that most in matters of Gloam and Glare, but Maryam was still stared at by much of the crew even after over a week at sea. Open distrust from strangers wearied the soul, no matter how unearned. Two sharp knocks against the door earned only silence, at least until there was the sound of movement behind the door and Maryam called out asking who it was.

“Song,” she replied. “I require a moment from you.”

The Tianxi waited a little longer before the other woman cracked open the door, dark hair disheveled and looking somewhat grumpy. Song cocked an eyebrow but said nothing. Though Maryam insisted she meditated before dinner, it often looked like she’d just woken from a nap when she was interrupted. The pale-skinned woman flicked a glance back and forth across the hallway – more out of habit than distrust, Song suspected – and only then opened the door all the way.

“Come in,” Maryamsaid. “Mind the candles.”

The Triglau moved out of the way and Song entered as bid. All their cabins were the same, the Tianxi had seen when they were assigned, save for Abrascal’s which was in a corner and so slightly more cramped. All held a bed, a trunk, a small table with a stool and a worn dresser. Only Maryam had propped up the table and stool in a corner, laid her blanket on the ground and placed candles in a loose circle around it. Perhaps she trulyhad been meditating, Song mused.

“Will this take long?” Maryam asked. “I can’t afford to burn my way through my allotment.”

“It should not,” Song replied.

Her gaze swept around for a place to sit until she heeded Maryam’s invitation to sit on the edge of the bed.  The other woman stayed standing, leaning back against her dresser. She was, Song only now noticed, barefoot. Silver eyes flicked over the candles, noticing the faint pale hue to their light – Glare-touched, all of them. Interesting. She knew little of signifying, as the Akelarre Guild was tight-fisted with its secrets, but she did know it was an art of the Gloam and not the Glare. Why use such candles, then?

“We will be arriving early tomorrow,” she said.

Maryam grunted in approval.

“Good, I could do with sleeping in a proper Meadow,” she said. “I couldn’t let down my guard an inch on the Dominion, it’s been exhausting.”

The Akelarre Guild was allowed to hold private land on most Watch grounds, Song had learned, in part so that they could build these ‘Meadows’. Their purpose was obscure, save that Navigators rested in them regularly and seemed to count themselves better off for it.

“I imagine the Navigators will have a chapterhouse at the port,” she replied. “Though it is what follows after our arrival I come to speak to you about.”

A pause.

“There has been bickering.”

Maryam cocked an eyebrow.

“There has,” she said. “You should bury the hatchet with Tristan. He’s really quite sweet, you know.”

Song carefully kept her thoughts off her face. Sweet? The man was grenade with a lit fuse. Not once since the scales were ripped from her eyes had Song ever known a god to manifest as often and as clearly as that golden-haired goddess did around Tristan Abrascal. He must be either a madman or halfway to being a Saint, though eerily enough he showed none of the usual signs of incipient sainthood.

Song’s subtle inquiries with some of the Sacromontans during the trials had yielded no recognition for a goddess in the guise of a golden-haired woman in a red dress, which was even more worrying. The easiest way for a god to thrive without being known and willfully worshipped was to have been born of an event so catastrophically momentous it burned in the minds of thousands still.

Which meant Tristan Abrascal likely was a madman riding a calamity god, and though Song would not shy from using him she also had every intention of holding him at arm’s length until he inevitably got himself and quite a few other people killed.

“That is not what I meant,” Song said.

Maryam thinly smiled.

“I know exactly what you meant, Song,” she replied. “That was a warning to keep walking. Best you heed it.”

The Tianxi’s jaw tightened. Maryam was usually an agreeable woman.

“I understand your issues with Angharad’s background, but-”

“No,” Maryam harshly said. “You don’t. You think you do, and I won’t deny the gods dealt your family a hard hand, but you have no fucking understanding of this at all and I will get very angry with you if you ever again pretend otherwise.”

Song’s lips thinned, but she held her tongue. You are stone shaped by the chisel of life, she recited. Will it be your hand wielding the tool, or theirs? If she gave her anger to others, she relinquished the chisel – and that was unacceptable. Maryam’s words were no way to talk to a superior officer, but strictly speaking Song was not that until their cabal was registered.

Moreover, her earlier dealings with the other woman had been along the lines of a partnership without rank involved. It would take time for the adjustment and Uncle Zhuge had warned her that as a rule hierarchy tended to be played loose within cabals.

“We have fights enough waiting for us,” Song finally said. “Can you, at least, cease provoking her?”

Maryam’s face closed down like a house come winter, and she knew immediately she had made a mistake.

“So you’ve decided to change ships now that you no longer need me,” Maryam stiffly said. “Fine. Best I knew it now, I suppose..”

Song stiffened at the accusation.

“I have done no such thing,” she said.

“Have you had this talk with Tredegar?” the Triglau smiled.

There was no joy in it.

“I intended to-”

“That’s a no,” Maryam cut through. “Allow me to be clear, Song: she gets no apology from me for the discomfort of being reminded her people treat mine like chattel. And Stripe candidate or not, you are in no position to make me.”

Song met her eyes, for anger was a personal matter but not so a challenge to authority. If that stone cracked there would be no mending it – and Song would not be captain of their cabal in name only. She kept her voice clear, calm, free of anger. Hand on the chisel.

“A direct order from a captain,” she said, “is not refused without consequence.”

“There’s no ink on paper yet, Song,” Maryam replied. “And even when there is, we both know that there can be transfers to other cabals – without or without your captain’s permission. If I don’t stick around, do you think Tristan will?”

Even one departure might be the death knell of a cabal as small as theirs, Song thought, but two would be for certain. A cabal must count four students or be dissolved, and while perhaps one departure could be replaced in time two would cause questions to be asked. If Song stuck with Angharad they would no doubt find another cabal willing to take the both of them in, but that could not be. She needed it to be her name on the reports – Captain Song Ren – or there was no point to any of this.

It was not a threat without teeth but going belly up now would be the end of her captaincy before it even began. No one obeyed an officer they’d bent. Song measured her words, matched anger to need and found the right stride. She could not slip, not even a moment.

“You would peddle a murderous street rat with a rampant god and a Triglau signifier who can only use Autarchic Signs,” Song evenly. “Do you think it would take me more than half an hour’s work to make it so that not a cabal on Tolomontera would be willing to touch either of you even with plague gloves on?”

“I can do more than that,” Maryam hissed.

“Not well,” Song bluntly replied. “Now, let me be clear, I do not want to do this. There is no gain to be had. But if you set out to do me harm, Maryam, I will answer by throwing a torch at every single bridge you’ve so much as glanced at.”

She sneered back, but the Tianxi knew it a front. Maryam had reasons to want to attend Scholomance just as urgent as Song’s own. Now she had laid out the consequences, made it clear that an attack would be met with worse. She must now make it clear there were no chains, that she was not cornering Maryam either. A house with a lock that only one man may open is called a prison, Master Shijian had written.

“If you truly want to part ways, I will not keep you. I only require that we proceed in a civilized manner,” Song continued. “We will arrange a trade with a cabal suiting you and settle the matter without harm to either party.”

Now to address the accusation. She leaned forward, face intent.

“I came to speak to you on matters of bickering first because I have known you to be level-headed and because your provocations are purposeful,” Song continued. “Angharad Tredegar gives offense by accident, Maryam. It does not excuse her, and she is not excused, but it does mean it shall take more than a single polite conversation to begin curtailing the issue.”

She met Maryam’s blue eyes.

“Do we now understand each other, Maryam Khaimov?”

The two matched gazes for a long moment before the Triglau looked away.

“I grew angry too quickly,” Maryam finally said.

“And I approached the matter poorly,” Song acknowledged.

She had underestimated the delicacy of the matter, thinking of the other woman’s level-headedness as an absolute instead of a choice. She had broken zunyan, if only by accident. Maryam passed a hand through her long dark locks, letting out a sigh. The other woman looked tired, Song decided. There had always been rings around her eyes, but they seemed darker now.

“I’ll try to refrain from pulling at her tail too much,” Maryam said. “But if she so much as-”

“I would not expect you to answer an insult with silence,” she cut in. “Nor will I ask.”

Maryam let out a noise that might have passed for agreement and the silver-eyed woman decided it would have to do. She rose from the bed, then hesitated a moment. No, it could wait. She nodded at Maryam, but the Triglau frowned at her.

“Your hand,” she said, extending hers.

“I was not going to ask,” Song stiffly said.

She was not so thick-skinned as to request a favor after an argument.

“I’m still angry with you,” Maryam bluntly said, “but not enough to risk your health. Your hand, Song.”

The Tianxi cleared her throat, somewhat embarrassed, and gave it. Maryam’s fingers clasped her own and the signifier closed her eyes. A moment passed then Song felt a faint ripple go up her arm – like a shiver, hair-raising and swiftly gone. Maryam let out a long breath, opening her eyes and releasing Song’s hand.

“The concentration is nearing dangerous again,” Maryam said. “Did you purge at all while on the Dominion?”

Song’s lips thinned.

“Twice,” she said. “Once during the Trial of Lines and again after we reached Three Pines.”

“You might be at a high tide, then,” Maryam said.

The Tianxi smothered a grimaced. That or the curses were gathering quicker.

“Purge tonight,” Maryam advised. “The salt in sea water should make you harder to reach but there’s still a risk.”

Song nodded and gave her thanks. A look at the candles told her that their conversation had lasted longer than anticipated and perhaps to Maryam’s material detriment. Song barely used her own candles, given her eyes, so it should be a fitting apology to gift the other woman most of her allotment after dinner. The Tianxi took her leave, briskly heading for her own rooms. There should be time enough for a purge before dinner, though she would look tired afterwards. Still, better to do it early than late. She tended to get nightmares if she did it too close to falling asleep.

Locking the door behind her, Song took from her bag a green pouch and a wooden bowl. First she untied the strings on the silken pouch, carefully spilling some of the salt to trace a circle on the floor. She would have to buy more soon, she was nearly out. She would make a note in her ledger. Then came the bowl, a simple wooden piece whose insides were blackened as if sprayed with acid. Song filled the bowl with her water jug, then stepped inside the salt circle and sat down cross-legged.

The bowl she set down at her side, and after taking a long breath dipped the fingers of her left hand in the water. She closed her eyes and focused on her breathing. In and out, letting her senses trail off until there was nothing but her breath and the dark.

And, after an eternity, there was the smell.

Like offal, like rot and hate and shame made into a stick of incense. Song forced herself to ignore it, to focus on the steadiness of her breathing. It was only when her fingers were touching the dried bottom of the bowl that she opened her eyes again. There was not a drop of water left in the bowl, and fresh black scarring from the curses she had purged from her body.

When she had been a girl the purge was only needed once every few years, but nowadays it was twice a month. It was getting worse with every season, for an endless sea of hatred and misery was being poured into the Gloam by every Tianxi who’d lost to the Dimming.

By all those lips the name Ren was snarled as a curse, until it had become exactly that.

Song slumped, suddenly exhausted, and allowed herself a moment of bitterness at the unfairness of it all. She had not even been born. But only a moment, and then she put herself back together piece by piece. Like putting on formal dress, layer by layer until she was armored against the world. Song was not her brothers: she would not let the weight of duty break her back as it had theirs.

Song Ren would wield the chisel and she would win.

—

Come early morning on the morrow they were all sent to their rooms by First Mate Javier, who instructed them to stay inside until told otherwise. Song and Maryam, better learned on the subject of Scholomance than the other two, guessed why without difficulty.

“We are soon to reach the Ring of Storms, then?” Maryam asked.

The tall, exceedingly mustachioed – all Lierganen seemed convinced that nailing an entire ferret above their upper lip was somehow distinguished – officer nodded.

“We have the clouds in sight,” the first mate said. “Any moment now we’ll be hitting the storm front.”

“Ring of Storms,” Abrascal repeated, eyebrows raised. “Now there’s an ominous name. Might I ask what it is?”

“A ring of storms,” First Mate Javier drawled back. “There is one encircling Tolomontera, which must be crossed to reach our destination. There’s no need to worry – it is barely a mile wide, we have sailed through worse – but obviously we can’t have you underfoot during a storm.”

“Of course,” Tristan Abrascal smiled, nodding low.

Song’s eyes shortly dipped to the golden-haired woman standing by his side, whispering in his ear something that made the man’s jaw tighten ever so slightly. The Tianxi wrenched her gaze away immediately, though, for twice now the goddess had almost caught her looking and she would rather keep the details of her contract hidden. As usual, Abrascal was a headache.

Song breathed out, tightened her grip around the chisel. That was not impartial. The deity’s presence was, however, taxing in how it forced her to pretend blindness. It was one reason she avoided Abrascal, and why he sometimes irked her more than he strictly deserved to. If at least she could hear the goddess Song might have a notion of what manner of entity she was dealing with, but for now she could only try to sketch out the deity’s machinations through her mortal hand’s deeds.

“May I request being told when we’ve passed the Ring?” Song asked. “I would not want to miss the sights.”

“It’ll be your first time, won’t it?” the first mate mused. “Fair enough, the works are certainly worth a look. I’ll see about sending you a man.”

She duly thanked the officer before he took his leave and they retired to their cabins as ordered.

Song had been disposed to wait patiently but found herself restless. She could have gotten ahead in her correspondence, but writing in a storm would only lead to spilled ink and unintelligible characters. She had already folded her clothes twice and checking on her pack one more time held little appeal. If she’d had a book she could have made use of the time, but as things stood it felt like she was throwing away hours.

Pacing back and forth did not help.

Eventually she sat on the bed she would have remade regardless and made to practice Feng’s List. As one of the first scholar-diplomats the Republics sent to Malan, An Feng had written several of the definitive texts on learning Umoya. Feng’s List was a highly respected speaking exercise, a series of words that helped the speaker learn Umoya’s three tones and six accents.

“Muthi,” Song carefully enunciated, burying herself into the exercise.

It kept her mind from drifting until the ship began rocking from the storm. Her voice weakened as her hands tightened against the sheets. What this what it would feel like, to be a head of cabbage in a cart tumbling downhill? Utterly powerless, at the mercy of a pile of wooden planks held together by nails that, right now, felt all too small. She forced herself to continue Feng’s List, and when she finished it to start again. And then again, until the storm passed.

She was not certain how long it took, save that however short a span it might have been it had still taken all too long. Yet fairer weather prevailed, and as the rocking calmed there was a quiet knock at her door. The first mate had sent a sailor, as promised, and Song felt so relieved to be allowed out that she had to force herself to wait and remake the bed instead. Hand on the chisel.

She climbed to the bridge once she was better composed, finding it wet and smelling of salt but filled with cheerful crew. The crossing must have gone well. The forecastle was nearly deserted, so Song took the stairs up and found a spot out of the way to lean against the railing. The Tianxi stayed there in silence, savoring the gentle stir of the wind against her hair. The earlier nerves bled out drop by drop, leaving her sagging against the wood until she remembered she was still out in the open.

She recognized Angharad by the sound of her steps, which were oddly cadenced. Not sharp like a soldier’s or with a sailor’s lurching swagger but something closer to a fencer’s gait, light and ever ready to spring into movement. Angharad made a noise upon catching sight of her, then came to join her at the railing. The tall Pereduri’s elbows came down, coat sweeping back as she put her weight on the wood. Nodding a greeting – which Song returned – the other woman smiled and cast a curious look ahead. The Tianxi cocked a questioning eyebrow.

“You had me curious,” Angharad said.

A look at the horizon, then she snorted.

“Still do, in fact. It will be hours yet before we reach Tolomontera, what is it that you would look for on the horizon?”

“We’ve left behind the last clouds of the Ring of Storms,” Song said. “Soon we should catch our first glimpse of the Grand Orrery.”

Angharad rocked along with the rocking of the galleon without even noticing, the Tianxi noted. She envied her that comfort: though not prone to seasickness, Song would never be at ease standing on a rickety hunk of wood surrounded by angry water as far as the eye could see. She found it difficult to understand how seafarers could be so fond of a life where no amount of skill or valor would make a whit of difference if the day’s luck decided you were to capsize and drown.

“I have never heard of this Grand Orrery,” Angharad said. “An Antediluvian wonder?”

Song nodded.

“Some say it is the very reason for the existence of the Ring of Storms, that it tames wind and weather the rest of the way to Tolomontera by pushing out all the wildness onto the Ring,” she said. “I do not know if this is true, but it was described to me as a wonder like no other.”

The Pereduri cocked an eyebrow.

“Is an orrery not some sort of mechanical map mimicking the movement of the stars?” she said. “Something not so dissimilar was built on the ceiling above the Trial of Ruins, you might recall. I struggle to believe another such device would be all that exceptional.”

Song smiled.

“You will not struggle long,” she said, and a glance at the horizon saw her smile widen. “There, we see the first of it.”

The Tianxi pointed at a distant silver light near the line of the horizon, Angharad marking the sight with a skeptical look.

“It seems to me you point a star, Song,” she said.

“I do not,” she replied. “Look closer.”

The noblewoman did, frowning but trying to understand what she might have missed. It was Angharad Tredegar’s willingness to learn that had settled the matter of who she should recruit. The mirror-dancer would not entertain the thought that nobility was fundamentally unjust – she did not know the principle of zunyan, that partiality in dignity was a violation of the Circle – but that inflexibility did not extend to her actions. Angharad admitted her faults and tried to mend them, a rare thing regardless of birth or what land one hailed from.

The troubles with Isabel Ruesta had almost made Song reconsider her choice, for she would not yoke herself to someone whose every principle bent for a pretty face, but there had admittedly been… extenuating circumstances. Besides, the past was now buried.

Unlike Isabel, who’d had to do with being tossed onto a campfire.

“It moves too quickly,” Angharad suddenly said. “Stars are too far for us to easily grasp their movements, but this one’s can be caught by the naked eye.”

“It is not a star,” Song agreed. “It is a light large as a manse being moved by machinery. I expect within a quarter-hour we’ll be seeing the first ring.”

They stayed together on the deck, small lengths of conversation split by lengths of comfortable silence, as more and more lights joined that first silver pinprick – which grew larger and larger as the ship approached. The sailor in the crow’s nest shouted something that sounded like ‘first ring’in mangled Antigua, her warning before they got their first real glimpse of the Grand Orrery.

Churning white waters came first, and then they saw that from the depths of the Trebian Sea rose a massive circle of gold angled to the side.

There were two of them, in truth, with a slight space between. Each was broad as a man was long and slowly turning. It was a sight surreal, seeming more a monster than a machine for all that Song the truth was otherwise.

“Sleeping God,” Angharad murmured, sound awed. “How large is that ring?”

“The diameter should be at least four hundred miles long,” Song said. “There are several more, all of them orbiting a device at the heart of Tolomontera.”

As the ship sailed closer false stars bloomed one after another, gargantuan golden rings moving the great orbs of colored light – blue, silver, green and gold and a dozen colors more – according to some eldritch purpose. Like jewels set in a crown the lights were shepherded by rings of differing sizes and angles and make. Some were delicate, eerily delicate like steel wire the size of tower, others like thick bands of gold. It was half an hour more of staring in wonder as the crew busied themselves around them before the pair saw their first light up close.

The colors were trapped inside magnificently intricate globes of gold and brass, as finely wrought as lace and varied in shape. Some looked almost like spinning tops, others like spheres tightly trapped in bands of brass and one was but an intricate hollow ring. None were smaller than a great mansion, and all cast their light towards the heart of the device. In the distance lay a massive tower of gears, broad at the base and thinning at the middle only to bloom into an impossibly complex flower of machinery at the summit. Colors flicked inside panes of glass, like storms caught in bottles.

The heart of the Grand Orrery, the lights of Scholomance.

“A wonder like no other,” Angharad murmured. “You spoke true enough, Song.”

“Tolomontera is not so great a sight, I fear,” Song replied. “But keep some of that awe tucked away, as I expect Scholomance will be just as astonishing a sight.”

She patted the other woman’s shoulder and retired, leaving Angharad to stare at the horizon. Soon enough they would be in sight of their destination, and before they did the Tianxi intended on checking her pack one last time. Song would not be caught unprepared by what was to come.

—

The man’s hair was permanently scruffy, so there was no bed hair to use in telling if he’d truly napped through the storm or if his clothes were habitually rumpled.

“One of these days,” Tristan Abrascal said, “you’re going to have to tell me where you’re getting all these maps.”

“Doubtful,” Song replied without missing a beat.

Were she a more poetic soul, Song might have mused over any uniform being put on Abrascal’s stringy body somehow turning messy as a reflection of his soul’s mutinous streak. As it was, instead she fantasized about him being put through a laundry wringer so the rolling pins might iron out every wrinkle and at least some of the terrible ideas waiting behind those gray eyes.

Ambushed by the man on her way back from her cabin, the Tianxi had been presented with an unfortunately reasonable request which had led her right back in it – and now to be pressing down the edges of a slip of paper against the top of her dresser.

Far from offended, Abrascal’s face creased in amusement at her dismissal. It was discomforting how untroubled he seemed by everything, and how closely that matched the Fangzi Yongtu’s description of a man with rules but no principles. You will know them thus: they neither exalt nor condemn, wandering the land without knowledge of the righteous and unrighteous. Like animals they will feed on benefits and flee calamity, heeding no dignity but their own.

Father would have called him a shady bastard instead, which was somewhat less of a mouthful.

Song followed Abrascal gaze as he stared down at the sketched map of Tolomontera – little more than sketched lines – and wondered what it was he was looking for. Seen from above, the island of looked like a fat-heeled boot inclined slightly upwards.

Its southern shoreline ran from the northwest to the southeast in a diagonal cut, all stony beaches and grassy lowlands leading up into increasingly steep hills and finally plateaus – the Ariadnis Tablelands – that were a maze of deep ravines and caverns. Near the collar of the ‘boot’ tall mountains rose, swallowing up about a third of Tolomontera, and atop these squatted the massive silhouette of the Grand Orrery’s heart. It was in that great clockwork spire’s shadow, due south, that lay the hulking shape of Scholomance.

The ancient school fed straight into Port Allazei, which covered most of the boot’s heel and where the Fair Vistas was headed.

“Unless there are farms on the plateaus, that island can’t feed itself,” Abrascal finally noted. “And that port is much too large to still be inhabited.”

“The Watch keeps a presence on the island, but it is otherwise abandoned,” Song acknowledged.

“So we’re looking at an empty ruin of a port city,” Abrascal grunted. “That could into either a blessing or a curse, depending on how we play things.”

Why, Song silently deplored, must it be only this one that showed interest in planning ahead? She would have preferred the quality in another.

“Once we have registered, our priority should be securing provisions and lodgings,” she acknowledged.

Then Abrascal could find out who was trying to sell him, Maryam could get that sleep she seemed in dire need of and Angharad could be sat down for a conversation about how her family’s exploits at sea had likely been funded by slave trade gold and that meant she must watch her words around someone whose kin might well have been sold to fund Tredegar glories.

Then she could begin seeing to her own affairs, which were ever too many.

“Food and a hiding place, huh,” Abrascal grinned. “Why, Mistress Ren, we’ll make a rat out of you yet.”

Ugh. And to think Maryam genuinely found him charming. There was no accounting for taste.

“We may not have much time before classes begin,” Song told him, ignoring the grin. “If so, we will split off to get everything done in time.”

The dark-haired rat leaned forward, rubbing his chin.

“Am I getting Tredegar or Maryam?” he asked.

She would grant that the man was not slow on the uptake. Only a fool would have thought it a sound notion to partner those two if they were to split into pairs.

“You would be comfortable working with Angharad?” she asked.

Though strangely enough he looked aggrieved, Abrascal nodded. Good. She had expected those two to be at odds, but they were cordial enough. That Maryam would be half her trouble was a thoroughly unpleasant surprise.

“I will likely put the two of you on provisions,” Song said. “We’ll see after we dock.”

Between she and Maryam they should be able to sniff out anything too dangerous while choosing a place to stay. Meanwhile Abrascal would ensure that Angharad was not robbed on prices and she would ensure he didn’t get robbed period. The street rat nodded, brow creasing in thought. They were finished with the map, so she tucked it away and politely stated they were done with her rooms.

Soon they would be in sight of Tolomontera, and though Maryam was napping Angharad would be on the deck waiting for them. Abrascal did not object and they headed up together. She found Angharad on the forecastle earlier and the three settled there – the Sacromontan asked about the Pereduri’s experience at sea, as surprised as Song when Angharad revealed it was precious little.

Though she had, apparently, been trained to duel on a ship’s deck in the bay just beyond her family manor.

“The trick is to move with the waves,” she explained. “The footing must be looser than usual.”

Song did not quite have the heart to explain that her advice would be largely useless to anyone who had not spent most of their life refining the art of war. Abrascal was nodding regularly with a fixed smile on his face, for example. And though Song herself had begun the standard training of Jigong militia at the age of ten – and insisted on being taught the sword as well as the spear, against tradition for women – she would admit to being somewhat lost as well.

She had preferred firearms even before her contract ensured she would be a deadly shot.

Silver eyes scanned the distance and there she found what she was looking for. She might not see perfectly in the dark, but she saw at least as well as any darkling – the horizon was not the stretch of black for her it would be to the others.

“Straight ahead,” Song said, drawing Angharad out of some complicated hand movement. “We arrive.”

Her belly clenched in anticipation, for it was on these approaching grounds that her life’s work was to begin, but when she first glimpsed Tolomontera she found there was no room left for nerves. A hundred times Song must have surveyed the worn sketch of a map she’d obtained from Uncle Zhuge, but it did not prepare her for the true sight of it in the slightest.

It was, she thought, as a drunken scholar’s description of the likeness of an island. Rising above the waves Port Allazei with its long, thin stone jetties looked like some city of the dead – vines, grass and trees had returned to reign when men left. The lights of false stars swept in intricate cycles of colored night and day, slices of silver and green claiming swaths of ruin while behind the lichyard city waited the hungry silhouette of Scholomance.

Its great dome loomed tall, surrounded by a cluster of lesser ones and towers enough for a dozen cities – all laced with tall arched bridges and connected by strange, winding rooftops. Hardly a light was lit within the ancient palace, but it hardly mattered for squatting above on tall mountains the Grand Orrery unfolded like the open arms of some sky-swallowing god. Lights flickered and roiled, clouds drifting lazily below as its gears turned and turned without respite.

Song trusted her own eyes, they were of all the world the only thing she would never doubt, but even staring at Tolomontera she could not quite bring herself to believe the island was real. Not until the galleon docked, nestled gently against the stone jetty, and her hand found the chisel again.

There was work to do.

# Chapter 3

Before her house’s demise, Angharad had only twice journeyed at sea longer than a week.

Once while Mother showed her the northern coast on the way to visit their distant kin in House Bethel, the other time heading to the isle of Seler Seithenyn. On both occasions she had sailed with House Tredegar’s trading carrack, the Swift Alder, which as Mother had liked to tell her was neither swift nor made of alder. Though she had made smaller trips to southern Malan several times a year, in truth most of her time out on the water had been when training her footing had been out on smaller fishing boats borrowed for a day, so Angharad would confess to knowing less of ships than a daughter of Rhiannon Tredegar should.

She did, however, know a great deal about ports.

It has once been the hope of her parents that the largest town sworn to Llanw Hall, Patrwm, might be grown into a port to rival Port Cadwyn to the south. The town was nestled against what the locals called Tredegar Bay, and what her father had taught her was a natural harbor. Deep waters allowed for easy anchorage, and the promontory of Hare’s Rock protected the bay from storms. The smallness of the bay and the lack of good roads to neighboring territories had worked against the town, but both these could be remedied with works.

Yet Mother had known that though House Tredegar’s fortunes had risen enough under her stewardship that these works could now be afforded, it was unlikely they would be finished in her lifetime. She had, therefore, instructed Father to see to it that Angharad would be educated in the necessities of a trade port. The noblewoman was not above admitting she had resented the exercise, which had involved much coin-counting and squabbling about rights and privileges – men’s work! – but she had made the bare bones of an effort to learn.

It was how she could now look at Port Allazei and decide it was not a very good port. It was, to start, entirely unprotected. There were no breakwaters or landbridges to protect the jetties from the storms, and though that might be forgiven given what Song had said about how the Ring of Storms kept the elements at bay the state of those docks was not so easily set aside. The waters here were deep enough the galleon could boldly sail in, but the jetties it approached were nothing but twenty thin, spindly lines of stone jutting out from the city.

The causeway they all led into was hemmed in by low walls leading to what appeared to be some kind of overly large customs office, leaving so little space past the docks the causeway would be constantly crowded should the harbor be even halfway filled. As things stood there was only a pair of carracks docked, moored at opposite ends of the jetties. The captain of the Fair Vistas seemed intent on claiming one of the middle jetties, keeping her distance.

Angharad eyed the port again and sighed. The Pereduri was yet awed by the Grand Orrery’s towering spire and looming Scholomance – its towers jutting out like teeth biting into the dark – but the city at their feet appeared to be little more than an overgrown ruin with second-rate docks.

“And what sets you to sighing so despondently, if I may ask?”

Angharad flicked a glance at the man who’d addressed her. Tristan Abrascal still watched his tongue around her, as the lowborn often did around nobles, but she thought it a good sign he sometimes unbent enough to tease her. She walked a fine line around the man herself, not yet certain of the boundaries. In the world beyond the Watch they would have been kept distant by blood and title, but now they both wore the black. How much did birth matter, once you put on the cloak? She was not yet certain, and so she refrained from offering the man used of her comb even though she’d twice had the half-jest on the tip of her tongue over the last week.

“Those jetties are much too narrow,” Angharad opined, leaning against the railing as they stood up on the forecastle.  “It would be difficult to unload large cargo here.”

The gray-eyed man considered Port Allazei in turn, his stare measuring. Sacromonte was one of the greatest ports in the world still, for all its faded glory, so he should be able to see what she had.

“Or even just a large amount of it,” Tristan finally agreed. “This is no trade port.”

His words had the woman past him stirring from her quiet doze.

“It’s meant for defense,” Maryam said. “That wall looks short now, but they would have built…”

The pale-skinned woman frowned, biting her lip.

“Ograda od dasaka,” she said, flicking a glance at Song.

The Tianxi asked Maryam something in a language that sounded like Cathayan, but slightly off. Maryam replied in the same, looking relieved, and nodded.

“Hoarding,” Song translated. “Like a wooden walkway atop the wall, covered by a roof and with arrow slits in front.”

Arrows? How very Century of Loss.

“The jetties are narrow so few warriors can get out once,” Maryam said. “The causeway is small so the press pushes the invaders into the water. This place was built to fight.”

What a wonder, Angharad thought: Maryam Khaimov could speak without adding some sly implication. Perhaps it was Tristan’s presence, for she did seem to make something of an effort to curb her tongue around the Sacromontan. The noblewoman debated making an effort at pleasantry with the Triglau but could not bring herself to offer a surfeit of politeness when she was so certain it would be returned by rudeness.

“I’m no military man,” Tristan noted, “but those walls look to me like any galleon could level them with its cannons from far enough arrows would mean nothing.”

“Tolomontera is an ancient land,” Song said. “It has been settled since at least Morn’s Arrival.”

By which the Tianxi meant the walls had been built in a time before blackpowder made many once-great fortresses into little more than rubble-in-waiting.

“You seem correct in your assessment about the impracticalities around cargo,” Song continued. “There is a lighthouse west of here with a beach where some ships were dragged ashore. I imagine that is where the Watch unloads what the port does not allow for.”

Angharad leaned back, trying to get a glimpse of this lighthouse, but they were close enough to Port Allazei now that the Orrery lights made it difficult to see beyond their span. In truth she suspected that even out at sea she would not have seen what Song did, for those silver eyes seemed to pierce through darkness and illusion alike. One of the Fair Vistas’ fighting contingent – a young man by the name of Emiliano – came to them and shyly passed along Captain Krac’s compliments and that they were soon to dock. Which they could all see, but was only polite to convey.

Emiliano, tall but hunched over, mostly looked at her while speaking and blushed all the while. Angharad replied politely, as was due, but made sure not to smile. Though she would prefer to think watchmen above such things, it was her experience that young men taken with her sometimes took smiles as encouragement. Such a thing could sour, should they then try their luck and learn her interest ran strictly to the fairer sex. It was simpler to keep a distance.

“Our compliments returned to Captain Krac, and my personal thanks for the lending of books,” Song replied. “The trip was swift and pleasant. We have our affairs in hand and will require no escort.”

Emiliano tried to linger, but Song’s cocked eyebrow was a fearsomely disapproving thing and he was soon routed. Song, Angharad thought not for the first time, seemed comfortable in command. Almost as if she were nobly raised, though of course such a thing would not be possible in Tianxia. Angharad was not certain it was wisest for her friend to lead, regardless of Scholomance rules, but she would not deny it was a relief for the burden to be on another’s shoulders.

It would not have occurred to her, for example, to send them all back to their cabins to gather their affairs ahead of docking so they would not get in the way of the sailors as the galleon pulled into port. Her private concerns aside, it was pleasing to have someone with knowledge of the waters they were sailing with their hand on the helm.

The galleon skillfully slid into place close by the jetty, where dockworkers were thrown heaving lines to secure the ship. Heavier hawsers followed until the Fair Vistas was pulled tight and tied. A plank was thrown down after, and a sailor saw them out. Angharad was a little surprised at the informality of it, which must have shown on her face.

“Something wrong?” Song asked.

“I thought the captain would see us off, or at least the first mate,” she admitted.

Maryam let out a snort from behind her. The sound was unkind. Angharad’s teeth clenched, for after weeks of this her patience was waning thin with the other woman. Having been born to a savage land was no excuse for having refused to learn manners since.

“We do not warrant such attentiveness,” Song said, not unkindly. “We are Scholomance students, Angharad, nothing more. Captain Krac commands a galleon, a respected position. We are beneath her notice.”

The noblewoman’s lips thinned, but after a moment she conceded the point. She was used to more amiable treatment from crews, as either the captain’s daughter or a paying passenger, but she was neither on the Fair Vistas. She was but a soldier under the Watch, the same as any other watchman the captain might be ordered to ferry by her superiors. She turned to watch Tristan come down the plank, the man’s stride unhurried as he bit into what looked like a leathery piece of jerky.

Angharad sent him a questioning glance.

“Traded for it,” he idly said. “Want a piece?”

“I will hold out in hope of a decent meal at our accommodations,” she replied. “Though I thank you for the offer.”

“I ever admire optimism,” Tristan told her.

Angharad frowned, for though this sounded a compliment she could not help but feel she had been made sport of. Tristan Abrascal was clever with words, though she sometimes thought he might be a little too clever with them. The kind of cleverness that led men to get in too deep. Regardless she was left with no time to spare for thought on the matter when Song took the lead, hoisting her bag and striding onwards towards the end of the jetty.  Angharad followed, sailors leaving the galleon in their wake and beginning to organize with shouts.

The dockworkers, stout men and women that seemed of mostly Lierganese stock, paid them little attention as the four walked down the causeway towards the structure flanked by walls she had earlier marked a customs house. Angharad had been wrong in this, as she now realized deeper consideration of the matter would have yielded. The island belonged to the Watch and was closed to all others, who would such taxes be levied on?

No, the edifice ahead was something else entirely. It would have been only somewhat accurate to call it a gate, for though it was that it was also much more. The structure seemed about a hundred feet wide and thirty tall, an elegant pale hall on each side supporting a layered rectangular roof of stone. The roof must have been topped by bronze statues, once, but the elements had worn them down to bare bones. It was the wide space between the halls that drew the eye, for seven pillars filled it from floor to ceiling and each was a delicate wonder.

They approached, almost warily, and Angharad’s eyes could not help but flick from one to another. Each was exquisitely carved deep gray slate, marked prominently with the colored heraldry and words of a noble house – though she did not see any lineage’s name. It took her a shamefully long moment to piece it together. Seven houses, watchmen setting aside noble titles? These were not noble lines but the covenants of the Watch. Her steps slowed and she was not the only one.

“Which is which, do you think?” Tristan mused out loud.

“I know mine,” Maryam said. “It’s there.”

She pointed at the rightmost pillar, where lay a blue crescent moon within a white circle. Angharad found the words of the Akelarre Guild ambiguous – Beyond the Horizon.

“The Academy is in the center, as always,” Song shared, tone dry.

Its crest was two diagonal yellow stripes across a hand, Angharad saw. Their words were A Duty and Privilege, though it seemed someone had painted a black line across all the words save ‘privilege’ and it’d only mostly been scrubbed out. The Pereduri marked the sight of a golden tree emblem which must be the Umuthi Society – whose name came from the Umoya word for tree – and its motto of A House of Steel.

She could hazard a guess at which covenant the green laurel wreath belonged, and perhaps the white quill as well, but her attention was commanded by what must be the Skiritai Guild’s pillar. Angharad stepped closer and her fingers gently trailed the simple heraldry, crossed silver falchions. She shivered at the words she read beneath: Gods Bleed, the Militant simply said. The fewest words of any writ beneath a crest, and so lacking in embellishment they felt more like an oath than a boast.

 She was shaken out of her reverie by Tristan’s soft laugh as he stood by the leftmost pillar. What Angharad had thought to be heraldry was only some unevenness in the stone, the pillar’s sole imperfection. Going around to join the Sacromontan, she saw what he had found. Hidden in the shade of the roof a simple black carnival mask had been carved into the slate. Hunt the Night, the Krypteia scrawled below.

Something about the stillness of the gate – even the halls on the side were empty, all bare stone – straddled the line between reverence and eeriness. It was, Angharad thought, as if they had entered a shrine not to some god but to the Watch itself. The spell only broke when she caught sight of movement past the gate. There the causeway continued for a few dozen feet until it ran aground of a squat, square building whose sloping windows were all shuttered tight.

Past the building was a crossroads, both sides of which led deeper into Port Allazei, but black-cloaked watchmen stood guard by a low barricade in the way. More stood guard before the edifice, and one of them caught sight of their crew beneath the gate. She whistled sharply to catch their attention before gesturing for them to approach. Song moved first, the rest following.

“You lot came with the ship that just arrived, I take it?” the tall woman asked.

She had the Tianxi look, much like Song, but her accent was Someshwari. She must have come from those bloody borderlands between the Republics and their greater neighbor.

“We did,” Song agreed.

“Then in you go, ducklings,” the watchwoman said, gesturing at the open door past her. “Straight to Sergeant Itoro, he’ll sort you out. He’s the one at the desk in the back looking like he could use some sleep.”

“Don’t we all,” another blackcloak muttered. “Fucking double shifts.”

There was some laughter from the others, and before Angharad could decide whether this was soldier’s humor or she should be appalled at the lack of professionalism they were ushered through the threshold. Most of the ground floor was a single room, flanked by wooden stairs to the left and what must be a private office at the back. The great room was a collection of desks, most of them groaning under the weight of paper stacks and surrounded by shelves bearing even more of it.

No wonder the shutters were all closed, a single gust of wind in here would mean hours of work.

Sergeant Itoro was not difficult to find. As dark-skinned as the Malani name had implied, he was perched behind a desk with four large manuscripts on it and scribbling on a piece of paper when they approached. He did look like he could use some sleep, Angharad mused. The rings on his eyes were even darker than those around Maryam’s, though given the paleness of the Triglau’s skin Angharad had wondered if hers were merely faint rings standing out from contrast.

The watchman was also, well, small. He could not even be five feet tall, Angharad thought, and was slightly built. They stood before the desk, waiting patiently as he finished the last of his scribbling with a flourish, and only then did he look up at them. Dark eyes took them in, then he cleared his throat.

“Students?” he asked.

“Yes,” Song replied. “We were told you would sort us out.”

The small man blew on the paper he’d been scribing, then set it aside and reached for the topmost of the books on his desk. He cracked it open, lines and lines of ink revealed to Angharad’s eye, and dipped his quill in an inkwell.

“I am Sergeant Itoro,” he said. “You currently stand in the gatehouse of Tolomontera, which you will not be allowed to pass through again this year save for your test. Do you have your affairs at the ready?”

His gaze swept through them, earning nods back.

“Good,” he said. “Now, I must give you a warning. If any of you is not truly a sponsored student whose name is on my list, you are in breach of Watch law for setting foot on a closed island. You will be caught, tortured for information and summarily executed.”

He paused to let his words sink in, leaving Angharad to wonder why watchmen always seemed to threaten execution when she first encountered them. At least it seemed a rote speech for this one, unlike Lieutenant Wen’s elaborate pantomime with Sergeant Mandisa back on the Dominion.

“Give yourself up now and you will be able to keep your life,” the sergeant suggested.

The Malani waited a moment, as if to give them the opportunity to confess. Tristan cleared his throat, getting a hard look from Song that he blithely ignored.

“Has anyone actually ever given themselves up?” he asked.

It would be uncouth to ask, of course, but then Angharad had not. It was purely coincidental her own curiosity would be sated as well. Good man.

“One of the Garrison recommendations thought it’d be a fun lark to pretend she was, make a stir,” Sergeant Itoro mildly replied. “I hope she had a good laugh, I really do. Good enough it’ll carry her through ten years of serving as a rower on a Watch galleass.”

Only Angharad and Maryam were properly sobered up by that answer. Rowers died like flies, and at times were hardly treated better. In Malan there was such a lack of men willing to take up the role that criminals were used by the royal fleet.

“I’ll need your names for the records,” the officer said. “We can handle cabal matters after.”

Sergeant Itoro was efficient about jotting them down, then blew the lines on the ledger and once satisfied the ink would not smudge closed it and reached for another.

“Good, now the welcome speech,” the Malani said.

He cleared his throat.

“There are only three rules on Tolomontera,” he said. “First, students of Scholomance may not kill each other. Second, the sections of Port Allazei marked with red paint are not to be entered. Third, every student of Scholomance must be part of a registered cabal.”

This, Angharad thought, smacked of lawlessness. The well born could be expected to behave by virtue of their education – well, most of them anyhow. Infanzones had not impressed her on the Dominion. Still, what was to guide everyone besides nobles here on Tolomontera? Officers, she told herself. Is the Watch not an army? It felt like a lacking answer. Sergeant Itoro tapped his fingers against the thick leather-bound ledger without seeming to notice.

“To elaborate on the third rule, a cabal must be made up of at least four students but no more than seven. Anyone who is not in a cabal when classes begin will be placed in one made up of fellow spares as assigned by – well, either myself or Lieutenant Bao depending on who has the shift. I do not recommend this.”

Song looked about to speak up, but the sergeant raised a warding finger and her mouth closed.

“A cabal assignment is not permanent,” he continued. “You may at any time request a transfer to another, and should the request be accepted by their captain you will be added to their rolls so long as it would not bring their number over seven.”

He leaned.

“Cabal themselves are not permanent,” he continued, “for should one at any time have fewer than four cabalists its captain will have fourteen Scholomance days to recruit back up to four. If they fail, the cabal is dissolved and its members will be given a grace period to join another cabal. Failing that, they will be assigned to a cabal of spares.”

He paused.

“Ren, you had something to say?”

“The four of us intend to form a cabal,” Song replied.

He shrugged.

“That is your prerogative, and I’ll mark it, but first it is mandated that all students should know their rights,” Sergeant Itoro said. “There is no need to worry if you do not know anyone. Classes will begin in two days, but tomorrow all students present on Tolomontera will gather at Misery Square so that they might mingle and form cabals as they wish.”

His dark gaze sharpened.

“Regardless of what you may have been told, even by a patron, no student can be compelled to be part of a specific cabal and any such agreement made before coming here – even if legally binding – is null and void,” he said. “The purpose of Scholomance is to form a generation of exceptional cabalists, not gild the name of cliques outside these walls.”

Sergeant Itoro squinted at them.

“Knowing this, I now ask whether the four of you want to form a cabal,” he said.

Song nodded, Maryam close behind, and after a heartbeat Angharad followed suit. It was Tristan who held them up.

“I have been told,” he said, “that should a Stripe be part of the cabal they are considered the captain by default?”

The look Song threw him was unkind but Angharad would admit it was a fair question. It implied a certain lack of trust, admittedly, but to inquire about rules was not outright an accusation.

“That’s correct,” the small man said. “It’s considered part of their classes to lead you. You’ll get a deeper explanation of how cabals function when you meet your school patron, but I can say captaincy is not necessarily permanent. An incompetent leader can be voted out and replaced.”

The gray-eyed man nodded.

“Good to know,” he said. “I’m in as well.”

Sergeant Itoro nodded, finally opening the second ledger.

“All cabals are registered under a number,” he told them. “You will be issued a silver plaque with that number stamped onto it, which serves as your identification and the only way for you to access cabal funds.”

Three or eleven might suit, Angharad thought, though the hopes were swiftly dashed.

“The numbers one to fifty were forged in advance, but most students arrived weeks ago so it is slim pickings left,” Itoro said. “You may ask for any number under one hundred not already taken to be forged as a plaque, but that may take a few days.”

Given the warning Tristan had received from his enigmatic mentor, it seemed to Angharad they would have to scrape the bottom of the barrel.

“Which numbers are left?” she asked, leaning forward.

The small man hummed, thumbing through his ledger. He began at the last page, Angharad saw, but all the lines were crossed on it. On the second there was one free.

“Forty-four,” Sergeant Itoro offered.

There was a pause.

“No,” Song flatly said.

Angharad started in surprise at the firmness of the refusal. She leaned closer to Maryam.

“Why?” she whispered.

The Triglau snorted.

“Tianxi superstition,” she said. “Four sounds like-”

“Death,” Song sharply said. “It sounds like the Cathayan word for death. Very bad luck. My ears work just fine, you two, and I tell you now I refuse to be the captain of the Double Death Brigade.”

Truth be told Angharad thought that ‘Double Death Brigade’ sounded respectably fearsome, but she suspected that opinion would not be well received.

“Surely there must be another plaque left,” she said instead, smiling at the watchman.

The Malani had been paging through his ledger while they talked and nodded at her words.

“One other,” he confirmed.

“It’s going to be four, isn’t it?” Tristan grinned.

“No,” Sergeant Itoro said. “That one’s taken.”

Song blinked in disbelief.

“It is?”

The watchman traced the line with his finger, following it to the matching list on the opposite page.

“Yes. It was claimed by Captain Tupoc Xical,” Sergeant Itoro said.

A chorus of groans ensued, not the least her own.

“Well,” Maryam noted, “at least the man knows what he’s about.”

“An acquaintance?” the sergeant asked, openly curious.

“We went through the trials on the Dominion of Lost Things together,” Song answered.

Sergeant Itoro let out a low whistle.

“Heard this year was a real bloody mess,” he said. “Good on you kids. It’ll prepare you better for this place than anything silver spoon free company princes got up to.”

He cleared his throat.

“Still, there’s a reason this one’s the other left,” Sergeant Itoro said as he presented them the ledger.

Following his finger, she saw it was by the number thirteen. Ah, Lierganen did think that number bad luck she recalled. Something about the Second Empire’s fall.

“So Double Death it is,” Tristan said.

Song glanced at him.

“Thirteen is a good gambling number,” she told him. “What do you have against it?”

“First off, there is no such thing as a good gambling number,” he firmly replied. “And second it’s the worst possible luck, Song. We might as well just name ourselves ‘those unlucky bastards’.”

Maryam cleared her throat meaningfully.

“Women can be bastards too, Maryam,” the gray-eyed man amiably informed her.

“You’re letting us all down, Tristan,” Maryam said. “Just gird your loins and call me a bitch.”

“I’m not going to do that,” he replied.

The Triglau leaned back, catching Song’s eye.

“Song, my vote’s on thirteen.”

There was a pregnant pause as the Sacromontan narrowed his eyes at his friend.

“Does it count if I do it on the inside?” Tristan finally asked.

Angharad frowned down at him.

“It most definitely does,” she sternly said. “I will vote for thirteen as well, Song.”

Tristan threw her a betrayed look but it was deserved punishment. A gentleman should not refer to a lady in such a manner, not even in his thoughts or if she was not truly a lady at all. Sergeant Itoro, though they were wasting his time, seemed too amused to chide them for it.

“You can get a plaque forged,” he reminded them. “Anything under a hundred.”

“There will be no need for that,” Song smiled. “We will take the number thirteen. Thank you for your patience, sergeant.”

“It’s either this or doing the rosters, so by all means feel free to keep arguing,” the small man shrugged. “If there are no further objections, I’ll be putting you down for the Thirteenth Brigade.”

The Malani looked hopeful of another argument, but Tristan sighed and caved in. Twice now Angharad had heard someone call the cabal a brigade, which meant it was no coincidence.

“If I may,” she said, “why is it that you refer to the cabal as a brigade? I thought them to be-”

“The Watch doesn’t use ‘brigade’ as a name for a military formation as the Kingdom of Malan does,” Sergeant Itoro cut her off. “We do have the ranks of brigadier and brigadier-general but the first is an administrative rank and the second commands a division, not a brigade.”

“That seems…”

Angharad trailed off, looking for a polite word.

“Pointlessly complicated,” Tristan suggested.

She sent him a disapproving look at the rudeness, however accurate. The small Malani chuckled.

“The Watch’s built from the bones of older beasts, boy,” Sergeant Itoro said. “After the fall of the Second Empire, the wandering bands of Rooks called themselves brigades. When the Watch began to gobble them up the word came along with them, though nowadays it’s for covenanters only.”

He dipped his quill in his inkpot and began writing their names down, stopping at – Angharad leaned forward. Hers?

“Tredegar,” he muttered, then leaned back his chair.

“Soaps,” he called out. “Look in the correspondence box. Don’t we have something for a Tredegar?”

“Get up and check,” a woman called back from the back office.

“What’s that, Soaps?” Sergeant Itoro mused. “Noon and midnight shifts until the end of time, you say?”

Rather inventive cursing answered him. There was the sound of someone cracking open a chest and then some ruffling. A mere minute later a rather tall Tianxi – a head taller than Song, who was not short – strode out, braids askew and a pink stripe on her face like she had been resting her cheek against a table. She had a small letter bearing a red seal with the two-tailed snake of House Tredegar, perking Angharad up.

“For an Angharad Tredegar,” ‘Soaps’ said, passing the sergeant the letter. “Anything else?”

“Plaques for the Thirteen Brigade,” Sergeant Itoro said. “Four of them.”

The woman stomped back through the door to the backroom but Angharad paid it no mind. The small man passed her the letter, which she cracked open. It was not much, only a few lines.

“My uncle confirms he is on his way to Tolomontera,” she told the others. “He also sent me a gift as congratulations for surviving the Dominion, which he entrusted to the local garrison. I need only go to the appropriate warehouse and show this letter to collect it.”

“You’ll need your plaque as well,” Sergeant Itoro informed her. “It should be in the farrago warehouse even if your uncle’s Watch – at the left end of Hostel Street, the building made of kiln bricks right before the turn.”

Angharad inclined her head in thanks. ‘Soaps’ stomped back out of the backroom, returned with a cloth bag she dropped on the table besides the sergeant’s ledgers.

“I only asked for four plaques,” Sergeant Itoro said.

“So I went above and beyond, you might say,” the Tianxi smiled.

She retreated, seemingly in a better mood now. The small man sighed.

“Take your plaques,” he instructed them as he reached for his third book. “I’ll see what I can do for lodgings.”

Tristan’s hands were quickest, undoing the knot keeping the bag closed with what Angharad could only call suspicious deftness, and he held it open for the rest of them. Song reached inside, withdrawing a glint of silver, and Angharad was second. Her fingers closed around a round seal, which she drew out and studied more closely as Maryam went fishing.

The silver was rough more than polished; on one side the number thirteen was encircled by a sleeping, snakelike dragon while on the other a thick stripe ran around the edge of the circle with words engraved in what must be Cantar – the mother tongue of Antigua, now spoken only by scholars. She flicked a curious look at Song, who hedged.

“It is Cantar from the Union period, which I cannot read perfectly,” the Tianxi warned.

“That is still more Cantar than anyone else here can read,” Angharad pointed out.

Seeming pleased, Song flipped her plaque to study the back.

“Thus,” she slowly began to translate, “we – they?- have learned the… secret, mystery? Language, maybe. Of things that breathe and do not, but with the suffix for ‘being’ attached. The rest is numbers, but not a number.”

“Thus I have learned the language of all living things; its name is violence,” Sergeant Itoro softly quoted. “So spoke the harvestman of ruin, toppler of thrones.”

Tristan choked and Song looked surprised. The sergeant traced a circle against the table, an Orthodoxy superstition meant to disperse ill luck.

“Our school words,” the Tianxi slowly said, “come from Lucifer?”

From who? Sleeping God, she could not be serious. For some reason the man seemed to find that hilarious, laughing his fill before wiping his eyes.

“Ah, youth,” Sergeant Itoro said, and none quite dared to ask more.

Gathering herself, Angharad saw that his third ledger was open and he seemed to have made some notes in the margins while they were looking at the seals.

“You will be lodged in the Rainsparrow Hostel,” he informed them. “A single room with six beds. The baths are down the street, if you are so inclined, and all three of the taverns on the street will serve you if show your plaque.”

Before any of them could inquire as to crude necessity of payment, the Malani elaborated.

“Everything is free until classes begin,” he said, “but the taverns keep a drinks tally for each brigade and will charge you if you get too expensive.”

“And after the classes begin?” Angharad asked.

He shrugged.

“You’ll be assigned a patron, they will fill you in as to the practicalities of life in Port Allazei,” Sergeant Itoro said.

Angharad nodded, displeased at the brush-off but aware she was in no place to make demands.

“I was advised to seek rooms in the Emerald Vaults,” Song said. “Could something be arranged?”

The small man snorted.

“You and everyone else, Ren, only they got here weeks earlier,” he said. “It filled up ten days ago. No nice single rooms with a balcony and bath for you.”

Alas, Angharad deplored. Cheated of the comforts of civilization once more, though at least Song had made a valiant attempt on their behalf. Sergeant Itoro scrawled a few words on paper and handed them to the silver-eyed Tianxi, referring to her for the first time as Captain Song.

“Good luck,” Sergeant Itoro told them, and so they were dismissed.

They left the office, back to the street, but Angharad stilled at the threshold. She thought for a moment she had gone mad, for the world looked like a fever dream, but she had not: everything truly was wreathed in green. The false star above that was painting the world in its color slowly passed above them, leaving a light tinged by gold in its wake. Angharad swallowed. The Grand Orrery’s cast had been pale since they left the ship, as if they were under direct Glare, so she had entirely forgot that they were not below a pit.

“That is going to take some getting used to,” Maryam grunted. “It even feels different in the aether.”

Troubled one and all, they put a spring to their step. Though they had not been told of the exact location of the Rainsparrow Hostel, it turned out to be unnecessary. Hostel Street was not all that long, a mere ten edifices – three taverns, two warehouses and five hostels for travelers much larger than those Malani law mandated be built by the side of royal roads. They were stone, too, and the facade positively dripping with statues of sparrows hinted strongly as to their destination.

By unspoken agreement they decided to first claim their room and set their bags down there instead of wandering about burdened.

The Rainsparrow Hostel was an old mass of worn granite three stories tall, its front facade boasting a dozen large double-windows facing the street. Between each of these a statue of a hawk – nesting, flying, clawing at the unseen – was fixed, most of them in fine state. The doors were wide open, leading into a tiled antechamber left empty save for a narrow writing desk behind which sat a bored blackcloak with a massive ledger before her.

Song handed her the paper Sergeant Itoro had scrawled on and was met with a raised eyebrow.

“Itoro must like you, to claim a sixer on your behalf,” the watchwoman said. “I suppose we still have the room – you can have twenty-seven.”

She marked down their names and cabal in her ledger, asked to be shown their plaques and only then went rifling inside her desk to remove two small iron keys.

“Second story,” she said. “Right end of the hall. Oh, and there’s one last thing.”

She cracked open her book to the last page, unmarked, but there a few letters were tucked away. The watchwoman idly traced through them before seizing on.

“Tredegar,” she said. “You’re in luck, you got here in time.”

Angharad took the offered letter, blinking in surprise.

“You seem quite in demand,” Maryam said.

The tone made it ambiguous whether that was an insult or not, so Angharad’s lips thinned as she opened the letter. Unsealed, and she could see why. It was not private correspondence, strictly speaking.

TO LADY ANGHARAD TREDEGAR,

You are cordially invited to an evening at the Old Playhouse on the twenty-eighth of the twelfth, for light refreshments and informal company. We-

She scanned through the rest of lines, lips tightening as she found the very last. Raising her gaze afterwards, she saw expectant looks waiting.

“I have been invited for an evening at the Old Playhouse,” she said. “It appears to be some kind of party.”

“So why,” Maryam said, “do you look like someone just socked you in the stomach?”

Just past the end of the paragraph, the part mentioning she was encouraged to bring a guest along, was the names of those who had invited her. Captain Nenetl, went one.

But the other went Lord Thando. A Malani name. A Malani noble’s name.

“Apologies, Song,” Angharad said. “It appears that I had enemies waiting here as well.”

# Chapter 4

“Not here,” Song firmly said.

The watchwoman at the desk was leaning in, eyes bright at the prospect of gossip. Maryam would not have minded airing out Tredegar’s dirty little secrets, but it was not worth the fight with Song. There was nothing to gain there save the joy of spite.

Up the stairs they went, to a stone hallway with burnt orange carpets. She was charmed to notice little hopping rabbits were hidden in the patterns, frolicking about merrily. There were numbered doors alternating on each side of the hall and stairs leading up at the left end. It never failed to impress Maryam how skilled mornaric – the sailing peoples – were at building upwards. It must be because there were so very many of them in such small spaces, she mused.

Their room was at the right end of the hall, opposite the stairs. Number twenty-seven, though there could not be that many rooms in the hostel. Some kind of local superstition?  Tristan unlocked the door and Maryam was amused to realize she had never noticed him taking one of the keys. Not that he would need it if he truly wanted to enter a room. He’d shown her his kit on the Fair Vistas, between the lockpicks and the skeleton key there was not much short of an aether lock that would ward him off.

The last in, Maryam closed the door behind her. Their room was spacious and clean: six beds, two rows of three against either wall, and for each row a dresser and washbasin. There was a wooden trunk at the end of every bed, a key laid atop it, and facing the street was a broad double window with open shutters. Orrery lights filtered in, coming to rest on a small writing desk stocked with ink and paper, and four unlit oil lamps hung from long iron rods nailed into the walls.

Maryam’s gaze lingered on the slice of silver light lingering atop the writing desk, sending out her nav to taste it. To her spirit-effigy the aether felt… clandestine. A light for thieves and secrets, for ambushes. Every false star of the Grand Orrery carried a will, an order, as if no two Ancients had been able to agree on what it was they were building. Shaking off the thought – and Tristan’s curious look – she slid her pack off her shoulder and let it slump to the ground.

Gods, but she was tired. Her every limb ached. Yet Maryam barely had a moment to roll her aching shoulders before Song turned to Tredegar.

“Kindly elaborate,” the Tianxi said. “What trouble are we in?”

We, Maryam marked. Song was all too eager to drag them all into the Malani’s entanglements. Tristan picked a bed by the windows, abandoning his pack on the floor and dropping down on the sheets. Maryam snatched up her bag and sat on the bed by his, keeping an eye on Tredegar – who was clearing her throat in embarrassment.

“I have been invited to an evening of light refreshments,” Angharad said.

“A grave peril indeed,” Tristan opined.

Maryam swallowed a grin. Ever quick to bite, her viper.

“Full retreat, every woman for herself,” she tacked on without missing a beat.

The Malani – Maryam would not refer to her as Pereduri in her thoughts so long as the girl called her Triglau, for she wasIzvorica and Triglau was a word whose meaning spanned a dozen peoples – narrowed her eyes at them. Stiff-backed, Tredegar passed her invitation to Song questing hand and the Tianxi studied it while the noblewoman deigned to explain her meaning to the rest of them.

“One those who invited me is a noble bearing a Malani name,” Tredegar said. “I have reason to suspect they would be a foe to me.”

Malani were dogs eating their own children, who were they not foes to? They would steal the lights from firmament itself to bejewel their High Queen’s crown, if they but had the reach. All eyes were on Tredegar, even Tristan bothering to sit up on his bed, but now the Malani hesitated. No blabbermouth when it came to her secrets, this one.

Maryam might have reluctantly approved of that, if those secrets were not likely to get them shot at.

“If we are to face your enemies with you,” Song gently said, “it is only reasonable for us to be told of their grudge and nature.”

Hand-holding, Maryam scorned. How gentle a touch this was compared to the Tianxi’s talk with her on the ship. No, that was unfair, the pale-skinned woman decided after a moment. Maryam had brandished her fists first and there was no kindness in a brawl. And most damning of all Song had read the Malani right, for she squared her jaw and got to unpacking her secrets. Maryam would argue with many things, but never victory.

“I belong to House Tredegar of Llanw Hall,” Tredegar said. “Mere months ago, it was butchered savagely and struck from the rolls of Malani nobility by the High Queen’s court.”

Maryam frowned. She had thought that the Duchy of Peredur had its own nobility, called ‘peers’ instead of ‘lords’, but did somewhat recall hearing of Pereduri nobles taking Malani names. Perhaps it was related.

“I know not why,” Tredegar said, jaw clenched, “only that they murdered my kin and parents and spared not even our servants. It was…”

Angharad Tredegar breathed in, breathed out. It would not take shovelwork to dig up this one’s pain. The Izvorica took no pleasure in her grief, but neither could she muster much pity for it. How many mothers and fathers had been butchered and bought on House Tredegar’s behalf, made into meat and cattle to pay for parties and roof tiles and pretty belt buckles? It was evil, what had been done to Angharad Tredegar.

But what of it, when evil had paid for the very boots she wore?

“I survived,” Tredegar continued, tone pained, “and thanks to preparations of my father and the help of an allied house I was able to flee Malan by ship. Assassins have pursued me since.”

A pause.

“The false Yaretzi confessed to having been hired for my murder.”

That revelation came as a surprise. Tredegar had not mentioned it the night when she slew her would-be killers. Maryam looked away, surprised by a pang of sympathy. She knew a thing or two about running ahead of Malani killers, starving and lost. When she looked back to the noblewoman she found her looking away, a faint look of shame on her face. She had missed something.

“Scholomance will not be so easy to infiltrate as the Dominion,” Song finally said. “And even should a student be suborned, killing is forbidden.”

“Abduction isn’t,” Tristan said.

The brown-haired man was still sitting cross-legged on his sheets, but for all the apparent looseness of his stance Maryam saw how his eyes revealed it a lie. They were calm, like a clock ticking on. She would not soon forget that night out by the raised stones, the way his hands had shaken but his eyes stayed unwavering as he spoke of buying his way out of the grave. You could trust a man like that, who rode fear without letting it ride him. It was the only kind of man you could trust, really.

“If I had to arrange it,” Tristan continued, “I’d have Lady Angharad dragged onto a ship and shot in the head the moment we crossed the Ring of Storms.”

Tredegar inclined her head at him, not offended in the slightest by what someone else might have taken a threat. Unsurprising. Malani never gave their word without thinking of ten ways to break it without staining that pile of loopholes they called honor. Still, in staring at the horizon those two had missed the pebble in the boot. Maryam cleared her throat, rising to her feet.

“It’s not a trap,” she said

Tredegar frowned even as the blue-eyed woman went to lean back against the dresser.

“The book downstairs,” Maryam continued. “The one that watchwoman got your invitation from. It had a few more invites tucked in, didn’t it?”

“It did,” Song immediately agreed.

After a moment Tredegar nodded in agreement.

“I bet if we go down and look, all of these will have different names,” she said. “I’d even bet that if we went to one of the other hostels – the Emerald Vaults, Song?”

The Tianxi inclined her head, arms folded.

“If we go to the Emerald Vaults, their ledger in front will have the same set of invitations wedged in,” Maryam said. “The hosts will have them everywhere. There’s no telling where students would be sent to sleep after getting here, so the surest way to reach them is to have those letters waiting in front. Likely they invited all the nobleborn students and you made the list.”

“Then you offer a silver or two for passing word your invitation was received and you’re sure to learn of it on the quick,” Tristan mused. “It’s a sensible method.”

And one that needed no servants to work, just coin. Tredegar bit the inside of her cheek, looking sour. Disapproving of how close it sounded to bribery, Maryam guessed.

“The blackcloak did say I was lucky to arrive in time,” the Malani finally acknowledged. “That implies the evening has been planned for some time and there would not have been much time to scheme between receiving news of my survival on the Dominion and our arrival here.”

The frown deepened.

“But how would they know of my coming, if not through my enemies?” she asked.

Naive, coming from a girl whose watchman uncle had padded every blackcloak pocket on the Dominion to help her survive. No one at Scholomance would be without patrons in the Watch. Even Maryam had one, though he was worlds away from the Trebian Sea and his influence accordingly thin.

“The same way I got on the Bluebell,” Song replied. “Connections in the Watch. I expect your being a mirror-dancer is on your record and that will draw attention. This might well be an attempt at forming ties – or even poaching – rather than anything more nefarious.”

It would have been pleasant to entertain the fantasy of Tredegar being traded for another cabalist – a Lierganen or Tianxi would be best, they tended to be the most tolerable – but Maryam knew better. Song would not allow it.

“I’d still say you pegged it right, Tredegar,” Tristan mused, stroking his beardless chin. “Maybe the ones throwing the party don’t want your head in a basket, but where there’s one noble there’s always more. If a Malani highborn arranged the party…”

“There will be more in attendance,” Tredegar said, fists clenching. “Almost certainly. I must decline attending, then.”

Maryam shook her head, the gesture drawing their eyes. She eased off the dresser, which she had felt begin tipping.

“It is better to siege than be besieged,” she quoted. “If you hole up behind your walls, your enemy is left master of the land.”

“A Triglau war manual?” Song asked, sounding curious.

“The words of a general,” Maryam said, meaning my mother.

Her eyes moved to find Tredegar’s.

“If your foe is as rich and powerful as you think, are they truly someone you can outlast?”

It had been a slower death, retreating to the hill-holds, but still a death. Mother had seen the truth of that even as the kings spoke of ceding Zarla’s Drift and all of Dubrik to the Malani, of abandoning the flat grounds where their muskets reigned to bleed them across the goat paths instead. They would tire of the raids and ambushes, the kings said, and either the mornaric would leave or the old trade would resume. Only the Malani had not tired, had not left. They had built forts, brought settlers and cannons and priests. 

And when the kings finally grasped the Malani were there to stay it had been much, much too late.

Tredegar blinked in surprise, but slowly nodded. There was a tension there that made Maryam uncomfortable, for it was hard to name.

“Fancy,” Tristan drawled. “Back home, we just say that the best way to know what’s inside a beehive is to kick it.”

Maryam would have taken him at his word, if not for the sly glance he sent their captain after.

“That is not a Sacromontan saying,” Song flatly said.

“A Sacromontan is saying it,” Tristan said. “So, you know, by the transitive property of things-”

“That is a law of mathematics,” the Tianxi interrupted, sounding baffled. “How do you even know about-”

Bickering erupted, irritated on one end and gleeful the other, until it was cut right through. Tredegar had chuckled, at first, but it turned into a streak of laughter and then something deep from the belly. Maryam eyed the Malani warily, for the sound was less mirth and more a wound being lanced. She was purging, and when the last chuckles left Tredegar she looked exhausted. All eyes stayed on her.

“Apologies,” Tredegar said, voice hoarse. “I am… tired, I think.”

“It has been a long few weeks,” Maryam said, tone cautious. “For all of us.”

She sent out her nav, feeling out the Malani, but she felt no different from usual in the aether: a mind sharp and narrow, like a blade. Tredegar nodded something like thanks and Maryam’s jaw tightened. She did not want gratitude, not for such a small gesture.

It felt too much like being in the wrong.

Song, who had been leaning against the wall with folded arms since the talk began, suddenly pushed off. Her face was resolute.

“We all have stones hanging around our necks,” Song told them. “It is how we ended up on the Dominion of Lost Things in the first place. I will not pry at secrets – not even a captain can demand this – but threats that might trouble us all are a different matter.”

She paused, silver eyes sweeping through their cabal.

“Angharad has shared hers. It is time for the rest of us to do the same.”

“Are you to start, then?” Tristan idly said.

Too idly, Maryam thought. It was the kind of shallow cheer pulled over anger or irritation. Tristan Abrascal had spent most of life with only firmament above his head and nothing but his feet keeping death from catching up.  It would not be anytime soon he stopped seeing a captain as anything but a hindrance to pay lip service to.

“If you would like,” Song evenly replied, not rising to the bait. “I am a Ren. We are responsible for what the Republics call the Dimming.”

Maryam had long been fascinated by tales of Tianxia, whose Luminaries sounded not unlike the work of the Ancients painting the highlands in wandering light. The Republics were a wealthy realm, she had read, because they lay under great mirror-conduits bathing hundreds of miles of towns and fields in golden light. As there were nine such Luminaries but ten republics, a lottery arranged which land would be left in the dark until the next draw.

But in the latter half of what mornaric called the Century of Sails, one of these Luminaries had been broken.

“Your family broke a ninth of Heaven, you once said to me,” Angharad quietly said.

Face blank as a porcelain mask, Song nodded.

“Chaoxiang Ren, my grandfather, made the decision that brought down the three-legged tower of the Republic of Jigong and broke a ninth of Heaven,” she continued, tone entirely without emotion. “Jigong has since been condemned to the dark as punishment and will forever remain so.”

She swallowed.

“All bearing the name Ren are reviled, regardless of relation to my line, but I am of direct descent,” she said. “My kin had to flee Jigong but hatred heeds no borders. My countrymen will sometimes seek to do me harm without greater reason than my name, and those of Jigong may well attempt to take my life outright.”

That legacy was half the reason they knew each other at all. The sheer novelty of her being warned off sitting with someone at the mess hall had been enough to ensure that Maryam would seek out the Tianxi eating alone in a corner and being treated like she had the plague. The Izvorica had spent a week at the Rookery, waiting for Captain Falade to have the time to appraise her obscuration and decide whether her patron’s recommendation would be accepted, only three days of which had overlapped with Song’s own stay on the fortress-island.

It had been enough for them to strike an alliance of sorts, if only because the way the other candidates waiting at the Rookery treated them made it plain they were short on potential associates. Silence hung in the wake of Song’s words, the severity of her words having made this feel all too real.

Tristan passed his hand through his hair and sighed.

“I have no knowledge of why I am being hunted,” he said, which Maryam suspected was actually true. “But I will say this: I am an orphan and not through happenstance. I will repay that favor tenfold to those responsible – and on that list is the name of a powerful infanzon. That pursuit may yet bring down enmity on our heads.”

That was more than she had expected him to say. Wise of him to steer clear of the name of Cerdan, given that Tredegar was not a fool incapable of basic addition, but sooner or later that would out. Still, by the approving look the Malani was sending him at the mention of bloody vengeance Maryam thought if he played that conversation right he might well end up without a sword in his belly. Tredegar was not a hypocrite in ways too obvious – she would not condemn someone’s revenge in the same breath she swore her own.

Eyes turned to Maryam, the last of the lot, and the blue-eyed woman worried her lip. She had secrets but none that came with foes and her ambitions would remain her own. She did, however, have a… situation.

“I have no great enemies, save what my color will earn me,” Maryam finally said. “But there may be a danger closer to home.”

The pale woman closed her hand into a fist, the wooden fingers she had been fitted with in Three Pines creaking. Half the time she forgot she had ever lost them, then she tried to flip a coin and it was as if she was the world’s worst bungler.

“There is something odd about my signifying,” Maryam admitted. “I have great facility with Autarchic Signs – the rarest and most difficult of the Arts – but struggle with even the simplest manifestations. That is…”

She trailed off.

“There is no such thing as a safe anomaly, in signifying,” she said. “It is a lit fuse whose length I do not know, and if I do not find the root of the trouble there is not telling what will happen when it reaches powder.”

That was the first lesson of signifying, the one every Navigator learned. There is no harmless way to use the Gloam. You have drunk poison and it will kill you: the only question left is how long it will take. Maryam knew it had to be the unusual nature of her obscuration that was responsible for her block, but it should not have – she breathed in, stilled her mind. Now was not the time and this was not the place. She would seek out the local chapterhouse and with it a Navigator’s guidance.

“In time,” Song spoke into the silence, “I hope that we will share details of contracts and Signs so that we might plan accordingly.”

Before anyone could add anything she raised a quelling hand.

“It is early days and we are yet strangers,” she said. “Such things should not be forced. Besides, we have a more urgent consideration.”

Silver eyes moved to Tredegar.

“If you would reconsider attending the evening, there are opportunities there,” she said. “This alleged gathering at Misery Square tomorrow is meant, I feel, for the late and the desperate. The skilled will already have formed cabals and attending such a soiree will reveal who the most influential of our rivals are to be. And regarding foes, it would be best to reveal them by…”

“Kicking the beehive?” Tredegar lightly suggested.

Tristan grinned her way, his pleasure matched by Song’s chagrined look. Maryam resented the Malani’s occasional wittiness, which made her harder to dislike.

“If you are to have enemies, it would be best to learn now and prepare to fight them,” Song pragmatically said. “In this I agree with Maryam – it is better to seek them out than to let them find us. That said, it would be imprudent to send you alone.”

Tredegar flicked the Izvorica’s way, then Tristan’s. A beat passed.

“We should bathe before attending,” the Malani told Song. “And see about getting a fresh uniform, at least.”

Maryam smiled even as Song’s lips thinned. The Tianxi seemed to enjoy it a great deal less when it was her being given accidental insults.

“I cannot be the one to go with you,” she stiffly said. “My name may well be barred from entry, and if it is not then other Tianxi might walk out in answer to my presence – more likely I will be asked to leave, and you would then stand alone.”

Tredegar frowned.

“I would be an entirely different sort of scandal,” Maryam idly said. “Unless, of course, you would ask me to attend as your slave.”

She eyed the Malani with a smile, skin-deep pleasantry, as that frown deepened.

“I would not,” Tredegar said.

“Wise,” she replied.

So not entirely senseless. Perhaps some hope should be allocated to Song’s promised efforts, though Maryam would not hold her breath. Their stare off was interrupted by a chuckle.

“Why yes, Lady Tredegar, it would please me to be your escort at this evening of refreshments,” Tristan drawled. “You do know how to make a man feel special.”

Tredegar cleared her throat.

“Your help would be most welcome,” she said.

“Don’t worry,” the gray-eyed man smiled. “You’ll hardly even notice I’m there.”

Maryam leaned his way.

“I could do with a spare cloak,” she whispered.

“Try to find out if there’s a pawnshop,” he whispered back, “and if they take silverware.”

“What was that?” Tredegar asked, eyes narrowed.

“He was wondering what to wear,” Maryam lied without batting an eye.

“I am not used to the company of nobles,” Tristan added, feigning shyness.

It was little like watching a cat slap a bowl off a table and then pretend it’d been just as surprised as you were.

“Let us find out what the possibilities are, then,” the noblewoman said. “Come, Tristan, the watchwoman downstairs should have some answers.”

The Sacromontan was quickly browbeaten into joining the expedition, looking back mournfully at his still-packed bag, but when he turned to glance at Maryam it was not sympathy she offered. Something with a hood, she silently mouthed. He rolled his eyes, Tredegar dragging him out shortly after, and Maryam was left to stand alone under Song’s disapproving stare.

“Maryam.”

“I will not apologize,” she gravely said, “for thriftiness.”

“Maryam.”

The Izvorica raised her hands defensively.

“I mean, why even have a thief if we don’t ask him to steal things?”

Song sighed.

“If the two of you end up in a goal,” she said, “I’ll leave you there until classes begin.”

That was fair, Maryam conceded.

—

After Maryam put away her clothes in her trunk – neatly, but not so neatly as Song’s meticulous smoothing and folding of everything she owned – she stayed kneeling by the bed, eyes closed. Her limbs ached, a dull throb that somehow urged her to both move and stay still.

“I was thinking of having a look around the port,” Song said. “Would you be interested?”

“I was thinking of napping,” Maryam said.

The Tianxi’s brow rose.

“Did you not on the ship?”

“I keep having dreams I don’t remember,” she admitted. “And when I wake up I’m more tired than when I went to sleep.”

“You need a Meadow,” Song flatly said. “The rings around your eyes have been getting worse.”

The Tianxi wasn’t right, but there were always rules around Meadows. Maryam would try rest in a proper bed first and simply seek guidance from a signifier. It might be something in the local aether that was affecting her like this.

“It was nowhere this bad on the Dominion,” Maryam said. “And I am less than fond of ships, it can’t have helped.”

A pause.

“I will leave you the room and the key, then,” Song said. “But you must tell me if your troubles persist.”

Maryam halfheartedly agreed, and within moments of being alone was lying on the bed. She rose only to close the shutters and then promptly buried her face in the pillow again.

When she woke groaning, a trail of sweat down her back and her heart pounding with dread, she was left to wish she had taken Song’s advice. She changed, wiping her face and neck clear in the washbasin first, and when she came down the stairs found it was no longer the same blackcloak at the desk. A little talking let her figure out that she had been sleeping for at least three hours, not that her aching body could tell.

She left the key at the desk for Song when she returned, then went to take her captain’s advice. The man at the desk gave her a direction for the Akelarre chapterhouse, though it was vague and he admitted never having gone himself. It proved little trouble, for a direction was enough: chapterhouses always had tall walls, enough they stood out from the buildings around them. Maryam had to wander around for a time, looks and whispers trailing her wherever she went, but a few minutes of walk to the west and she found what she was looking for.

Most chapterhouses were built the same way: a fat, stout square bastion whose sole entrance was at the end of a narrow ramp reaching halfway up the wall. It made getting anything in and out difficult, but the Guild cared for secrecy over practicality. The Navigators had not remained the leading practitioners of Gloam sorcery for five hundred years by being careless with their secrets. Here the structure was granite, and all the old houses around it had been pulled down into rubble as if to forbid cover.

Breathing out, Maryam set up the ramp and past the open gates of the chapterhouse.

There was no writing desk inside, no ledger or list – not even ink for a quill. Instead the square room, covered in obsidian tiles of subtly varying shades, counted a bench on either side and an open door past them. There was nothing at all to stop Maryam from going right through, save for the middle-aged man sitting with crossed legs on the left bench and reading a book. Lierganen, she saw by the skin, and while his hair was long and wild his beard was neatly cropped.

He did not look up as she entered, absent-mindedly turning a page.

The man was not wearing a cloak but he had a regular’s uniform, tunic and trousers and boots, and a small knife strapped at his side. No embroidered officer’s stylings on the shoulders, but Maryam went still as stone when her eyes found his left hand. The signet ring on his hand was silver. The Akelarre Guild had ranks, but the ones that mattered weren’t the ones you got on your clothes. Your signet ring was what told you where stood, and silver meant you were a Master within the Akelarre Guild.

No wonder the man wasn’t taking guarding the entrance seriously. If he had taken the time to prepare the room with Signs, he would be able to fry her mind without even bothering to look up from his book. Intrigued by what such a skilled signifier might be reading – a metaphysics study, perhaps, or some ancient book of lore – she risked a glance at the title emblazoned on the front. It was…

‘The Sunflower Lord’s Lady’.

Maryam let out a small sigh. A romance serial. One of those cheap and tawdry ones, too, which watchmen always seemed as eager to trade as liquor and gossip. At the sound of her disappointment, the man finally looked up from the page.

“Maryam Khaimov,” he said, dark eyes knowing. “Come for the Meadow?”

She blinked in surprise. Were there really so few Navigator students on the island that he would recognize her at – fool you, Khaimov. However many Navigators there might be, she would be the only Izvorica. Of course he had recognized her.

“For the night,” she agreed.

The man nodded.

“You know the rules,” the Master said, eyes already back on his book. “Barefingers get only one night every five days. And if you are to stay over, there will be no avoiding sitting with Captain Yue this time.”

Maryam’s brow rose.

“This time?”

The blackcloak’s eyes stopped moving across the page. He looked up, face gone serious as he watched her face for something. Whatever it was, he did not seem to find it.

“What is my name?” he asked.

“You never mentioned it,” Maryam flatly replied.

His lips thinned.

“I did,” the Master retorted. “When you visited for the first time, two hours ago.”

The blue-eyed woman froze.

“I,” she began, then swallowed. “I was sleeping in my room. I cannot have been here.”

Unless, of course, the Eclipse was coming early and she simply did not remember. It would be ridiculous, she had only obscured a single organ but… Ridiculous was not impossible, and her obscuration was unusual. The wild-haired man closed his book with a snap, rising to his feet.

“You need to have your obscuration assessed immediately,” he said. “Yue has the Meadow, follow me.”

Maryam swallowed, mouth gone dry, and meekly nodded. The man flicked a wrist behind them, Gloam running off the obsidian tiles in thick rivulets and forming into a Sign hanging in the open space of the chapterhouse gate. Not a Sign she knew, but Maryam could feel its malevolent pulsing without even calling on her nav.

“Come,” the man said. “And before either of us forgets-”

He caught her eye.

“My name is Baltasar Formosa. Remember it, as I will be your professor in the Akelarre classes.”

—

A Meadow was, against what would be the expectations of most outside these walls, exactly what the name implied: a small field of greenery with a stream running through it.

Most chapterhouses used flowers and herbs from the surrounding lands, and there was no true rule as to what must be within save that it must live and there must be water running through. Maryam had known some chapterhouses to turn their Meadows into medicinal herb gardens or to grow spices, but Captain Yue evidently preferred nature to run its course. The land here was prickly green grass and wildflowers, overgrown ferns crowding the edge of a small tinkling stream. The vines on the wall were digging into the stone, like fingers looking for weakness.

The only sign of order was the small mattresses laid down on both sides of the river, their sheets neatly made and their pillows in place. Maryam allowed herself a pang of longing at the sight but mastered herself, for she might have come to rest but now the purpose had changed. Professor Baltasar had led her briskly through the cramped halls of the chapterhouse and was now taking her straight to a woman sitting cross-legged in the grass.

Captain Yue hardly even looked thirty, though it could be hard to tell with Tianxi. She was broad of shoulder but slightly built, black hair pulled in a braid on the left side of her head – and half-hiding the nasty burn scars on her cheek and ear. Her black coat was open, revealing a billowy white shirt, and her boots had been carelessly tossed behind her. She breathed out, then opened curious brown eyes without needing to be told of their approach.

“Baltasar,” she said, voice smooth as silk. “You bring me our last errant pupil.”

The professor grunted.

“That remains to be seen,” he said. “She just told me she’s never seen me before. Apparently she was sleeping in her room when I saw earlier.”

Captain Yue cocked her head to the side and Maryam straightened beneath her gaze, not quite sure why she felt the need. She felt a tenseness in the air, a weight, but she did not dare send out her nav. The captain bore silver on her ring finger, she might well smother Maryam’s spirit-effigy without noticing. The older Navigator let out a hum.

“She’s not possessed,” Captain Yue finally said. “Have her emanations been varying on the way here?”

“Stable,” Professor Baltasar replied.

“Then you have brought me something interesting,” the Tianxi happily said. “Sit with me, Maryam. Let us find out if you have begun going mad.”

The tanned man leaned closer.

“Try not to interest her too much,” he whispered. “She is not malicious but her curiosity can be… callous.”

The Izvorica slowly nodded. The professor left with that warning, sparing the captain a nod which she airily dismissed. Maryam stood there a moment, awkward, before clearing her throat and sitting by the other woman as offered. Captain Yue offered her hand, which Maryam reluctantly took. Her stomach clenched.

“Loosen up,” the captain said. “Do not take the reins of your logos even if you do not move it.”

She breathed in, breathed out, and then Captain Yue’s nav – the logos, Navigators called it – was under her skin. It was like a cat’s tongue, rough and warm, as it rose up her arm examining every inch. Up to the shoulders, then the head where she lingered long, then down the other arm and the rest of the body down to the sole of her feet. When Captain Yue finally withdrew Maryam was left feeling raw, like an exposed nerve.

“Nothing has breached containment,” Captain Yue informed her. “Your brain will soon be fully obscured so I would begin considering which organ will follow, but there is nothing that would cause a sudden onset of mania.”

Maryam let out a slow, relieved breath.

“It is quite fascinating, seeing someone who began with their brains,” the Tianxi mused. “It’s not unique, of course, but that you did it before puberty without going violently insane is most impressive.”

The Izvorica closed her mouth, biting down on the reply that it was the tradition in the land of her birth and her mother had done the same. She had been warned not to attract this one’s interest.

“Your dossier mentions a block when it comes to manifestations,” Captain Yue continued. “How do you do with Didactics?”

“I cannot get them to work at all,” Maryam admitted, then defensively added, “but I have had some successes with Acumenals.”

The Tianxi hummed.

“It will be difficult to tell whether you have mangled your logos somehow or there is a mental element to your difficulties until you have begun obscuring a second organ,” Yue said. “Have you planned your journey in that regard?”

Journey, that was that the Guild called it. A pretty word, but its real meaning was ‘death’. Gloam was a poison that would kill you, sooner or later, drive you mad and hollow you out. Only the ancient practitioners that had founded the Akelarre Guild had discovered the process of obscuration, and it had changed everything. Simply using Gloam spread the damage all over your body, slowly saturating with few external signs until a sudden onset of mania.

To obscure, however, was to saturate a single part of her your body with the Gloam.

Not only did confining it to a single organ somehow allow a signifier to concentrate much more of the Gloam inside it than should be possible, it also yielded a stark improvement in manipulation capacity – and, depending on where had been obscured, some affinity with a part of the Arts. Maryam had obscured her brain, which would help her with Autarchic Signs. Those confined within the signifier, with an emphasis on the mind.

Most Navigators never obscured their brain. It was difficult, dangerous and rumored to lead to… instabilities, especially if done early in one’s career. And of course it was, for Maryam’s teacher had never hidden from her what obscuration was, when you stripped away the mystical trappings. The controlled hollowing of a part of the body, he’d called it. We turn ourselves into darklings, piece by piece. Maryam shivered at the memory and licked her dry lips.

“If not a bout of mania,” she said, “what can explain Professor Baltasar having seen me earlier?”

“Tolomontera is sitting atop one of the largest aether wells of Vesper,” Captain Yue said, sounding pleased. “Odd happenings are not only likely, they are to be expected.”

She paused, thoughtful.

“Perhaps your presence caught the fancy of some entity in the aether?” she said. “Or it might have been a reflection of you from a different time, or even a part of your soul strengthened by lower order entities?”

The captain was warming up to the subject the more she spoke, eyes alight.

“I cannot wait to find out,” Captain Yue enthused. “To think I would be so lucky as to be handed so delightful a puzzle this early in the year.”

Callous curiosity, Professor Baltasar had called it. Maryam’s estimation of the man’s judgment went up a notch. Perhaps some of the thought showed on her face, for the captain’s enthusiasm was visibly pulled back.

“But I have held you back long enough,” Captain Yue said. “Pick whichever bed you will Maryam. The Meadow is open to all.”

Tiredly thanking the other officer, Maryam dragged herself up. She picked the bed furthest from the captain, but after that huddled under the sheets without even taking her boots off. Head on the pillows, she felt the grass around her breathe and the water flow – the currents of the world quieted, the encroaching dark kept at bay.

She was out in moments and it was the best night of sleep she’d had in months.

# Chapter 5

The watchwoman handling the ledger at the front of the Rainsparrow Hostel was named Valentina, and she helped them with the enthusiasm of someone whose hour would otherwise be ferociously boring. It turned out that one of the warehouses Angharad had noticed on Hostel Street was earmarked for student supplies, including a set of three fresh uniforms.

“You could pick up your field kit as well, but I’d wait until you spoke with your patron for that,” Valentina said. “They’ll advise you on what else to pick up at the same time.”

“Is there a way to learn who our patron is to be?” Angharad politely asked.

If there was a proper way to go about her affairs she would prefer to follow it, but in the absence of such guidance she was being left to guess. Angharad never much enjoyed guessing. Father had loved riddles, and often deplored her general dislike of them.

“Normally the officer who sorted you out should have sent you straight to them,” Valentina mused. “It probably means yours hasn’t arrived at Port Allazei yet. I hear the Master of Arms is running a few days late, they could be a passenger.”

Tristan leaned close to the Pereduri, though not quite enough to touch or even for his breath be felt. Sometimes she thought him half a ghost, to so rarely let himself be felt.

“Is your uncle not supposed to be coming soon?” he murmured.

Angharad bit down on her excitement, knowing it premature. Uncle Osian being their patron would be a grand thing indeed, but for him to have acquired the wealth he’d allegedly spent on her protection he must either be highly placed in the Watch or heavily indebted. Either way, could he truly afford to spend years on this island out in the middle of nowhere?

“It would be a pleasant surprise,” she finally replied.

She did not lower her voice, as speaking privately when engaged in conversation with a third party was impolite. The noblewoman then lowered her head in thanks to Valentina.

“Thank you for the advice,” she said.

The older woman dismissed her words with a vague gesture.

“No trouble,” she said. “And if you’ve the time, I recommend that you spend a few coppers getting your informs adjusted at the warehouse. There’s a tailor there and it’ll help with impressions if you’re to dine with free company princelings.”

Tristan leaned in, like a hound with a nose to the scent.

“Been hearing a lot of ‘princelings’ this and that being thrown around,” the man said, his Sacromonte accent suddenly gone thicker. “Don’t suppose you could help a friend out as to the meaning?”

Valentina eyed him amusedly.

“Most don’t take Murk mud as a slip to flash, boy,” she said, then raised an eyebrow. “What gave it away?”

Had Tristan noticed something, then? Angharad was somewhat at a loss as to what it might be.

“You put your ledger entries in the middle,” he replied. “Like all coterie bookkeepers.”

“It’s neater that way,” Valentina said, sounding peeved. “And if you align it to the left the Tianxi always get pissy.”

Cathayan, Angharad remembered, was read from right to left. She said nothing, content with staying out of Tristan’s way given that he did not seem to have given offense. The watchwoman sighed.

“Something to keep in mind, and well worth a warning,” Valentina said. “Since you’re both obviously fresh to the black, I’ll let you in on the way things go. After a few decades, free companies end up one of two ways: corpses or filthy rich.”

Angharad frowned, for that seemed a narrow case, but in truth she could not recall ever hearing of a small free company. Only half a dozen operated in the Isles, and of those a mere two were based near the Kingdom of Malan – those two, however, could field armies and fleets that would dwarf those of any single izinduna. An alliance of great lords would check them, surely, and the High Queen could destroy either with a single order. Yet it could not be denied they were both powerful forces.

Supposedly the continent knew smaller free companies, particularly in Izcalli and the Someshwar where there was always work for Rooks, but even these would be at least a few hundred men strong. More soldiers than Mother had ever commanded even when leading an exploration flotilla.

“Any company that had the pull to send students to Scholomance will have been around for ages, and it’ll have leading officers wealthy as lords,” the watchwoman continued. “It’s their kids they’ll be sending here, black-cloaked princelings used to having the run of private armies.”

Valentina leaned her chin against the palm of her hand.

“I’m pretty sure that Thando boy is from the Singing Jackals, and by reputation they’re a real piss-in-your-porridge kind of outfit.”

Angharad’s brow rose, for that name she had indeed heard of. The Singing Jackals were the largest free company to take contracts in Malan, said to be headquartered at an island off the south-east of the Middle Isle. They were also, more importantly, rumored to have connections with the High Queen’s court. Even if this Lord Thando did not turn out to be an enemy, he would know that House Tredegar had been struck from the rolls of nobility.

A discomforting thought.

They both thanked Valentina for her words and took their leave. The warehouse first, Angharad silently decided, but she could use a distraction from her worries. She turned a look on Tristan as they began to walk.

“You mentioned,” she said as they walked out of the hostel, “that the bookkeeper of these ‘coteries’ write ledger entries in the middle of the page. Why is that?”

He looked at her with that strange look of surprise he sometimes put on. It came and went at the oddest times, she had yet to figure out the reason for it.

“Coteries never run a single set of books,” Tristan explained. “The scriveners will fill the middle, then when they’re to send the numbers up the ladder they’ll copy them on the left side and cut that part of the page off.”

Angharad almost asked why they would not simply buy a second book to write the copy in until she recalled that these coteries were petty criminals and paper was not inexpensive.

“Then what is the last third for?” she asked.

It was not a long walk down the street, but it struck her as odd such an important location would be so deserted. Of the half-dozen people in black cloaks moving around Hostel Street only two were young enough to be students, the others likely from the local garrison.

 “Depends who you ask,” Tristan snorted. “Bookkeepers, they’ll tell you it’s so there’s room to put their notes and corrections in.”

The expectation was clear.

“But,” Angharad gamely said.

“If you ask coterie boys, they’ll tell you it’s the ghost ledger,” the man said. “The real numbers, which the bookkeepers skim off of and hide in their notes.”

The noblewoman frowned. Even criminal bookkeepers should have greater integrity than that. And if not morals, then at least sense.

“Are coteries not brutal killers?” she asked. “It seems unwise to rob them.”

“A good bookkeeper’s precious enough coteries bosses usually let them get away with skimming if they keep it small and quiet,” Tristan said. “It’s hard to find folk learned in numbers willing to run Murk books.”

“I do not understand,” Angharad admitted. “Even the poorest would attend-”

Ah, she realized awkwardly. Other realms did not have the isikole, the four years of schooling all children of the Isles went through except if their parents secured an exemption – as Mother had for her. The poor of the Sacromonte likely could not read or write the way they would in Malan, much less do arithmetic. Tristan looked intrigued.

“Is it true all Malani children are made to attend school, then?” he asked. “Sailors said as much, but I always figured they meant children from good families. Or those who could pay, at least.”

“I was told that in the larger cities some children slip through the cracks,” Angharad admitted. “But the attempt is ever made. The isikole is one of the foundations of the kingdom.”

Not that all such schools were the same. Some nobles donated to the red roofs raised in their lands, or paid for more roofs to be raised so they would not be as crowded. The lessons stayed largely the same, however, though if one cared for rumors it was said that in Uthukile any school teaching children The Peace of Nine Oaths – the seventh of the nine Great Works – would keep accidentally catching fire until it ceased to do so.

Angharad had never read the work but Father said it covered the many wars between the kingdoms that had united the Low Isle and the Middle, often painting the former as the devils of the tale. Malani books will always teach Malani lessons, he had told her. The work was said to be more flattering to the ancient Kingdom of Peredur, perhaps because its many princes had warred with each other more than they ever did the rulers of the Middle Isle.

Angharad shook her head, chasing off the reverie. The Isles were far away, and she would not see them again for many years. They would keep while the current matters would not.

The warehouse was a stooped pile of masonry that seemed almost expectant, though the inside was covered with wood paneling. The front was a long counter behind which several doors stood closed, manned by a tall Someshwari woman who was half-heartedly playing a game of Patience, cards laid out in front of her. She looked up when they entered, no more pleased with them than she was with her game.

“What do you need?”

“We are freshly arrived,” Angharad said. “We come for our uniforms.”

“Stay here, I’ll see if Sergeant Andres has the time,” the watchwoman said, then narrowed her eyes at them. “Don’t touch my cards.”

Angharad cocked an eyebrow at her and nodded, saying nothing as the Someshwari yanked open one of the doors and disappeared into a dimly lit hall beyond it. Tristan, who had promised nothing, leaned over the counter to have a look at the cards.

“She’s stuck,” he reported.

“She is on shift,” Angharad said disapprovingly.

If the Someshwari was so bored, she should have found something useful to do instead of waste her time in such a manner. Card games were for evening parties, not the hours sworn to service. By the time the watchwoman returned Tristan had distanced himself from the counter, though they still both got a suspicious glare.

“He’ll see you,” she said. “Plaques.”

They duly handed them over, and after snorting at the number she handed them back. They were ushered into a cramped room at the back of the warehouse, full of closest and stacks where piles of black clothes of differing sizes waited in quantities that could be described as significant. Sergeant Andres turned out to be a white-haired old man with a limp, Lierganen in looks, accompanied by an assistant – a small girl that could not have been older than twelve.

“Sit, sit,” Sergeant Andres wheezed. “Let’s get you properly attired.”

The old man had a leather stripe marked for measures and began with Tristan, taking notes about shoulder length and the span of his legs while sending off the girl to fetch the sizes. As soon as the Sacromontan was sent off to dress in closet the sergeant was on her, Angharad standing patiently as he took her measures. It was a familiar feeling, though Emyr – Llanw Hall’s household tailor – had been half this Andres’s age and much sprier.

“I hear that the uniforms can be adjusted for a fee,” Angharad said, glancing down.

“Which?” Sergeant Andres asked. “There are three kinds, my girl, though I could certainly work on all three if you feel the need.”

It turned out that Angharad had already encountered two of the kinds of uniform without knowing it. The combination Song and Maryam had taken to wearing on the Fair Vistas – tunic, undershirt, trousers and cloak – was what Sergeant Andres called the ‘regular uniform’.

“Most students come already owning such a set, or even a few,” the old man said. “If that is not the case for you, they can be bought here at a discounted price.”

She nodded, grateful for the information, and got a frown in reply.

“Did your patron not inform you of this?”

“I am told they might not have arrived on Tolomontera yet,” Angharad said.

Sergeant Andres tssked disapprovingly.

“You’re not getting someone from the garrison, then,” he said. “Unlucky you, though given that number on your plague you asked for it.”

Angharad did not roll her eyes at the Lierganen superstition, but it was a near thing. The sergeant kept talking as Tristan returned and was measured again, explaining how the combat uniform – the fighting fit, he called it – had a similar foundation to the regular but wore over the tunic a knee-length overcoat of impressive thickness and collared cloak. Sergeant Mandisa had worn that same kind of coat back at the Old Fort, Angharad recalled.

Once she and Tristan had both been fitted for such a uniform, the old man measured them for the formal kind.

“It is rather decorative,” Sergeant Andres said. “Unsuited to exercise. They’ll only have you put it on for a few ceremonies a year, so if you take proper care of it you might not need a second for your time at Scholomance.”

The centerpiece of the formal uniform was a collared long-sleeved black jacket, buttoned in silver and reaching halfway down Angharad’s thighs. It sat tightly over a pale shirt, belted at the hip, pulling tight at her belly with a silver buckle. She’d had her pick of color for the stripes going down the side of her baggy trousers – choosing green – but the stiff, polished black boots they were tucked into were not negotiable. The old man offered her additions for it.  

“A fitted capelet is most common,” he said. “Though the ornamental pauldron is popular, and cloth wraths for the leg have been in some demand – matching your stripe, of course.”

He casually added that these would have to be bought with personal coin or brigade funds, which was when Angharad frozen. She realized, all too late, that she did not actually have any coin on her – not that she had any left – and had not formally requested Song’s permission to draw on brigade funds. In truth she was not even sure that such a thing could even be done instead of withdrawing brigade coin from wherever it was held.

Shuffling away from the old man awkwardly, she cleared her throat as she saw Tristan pack away his formal uniform. Did he not intend to wear it? It was certainly her choice for the evening.

“I know that look,” the gray-eyed man said, leaning in. “Is it about a dead body or a loan?”

Angharad cleared her throat again. Why would she need help with a dead body? Presumably, she would have been the one to make it, making any need for aid well past.

“It occurs to me I have no funds on my person,” she reluctantly admitted. “I was wondering if perhaps…”

“Loan it is,” Tristan said. “I’ll cover you for the fitting, but I doubt I have enough at hand for that fancy pauldron you were eyeing.”

Disappointing, Angharad would admit to herself. It was most striking and would have added a certain flair to her jacket. Still, she would not complain of a favor being done to her.

“Thank you,” she said. “Shall we agree on the rate?”

The man coughed into his hand, as if choking.

“I am not going to charge you interest on a couple of coppers, Angharad,” Tristan said.

He seemed somewhat appalled.

“I’m not a–” he began, then smoothly changed tack halfway through the sentence, “- well, I’m not that kind of thief.”

The reminder of his past crimes was unfortunate, though his honesty was praiseworthy.

“You do me honor,” Angharad stiffly said.

“I do you for the price of a couple unripe tomatoes on Cato street,” he replied, tone dry. “Let us not get too excited here.”

He seemed unaware of that statement he was making by refraining from a rate: that he considered her honorable enough to put a debt above all other considerations and repay it as promptly as she could. An honor reserved for only long-standing friends among nobles. A heavy compliment, and one whose severity made her uneasy. She had not considered them so close, though by accepting she would state it was so. On the other hand by refusing she would insult them both, which was no better.

That Tristan must be entirely unaware of how neatly he had trapped her only made it worse. It was like being beaten at tabula by someone unaware they could capture your pieces.

“Thank you for the loan,” Angharad forced out.

He was of her cabal, she would have needed to learn to treat him as trusted comrade regardless. This was merely another reason to do so, not some skilled maneuver she had fallen to. With funds secured she had her formal uniform adjusted by the old watchman, who used her as a lesson for the girl that might be as much an apprentice as an assistant. Tristan declined to have one of his own tailored, to her surprise. He was skinnier than most clothes his size would account for.

Sergeant Andres did quality work and at an impressive pace. Angharad was much satisfied with the way her shoulders were let out and the trousers better fitted to her legs. As they were done with time to spare before the evening began, their next destination was all the more obvious: the bathhouse was on the right end of Hostel Street, which Sergeant Itoro had earlier mentioned.

There were separate public baths for men and women, but Angharad was also pleased to find there were bronze bathtubs in private alcoves. Tristan did not resist the suggestion of a wash, or when she strongly suggested he comb his hair.

“A doomed effort, but I shall make a valiant attempt,” Tristan assured her with a grin.

Angharad went back and forth carrying a bucket to fill her own bathtub with near-boiling water from a great tub, rejoicing at the thought of a proper bath after all this time at sea. The heat and humidity of the room were oppressive at first, but she grew used to it after settling in for soak with a jar of fragrant oils – lavender and jasmine – for her hair and a sweet-smelling soap . A pleasant surprise, that latter part, though she supposed it sensible that good Trebian soap would be cheaper when dwelling within the Trebian Sea.

Though she could not spare the time to truly luxuriate, Angharad left her bathtub feeling cleaner than she had in months. She carefully dried and braided her hair – in a simple way, though she would ask Song help for a more elaborated do on the morrow – and then tried on her new formal uniform.

Eyeing herself in the mirror of the bathhouse changing room, Angharad decided it would do. The fit was still a little tight around her shoulders, but that was on purpose. The cut made her seem curvier than she truly was but was not uncomfortable and left room for bindings. Satisfied she was presentable, she belted her saber and doubled back to the front hall.

Tristan was waiting there for her, leaning against the wall in his own fresh clothes. The fighting fit for him. She would have thought that unwise were she not looking at it, but in truth thickness of the overcoat made him look bulkier while allowing the wrinkles in the cloth to seem intended. In a formal uniform he would have looked like a skinny rat, Angharad mused, but under the overcoat and collared black cloak he looked like a true man of the Watch.

“Shall we?” the Sacromontan asked.

She nodded. It would not do to be late. They returned to the Rainsparrow Hostel to put away their dirty clothes and those unused, but Song had left a message for them with Valentina. Maryam was asleep, she wrote, and so she asked for them to leave their affairs in a storage instead. Song herself volunteered to bring their property up to the room when she returned from her exploration of Port Allazei. It was inconvenient, but Angharad decided not to be a lout and conceded the matter.

Besides, Song had left another line and a half at the bottom of the paper. Learn what you can about the other cabals, she instructed. Look for potential allies. If you cannot make friends, then make an impression. Angharad slowly nodded to herself. This she could do. It was not so different from Mother telling her to be friendly with the daughters and sons of houses she wanted to be on fair terms with. Tristan had already put away his affairs when she emerged from her thoughts, waiting for her outside.

“I asked around about where this Old Playhouse is when you were still in the baths,” Tristan told her out in the street. “It is only a few minutes of walk from here, I broadly know the way.”

“Then lead on, Tristan,” Angharad said, pulling at her collar.

It felt tight, but not as tight as the coil in her stomach.

—

The walk took longer than anticipated, largely because they took their time to look around.

And why not? It was yet early and this was their first look at Port Allazei. Angharad found the streets strangely broad, as if this were a city made only of avenues, but soon realized that the neighborhood around the docks was much different from the rest of the city. It was maintained and inhabited, seemingly full of barracks and warehouses and shops. Further out, revealed by stripes of light in red and gold, she saw how Port Allazei crumbled into ruin. Collapsed walls, trees piercing through broken roofs and vines so thick they covered the cobblestone streets like a carpet.

“A dead city,” she said.

“But still used,” Tristan replied. “There are paths through the ruins kept carefully open. The Watch runs patrols here.”

“What against?” Angharad wondered.

“That,” he mused, “is the question, isn’t it?”

The Old Playhouse was near the edge of that ring of inhabited city, enough that beyond it were a handful of collapsed shrines whose debris made the streets unusable. From a distance the structure looked like nothing more than a sloping stone hill split by sets of stairs, though lights and drifting sounds made it clear that it was the right place. The pair hurried up the side of the hill, and once they reached the crest – at the apex of the stairs – their steps stuttered.

“I expected something like a Liergan playhouse,” Tristan said.

“So had I,” Angharad admitted. “This is… different.”

Even as far as the Isles the Second Empire had built a few of their famous playhouses, those massive half-circles of stone benches leading down to a raised stripe of marble where the actors played out their roles. Angharad had not gone to the capital as part of the dueling circuit so she never saw Navaron’s Eye, but she had gone to Kalundi in the southwest and there the Lierganen had built an impressive edifice that still stood strong centuries after the last stone was laid.

The Old Playhouse was nothing like what she had seen in Kalundi.

It did not rise but instead descend, at least in a manner of speaking. Ancient artisans had taken what must have been a low but wide hill and carved the outside, the great length of stone covered with now-faded reliefs and strange symbols. Three sets of stairs rose up the slow, wide and pristine, and at the summit of the hill was where the road veered off: the inside had been hollowed out. Three concentric rings of lodges – the largest being the highest – filled the inside, almost like tiers.

At the very bottom one last ring, a circle on the floor, must be the stage for the playhouse.

Once upon a time the lodges were meant to be separate, for between them stood small walls topped by flat roofs of delicate ironwork made to look like vines, but nature had since decided otherwise. Grass emerged from cracked tiles, trees had overtaken walls and vines bearing fragrant flowers covered everything like a tapestry. The three rings looked like long gardens full of little nooks, and indeed were being treated as if they were.

On the bottom floor a handful of cloth pavilions had been raised and tables set beneath them, laden with glasses and small plates of colorful bites. The tables were attended by a few servants in plain clothes, but the true draw to the eye was the guests: every last one in Watch blacks, but each uniform tailored and subtly different. There must have been thirty of them, none looking older than Angharad by more than a year or two.

They chatted and laughed by the pavilions, though some seemed to be taking pleasant walks around the lowest ring of lodges. It looked, Angharad thought, like a garden party. The same kind she had attended for much of her life, though the guests were admittedly more varied.

“There’s Tianxi down there, so it cannot be a strictly noble gathering,” Tristan noted. “And going by looks, no one nation is leading the pack – odd, that. This should be someone’s game.”

Angharad’s gaze narrowed.

“It isn’t. Have you ever worn a tailored uniform, Tristan?”

“I’ve never worn a tailored anything,” he amusedly replied, “unless you count my stitching rips back together.”

Truly, not even a shirt? How expensive could it possibly be to have a shirt tailored, the Pereduri wondered?

“Getting it fitted to you does not take long, not even work more elaborate than what the tailor did earlier,” she told him. “Yet a simple fitted of uniform is not what they are wearing down there. I see at least half a dozen different styles – see the man with the silk half-cape, or that girl with the layered sleeves? That sort of thing takes time, a skilled artisan and coin.”

Gray eyes narrowed.

“Fashion,” he said. “You mean this is blackcloak fashion.”

In a way, that was a relief. It meant that when Angharad saved up enough coin to acquire finer clothes, there would be shops suited to her need. The notion of the children of mere military officers being a sort of Watch nobility seemed odd, but it was also logical in a way. The Rooks could not recruit their captains entirely from foreign nobility, it was natural they should rear up their own.

“Come,” she enthusiastically said. “Let us find out more.”

This was an event arranged on school grounds, not a proper reception, so Angharad did not feel slighted that no servant was waiting for them was they began the trek down. The pair winded through the garden paths of the first two rings, going round and round, until they came across a small pavilion at the beginning of the third where awaited a smiling Lierganen man in a neat but plain tunic. He was holding a small book and a sharpened length of charcoal.

“Good evening,” the servant said, his Antigua smooth to the ear. “Might I assume that one of you comes bearing an invitation?”

“I do,” Angharad said, producing the letter.

She passed it to Tristan, who passed it to the man without batting an eye. The servant inspected it for a moment, then inclined his head.

“Lady Angharad Tredegar and…”

“Tristan Abrascal,” he completed. “Thirteenth Brigade for both.”

The wince on the servant’s face at the mention of the number was gone so quickly she almost thought she had imagined it.

“Master Abrascal,” the man completed. “I welcome you on behalf of Lord Thando and Captain Nenetl, who arranged this small get-together.”

He paused, allowing time for them to nod their thanks.

“Please enjoy and mingle with the guests as you please,” the smiling man continued. “There will be a small speech at the close of the evening, but no other demands will be made on your time. This is an informal event.”

The servant moved out of the way, inviting them to proceed through the ring garden, and Angharad put a spring to her step. Tristan followed but she felt him glance back after a moment, letting out an interested noise. She cocked a questioning eyebrow.

“He’s writing in that little book of his,” the Sacromontan said. “Too much for it to simply be our names and brigade. I’d give it good odds he’s some kind of sniffer taking a look at everyone come through for our benevolent hosts.”

“He could simply be jotting down our arms and bearing,” Angharad said, a touch reproachfully.

The man flicked a glance her way.

“Could be,” he agreeably replied.

Tristan was hiding his doubt skillfully enough it would have been unfair to be miffed at him. Very unfair. It was purely accidental when the overgrown roots of a tree forced Angharad to cut ahead and her saber’s sheath slapped against his leg. He yelped, rolling his eyes at her most insolently, but then his face turned serious.

“We are getting close to strolling guests,” he said. “I expect that at an evening like this I’d be a stone around your neck, so I’ll make myself scarce.”

Angharad stiffened, back going ramrod straight.

“You are my guest, and neither unmannerly nor foolish,” she said. “None can honorably object to your presence at my side.”

“I think that might be the nicest compliment someone has paid me in years,” Tristan amusedly replied. “But there’s no need to feel as if you are abandoning me, Tredegar. I’m here to watch your back and look into things, both of which will be easier if you are not holding my hand.”

Angharad almost contested the matter, but she knew it would be guilt speaking if she did. Guilt at having felt a silver of gratification at the prospect of being able to enjoy herself with peers for an evening without the need to shepherd a lowborn man through high society. It was not desertion, she told herself, if to separate served their purposes better. It was following a plan.

“Then let us do so,” Angharad said. “Shall we leave together, at least?”

“Best not,” Tristan said. “I might duck out early to follow the trail.”

She cocked her head to the side.

“And what trail would that be?”

“The servants handling all this,” he said. “Where are they from?”

That, Angharad thought, was an interesting question. No student should be allowed to bring servants, she thought, and birth would make no difference in this. Strictly speaking Angharad had not been a titled lady since her house was struck from the rolls of nobility in Malan, but she had since given up the title anyhow by enrolling in the Watch.

It was a fine line for her to even be called Lady Angharad, though by not attaching the name of a holding – such as her lost Llanw Hall – it could be considered that to call her a lady was merely a courtesy title. Besides, she had been invited by an alleged ‘Lord Thando’ so she was clearly not the only one using such a styling.

“Then Sleeping God watch over you, Tristan,” Angharad told him.

“Draw first, Tredegar,” he easily returned.

Was that a traditional Sacromontan blessing? She would commit it to memory, it had a rustic charm to it. They parted ways after a bend in the gardens, each taking the different side of a lightning-struck tree, and within moments she had lost sight of the gray-eyed man. Even knowing Tristan had once been a thief, she thought that his knack for disappearing into the background was rather impressive.

Continuing down the garden path alone, Angharad greeted a few other guests wandering the opposite way as she came across them. Merely polite greetings, not even introductions, as that would be improper before she had found her hosts. She lightly went down the last flight of stairs and headed for the pavilions, few eyes turning to her – though some did – and before she could even begin her search she was intercepted.

The pair approached her together and she must admit that they were, at first glance, a humorous match.

The man was a short, skinny Malani with flabby ears dragged down by too many golden earrings. Though his face was more plain than ugly, he had a large wart at the corner of his left eyebrow that drew the eye. The woman, by contrast, was as tall as she was corpulent. Aztlan of look, though more tanned than either Tupoc or Yaretzi had been, she had startlingly delicate features. Like a doll’s face had been screwed atop a rounded waterskin.

A second look, though, corrected the impressions. The Aztlan – Captain Nenetl, she would guess – had the callouses of someone who had trained in the sword for years and she moved with a fluidity belying her size. As for the likely Lord Thando, there was an intricate green tattoo on the side of neck whose pattern she dimly recognized. Those sharp geometric shapes within curving patterns were a mark of honor, an award given out by izinduna to those who had done a great house an even greater service.

A man to be wary of, if he was her enemy.

“Lady Angharad, I presume?” the Aztlan woman asked with a smile.

Her teeth were crooked, one broken, but her voice was smooth as honey. She was one of those fortunate souls blessed with a natural speaking voice.

“Indeed,” Angharad replied, sketching out a short bow. “Would I be speaking to Captain Nenetl?”

“Nenetl Chapul,” she confirmed. “Captain of the Third Brigade. And by my side-”

“I can introduce myself, Nenetl,” the man snorted, then offered Angharad a bow. “Lord Thando Fenya, at your service. It is always a pleasure to encounter a fellow Malani on these distant shores.”

A long history of having been given such ‘compliments’ by Malani nobles allowed Angharad to keep her smile from going stiff. The man would not have meant any offense, even if any Pereduri worth their salt would have found it. Instead she tried to recall if she had ever heard of House Fenya but drew a blank. It was not a famous house, at least.

“The pleasure is mine,” Angharad replied. “I am as surprised as I am pleased by your invitation.”

The two shared a smirk.

“Your presence is not unexpected,” Lord Thando amiably said. “We make it a point to keep an eye for any promising recruits from the Isles.”

“She doesn’t know who you are, Thando,” Captain Nenetl said, sounding amused. “Your ‘we’ must seem rather mysterious.”

“I must confess I am somewhat at a loss,” Angharad said.

Only somewhat because she had been warned of the man’s possible connections earlier.

“Ah, my apologies,” Lord Thando said, yet smiled like a well-fed cat. “House Fenya is not well known but you might have heard of the Singing Jackals.”

The noblewoman’s brows rose. So Valentina’s supposition had been accurate.

“I have,” she said. “The largest free company to take contracts on the Isles.”

“The largest of all the free companies, some say,” Lord Thando proudly told her. “My uncle, Captain-General Wela, leads it. My line has long been a source of high officers for the Jackals and it is our company’s practice to recruit from Malan first and foremost. There was great interest when your name came up, Lady Angharad.”

The Pereduri’s face smoothed into a pleasant mask. Was she about to be shamed, outed as a fallen noble on her every first Tolomontera evening? The others had convinced her that this evening was not likely a trap laid by either of this pair, but she must remain wary. Wary enough to keep smiling even as she prepared for the knife.

“That is flattering, my lord,” she said.

“Do cease, Thando, you can try to poach her for your cabal on your own time,” Captain Nenetl drawled. “Most here in the Playhouse will know more than they should, Lady Angharad, as many are from families whose blood runs black. I myself am the granddaughter of a brigadier from Lucierna – the closest Watch fortress and the seat for this region’s Garrison administration.”

“Though with the son of Lucierna’s own marshal being a student, she cannot claim to be the best connected in that regard,” Lord Thando added.

“He is not here tonight,” Nenetl replied, a tad sharply.

They were not allies in truth, Angharad decided, merely a pair that had chosen to pool their resources to arrange the evening. That was reassuring. If this was not a common front, it was less likely to be a vessel of ambitions not common – and Angharad had done nothing to earn hatred from the officers of a fortress she had never heard of before tonight. Her two hosts made conversation with her a little longer, but they had an obligation to entertain and soon took their leave. Before doing so, however, Lord Thando took her aside.

“I am of the Eleventh Brigade,” he told her. “Do come to us if you encounter any trouble at all, Lady Angharad. It would please our captain greatly to welcome you as one of us.”

Song had been entirely correct, it seemed. The open attempt at poaching from another cabal felt unseemly, but she reminded herself that to do so was not against the rules of Scholomance. That it felt uncomplimentary might simply be her wariness of the man coloring her impression. Angharad wasted no time after that in heading towards the tables, for her throat was parched and in truth she could do with a nibble.

Besides, Song had asked her to learn what she could about other cabals and it was easier to approach strangers around such gathering places. Before she could so much as consider a drink, however, she was stopped by the sight of a familiar face. Lady Ferranda Villazur, her hair pulled in the usual bun that did no favors to her strong chin, stood there in a tailored formal uniform as she picked out a cup of wine.

“Ferranda,” Angharad called out, surprised.

The infanzona turned in surprise, a smile lighting up her face when they recognized each other.

“Angharad!” she exclaimed. “I had not heard your ship arrived. This is a most pleasant surprise.”

“We docked but a few hours ago,” Angharad replied. 

“Just in time, then,” Ferranda said. “This evening has been on the cards for weeks, you would have lost out in missing it. All the leading brigades have people here, and I expect there will be much wheeling and dealing over drinks.”

She snatched up a cup, offering it with a questioning look. Angharad took it – by the smell it was red wine. The dark-skinned noblewoman cocked an eyebrow.

“Are you then here to intrigue as well, Captain Ferranda?” she teased.

A guess, but Ferranda Villazur was sponsored by the Academy and so likely the leader of her cabal. The infanzona laughed and did not deny the title. A confirmation.

“We are rather beneath their notice, at least for now,” she said. “Most brigades past thirty are latecomers, the chaff of this harvest. We are close, as the Thirty-First Brigade, but still in the range.”

A raised eyebrow was directed Angharad’s way.

“What plaque did you end up ordering, anyhow?”

“We did not order,” the Pereduri said. “We claimed Thirteenth Brigade.”

Ferranda winced.

“My condolences,” she said.

“Is the number truly so unlucky?” Angharad asked, reluctantly amused. “You are not the first to react this way.”

“Thirteen years, emperors and treacheries,” the infanzona quoted. “There is no luck worse than-”

She was interrupted and half bowled over by a tall man in a formal uniform, who Angharad found as familiar after a heartbeat.

“Ferra, you will notbelieve who I just ran into. Tristan is here. Abrascal, I mean, not the man from the Forty-Fourth.”

Lord Zenzele Duma was openly enthused as he recounted this, a look at odds with the grimness of his face. There was thick scar where he’d lost his eye, though the hollow was not empty: a rounded metal eye filled it, skillfully painted over. Only it was not in the warm brown of the Malani lord’s own gaze but an eerie pale that Angharad would not soon forget.

It was the color of Tupoc Xical’s eyes, after all.

“Oh, apologies,” Zenzele began when he realized he had interrupted. “I am – Lady Angharad?”

“That would make two of us,” Angharad drily replied.

He laughed, even as Ferranda rolled her eyes, and offered his arm to clasp. Angharad did, mood much improved by the warm reception. She had not known where they would stand, once the common threats of the Dominion no longer hung over their heads.

“A most welcome surprise,” Zenzele said, then leaned it. “I do not suppose you could tell me why the first words out of Tristan’s mouth were a question about the provenance of the grilled cutlets?”

The Pereduri paused. The silence stretched and she was forced to smile embarrassedly.

“I fear not,” Angharad said.

The pair traded a knowing look.

“Still underfoot, then,” Ferranda said. “As was to be expected.”

“Well, he is a Krypteia student,” Zenzele replied.

“We can’t all be good upstanding Laurels like you,” the infanzona teased.

“You are to be of the Arthashastra Society, then?” Angharad said. “I did not think to ask before you left Three Pines.”

“I am,” the nobleman replied, reaching for a drink. “Diplomat track, though our patron tells me the distinction grows muddled here on Tolomontera.”

“Ironic.”

All three of them turned towards the source of the word. A Malani, Angharad saw, and one who had high birth stamped on his bearing. The stranger was tall and lithely muscled, braids going down halfway to his back and his uniform barely cousin to what it must have once been. His black overcoat was made loose and without buttons until the waist, wide open and revealing a thin red silk shirt that bared a slender stripe of skin down to slightly above his navel. He wore a silken half-cape and a blade at his hip.

A lovely saber, and though somewhat ornate Angharad noted the leather grip was worn.

“I beg your pardon?” Ferranda asked.

“It is ironic,” the man smiled, “for the likes of this one to believe he could ever be a diplomat.”

Zenzele frowned.

“I do not know you,” he said. “What I have done to earn such words?”

“I am Lord Musa Shange,” the man sneered. “That name will mean nothing to you, but this should help: my mother is sister to the mother of Lady Arafa Sandile.”

Angharad had only heard that name once, but even had she not clearly recalled it the way Zenzele stilled would have told her who was being spoken of. The other half of the arranged marriage he had fled from, the one with a daughter of the proverbially wealthy House Sandile.

“Yes, that Arafa,” Lord Musa coldly said, the reaction not escaping his notice. “You broke the heart of my favorite cousin, Duma. Shamed her in the eyes of every lady in Malan by running off with some whore instead of wedding her as was your duty.”

Zenzele was a fair fighter with sword and pistol, Angharad knew, but she had never considered him a threat. It was not without reason the man had gone into a scholarly covenant.  The look that came to his face when Ayanda was called a whore almost had her reconsider that opinion: searing hatred, like closing a fist around hot coals.

It was the look of a man who would make it slow.

“So you are a dog of House Sandile,” Zenzele disdainfully said. “That explains the manners.”

“I would return your insult, but even dog would be a compliment to the likes of you,” Lord Musa said scornfully. “I see at least your strumpet did not even make it to Scholomance – though what else could be expected of a bedwarmer? – but it offends me to see you walking about as if you belong here.”

The Malani noble leaned forward.

“This is an evening for honorable company, Zenzele Duma,” he sneered. “By what right do you attend?”

The altercation had already begun drawing eyes to them. Other guests turned to watch, some even drifting closer, but Lord Musa did not seem to mind.

“It is not for you to decide who attends the evenings of others, Malani,” Ferranda coldly said.

“It is not for a Sacromontan to speak when real nobles converse,” Lord Musa dismissed.

Lady Ferranda’s hand drifted to her rapier, which the man noticed with a smirk. As if daring her to draw, Angharad thought. Musa Shange’s words and actions were not dishonorable, for he was avenging the slight on a kinswoman’s honor, but they were… needlessly provocative. He did not speak like a man who was seeking resolution: he was picking a fight. Not that he would have the time to get into one, Angharad noted as she watched who was approaching from the corner of her eye.

“And what appears to be the trouble here?”

The hosts made their appearance. Captain Nenetl, who had been the one to speak, seemed irate. Lord Thando’s face was but a pleasant mask – in mood, if not in looks.

“You let in an honorless cur, Thando,” Lord Musa said, ignoring the Aztlan entirely. “An honest mistake, I am sure, but it need be remedied.”

“That is a grave accusation,” Lord Thando said. “What has you make it?”

“It does not matter,” Captain Nenetl sharply interrupted. “No trouble is to be allowed on Playhouse grounds.”

“Is honor trouble to you, Nenetl?” Lord Thando lightly asked.

The glare she turned on her fellow host was dark indeed, and in a heartbeat Angharad made out the whole shape of this. She had seen that game unfold a dozen times before, after all, just outside dueling grounds when noble children gathered for games almost as pointed.

Lord Thando had not arranged for this, but now that it was happening he was weighing the benefits and choosing accordingly. Which was worth more: the favor of his Lord Musa, or of Zenzele’s cabal? Captain Nenetl evidently saw nothing to gain in allowing this at all and was glaring at the man with heat, but she was only half the hosts. She could not put an end to this if she stood alone.

And as Lord Musa Shange raised his voice to tell the other guests of Zenzele’s misdeeds, her old companion defending himself as best he could – calling Musa a thuggish fool, the ‘old matter’ of indifference to Rooks – Angharad knew that a duel was in the making. Lord Musa had pushed hard for it and would not give up. Reckless, she thought, only half-listening to the public argument. He provoked Ferranda as well, as if the fight matters more than who he is to be fighting. But why is he so sure he will win?

It was when Lord Musa turned to address guests up in the garden, half-cape fluttering, that Angharad found her answer. Hidden away under the silken cloth, she had glimpsed a sheath. A parrying sword, she realized. Musa Shange was a duelist. That was why he thought victory certain, and Angharad was not sure he was wrong. The noblewoman hesitated.

A lesser noble’s place was not to meddle in the conflicts of great lords, she had always known that. Yet Zenzele was no great lord, Lord Musa neither, and this was not Malan. Yet Angharad did not speak only for herself, she was part of a cabal, and to intervene… If you cannot make friends, make an impression, Song had tasked her. Would it not be doing both, to lend these two a hand? The warmth of their greeting was no reason to act, she knew that, but surely this could be considered a strategic decision.

Surely, she repeated, setting down the cup of wine she had yet to touch and leaning towards Ferranda.

“Bait,” Angharad whispered. “The man is a duelist.”

The infanzona’s eyes narrowed.

“Certain?”

The Pereduri nodded and the other woman cursed.

“He wants to kill Zenzele’s reputation,” Ferranda guessed. “Right from the start. Make him a pariah with Malani for the rest of our time here.”

It occasionally served to remember that for all that House Villazur had been minor nobility, Ferranda had been raised to be its lady and been familiar with the likes of better-born men like the Cerdan brothers long before they came together to the Dominion. She was no fool, for all her lack of dutifulness, and hardly blind.

“He wants a fight,” Angharad agreed. “And will get one.”

The infanzona’s jaw tightened.

“I cannot ask you to-”

“You forget,” she cut in, “who that Sandile coin was spent on.”

Before Ferranda could answer she stepped away, idly coming to stand before the still-orating lord. Musa Shenge frowned at her interruption.

“Step asi-”

“You claim,” Angharad said, “to speak for House Sandile?”

“I do,” Lord Musa replied. “By virtue of shared blood.”

“Good,” she nodded. “Then we have matters of honor to settle.”

Zenzele, who had been watching her with surprise, caught on first.

“Lady Angharad,” he stiffly said. “I can settle this myself.”

“Then do so when I am finished with him,” Angharad mildly replied, matching Musa’s gaze. “An assassin in Sandile employ poisoned me and attempted to murder me in my bed, Musa Shenge. If you carry that house’s honor on Tolomontera, I call you now to answer on their behalf.”

Lord Musa laughed.

“Found another girl to trick, Duma?” he mocked, eyes flicking Zenzele’s way. “You must be halfway decent in bed if she’s willing to die for you.”

The noblewoman’s face tightened. It was, unfortunately, still too early in the process to slap him across the face.

“My name,” she said, “is Angharad Tredegar. Insult me again and I will not consider honor satisfied with first blood.”

Musa eyed her with an insolent smile.

“That accent – Pereduri, is it? I thought I smelled rotten fish and mediocrity, there’s the mystery solved. As for first blood…”

The Malani pulled back his overcoat’s loose right sleeve, revealing three black lines tattooed on his arm with the first beginning at the wrist. There were murmurs in the crowd, for Lord Musa had just revealed he was not simply a duelist but three duels deep into becoming a swordmaster.

“Perhaps it is you that should worry of that, Tredegar. Trot along now.”

Only he did not get the answer he had expected, for Zenzele let out a quiet laugh and answered Ferranda’s quiet question with a nod as Angharad herself began to unbutton her jacket. She would have dropped it on the ground, but a passing servant took it up instead and folded it neatly. Praiseworthy service. Without a word, she rolled up the left sleeve of her white undershirt. Ten silver lines were bared, the last at her elbow.

Lord Musa Shange went still.

“Let us have an exchange, Musa,” Angharad calmly said. “In deference to your inexperience I would offer to use my left hand, but I am as able with it as my right. So how am I to make this sporting, I wonder?”

Her gaze cast around the tables, past the bottles and glasses and the dishes. There was a cutting knife by the roast she considered, but right besides it was what would cut deepest. Angharad took a step towards the table and deftly took out a butter knife, wiping it clean against the edge of the butter dish before turning back to her opponent. There were a few laughs and much excited conversation. Lord Musa went red-faced.

“You dare,” he hissed.

“What are you complaining about, Shange?” she said. “I am to use the tool for its stated purpose: cutting through butter.”

It was too much of a provocation. The man drew his blade – a single-edge saber like hers – then revealed his offhand. The traditional parrying blade for dueling, which meant he was a classical Malani fencer. The kind of opponent she was most familiar with facing. Angharad untied her sheathed saber from her hip and tossed it at the man’s feet, adding the insult of throwing the blade as well as the sheath when requesting a duel.

It had the implication she believed herself capable of killing him with what she yet held, in this case a butter knife.

And more than that Lord Musa, having pulled ahead of the formalities in the throes of his anger, was forced to sheathe his saber back to be able to undo his parrying blade’s sheath and toss it at her feet. The fumbling earned him some unkind laughter from the crowd, further reddening his cheeks.

“First blood or surrender,” Angharad stated. “Let us hope you will last at least two passes, after all that strutting.”

“You will have no mercy of me,” Musa snarled.

Angharad loosened her stance, widening it and pointing down the butter knife. Even for a duel to first blood it would have been arrogance on her part to take up that particular armament, if not for one thing. The Malani raised his blade and Angharad glimpsed-

(Three steps, she feinted for the side and he stepped in to hit her forehead with his own.)

She breathed out. Talon School, then, only they were so eager to throw hands during bladework.

(Three steps, she feinted to the side. When he stepped in she moved quicker, kicked out his knee. He struck up, cutting into her flank with the parrying blade as her knife slid on the coat.)

Thick cloth, she thought, the butter knife would not bite at all unless the angle was just right. But she had seen enough to act. Angharad raised her weapon, and as Lord Musa sneered she stepped forward.

One step, two, three – feint to the right.

Fluidly, like a snake striking, Musa Shenge snapped forward. But her polished boot was already moving, kicking out his knee under him. Half a stumble forward, the angle spun off, and his left hand struck – only Angharad had stepped aside, caught the wrist of his saber hand and without batting an eye bent the arm behind his back. Lord Musa shouted in pain and surprise, forced down to his knee, and Angharad aimed the blow perfectly.

The thin point of the butter knife went right through the seams of the coat, into flesh.

“No,” the Malani rasped out. “How-”

Angharad’s fingers tightened around the butter knife and she ripped it out of his shoulder. The man screamed, blood spurting out and splashing his coat. She stepped away before she could be stained, flicking the blood off the dull blade as stumbled back up to his feet. She looked him up and down as he took a fearful step back, his hand on the spurting shoulder.

“Go clean yourself up, Musa,” Angharad said. “A nobleman should have standards.”

She had not aimed for an artery so he should live. If he was lucky, he might even keep most the range of motion with the arm. He pulled back, as if wanting to flee but too ashamed to give way publicly.

“And one last thing,” she called, stopping him in his tracks. “Should you ever again imply I am my friend’s bedwarmer, the ensuing first blood will be a blade halfway through your brains. Nod if you understand, Musa.”

The look he shot her had brimstone enough to rival Pandemonium, but he was too fearful of the wound bleeding him dry to draw this out. Musa Shange nodded, gritting his teeth.

“Good boy,” she thinly smiled. “You may leave, now.”

“This will not be the end of it, Tredegar,” he snarled. “The Ninth Brigade will have answer.”

“I shall endeavor to find a larger butter dish, then,” she shrugged.

He looked as if she had slapped him across the face. Arguably it would have been kinder on her part to do so. Angharad was no great wit, but victory made derision easy to even the clumsiest of tongues. And as Lord Musa Shange slunk away like a whipped dog to get his shoulder looked at, it was as if the entire crowd exhaled. Noise erupted, not the uncouth clamor of a mob but the contained excitement of good society at the aftermath of a spectacle.

When she turned to face her acquaintances Zenzele’s face was resigned, and Ferranda’s unreadable. Angharad hesitated, now considering she might have pushed the matter further than either desired. It had been in their name, not hers, but… She was interrupted by their approach.

“Thank you,” Zenzele quietly said. “But I’m afraid I might have dragged you into greater trouble than you know.”

She raised an eyebrow.

“Is there something unusual about this Ninth Brigade?” she asked.

“Its captain is Sebastian Camaron,” Ferranda said. “He is the son of Lucierna’s marshal.”

“I have heard that Lucierna is near this island, and of some importance in the Watch,” Angharad acknowledged. “But he is only a student while at Scholomance, surely.”

Zenzele leaned closer.

“Around a quarter of the soldiers garrisoning the island was transferred from Lucierna,” he whispered. “And much of the supplies coming to Port Allazei first go through there.”

Angharad’s eyes narrowed. She understood that family came first, but what they suggested sounded rather beyond the acceptable lines.

“I doubt either of us could have beaten a fledgling swordmaster,” Ferranda said. “You have my deepest thanks for your intervention, and our hand in friendship twice over. Yet I would not be offended if you made peace with the Ninth, Angharad, I want to make this clear. Our troubles need not be yours.”

“Song is captain, so that is not my decision to make,” Angharad admitted, then flicked a glance at the stairs Lord Musa had fled up. “Yet I see no need to make apologies to a man who implied me a whore and insulted the duchy of my birth. If not for the rules of Scholomance, I might well have killed him.”

She had never killed in an honor duel back in Malan, but had she been given such strong insults she might well have done so.

“He did come on strong, didn’t he?” Zenzele mused. “Knew the rules about killing and so thought himself beyond consequence, I imagine. We will all need to learn the lay of this place.”

Neither would hear of parting ways after this, and so when she began the rounds it was with the help of the pair to make introductions. It was a whirlwind of names and faces, most of which were excited to speak about the duel and gossip but nothing more serious. Angharad was not overwhelmed. It was little different from being introduced to any other social circle, though instead of a cousin or an aunt it was Zenzele and Ferranda who made the introductions.

She did not learn much of use, in truth, save that the captain of the Forty-Ninth Brigade – a tall Tianxi – was insistently curious about who else was part of the Thirteenth Brigade. Suspecting enmity for Song, she avoided the matter and turned the questions around until he left in open irritation. She encountered her hosts again, naturally. Lord Thando found cool reception from all three of them, and gracefully excused himself. He knew the ways of this game and that his choice would have consequences before making it.

Captain Nenetl, on the other hand, found better welcome and she herself was noticeably friendlier than when she had first met with Angharad. It soon became evident why.

“I expect dear old Sebastian will be on your backs about this,” Nenetl idly said. “He always has been – if you’ll forgive my language – a right prick.”

All three facing the Aztlan captain were highborn, so the picture was not difficult for either to paint. Nenetl Chapul, whose grandfather was a powerful officer in Lucierna, saw the captain of the Ninth Brigade’s even more powerful connections there as an inconvenience. It would be best for her if he were sidelined, perhaps even recalled, and she came to hold the greatest influence over the Luciernan contingent.

Captain Nenetl seemed quite interested in making ties with those who might oppose her rival, and though all knew better than to commit to anything the conversation was promisingly friendly. Perhaps a dinner would soon be organized.

Once they parted ways, Angharad realized with a start that she was smiling. Not at how the night had gone, though it had gone well enough to her eye, but because she felt… at ease. Comfortable. The faces and the rules were not the same, but she knew this place. This kind of night. It was almost like coming home, in a way, and it would have been a lie to say she was not enjoying herself.

If not for the black everywhere, she might think she had never left Peredur.

It occurred to her then she had not seen Tristan in at least an hour, but a look around yielded no trace of her comrade. Had he already left? Most likely he had, ever underfoot as Ferranda said. There was no need to feel guilty. Still, she excused herself from the other two so she might claim a new drink and perhaps have another look around for the Sacromontan. Only within a moment of taking her first sip of some pale cup of wine, Angharad was approached.

“Ah, the heroine of the hour is all alone. I must take advantage.”

She turned at the words, and then paused to take in the sight.

The stranger was nearly as tall as Angharad herself, though narrower at the shoulders and not as strongly built. She was, however, blessed with a full figure that the cut of her uniform made evident – she wore the same kind of collared, knee-length tunic as Maryam but it was tailored to flatter and instead of buttons a very narrow open oval beneath the collar dipped almost down to her sternum. It did not reveal anything save a stripe of smooth, dark skin but hinted at much.

Fitted black trousers and slender boots matched the black of the stranger’s tunic, though there were red accents on the side of the trousers and her belt was a length of intricate colored beads. She wore not a cloak but a velvet capelet, and the golden bangles around her wrists clattered together with a pleasant tinkling sound as she offered her hand.

“Captain Imani Langa,” she smiled.

Angharad took the delicate fingers, bowed and pressed a soft kiss against the knuckle. When she straightened it was to find Captain Imani’s smile had broadened.

“Lady Angharad Tredegar,” she replied. “The pleasure is all mine.”

“A bold claim, after the entertainment you have just provided,” Imani laughed. “It is a rare thing to see even a fledgling swordmaster made such thorough sport of.”

The accent was faint, but grew distinct the more the other woman spoke. Uthukile, Angharad decided. Imani Langa was from the Low Isle and being raised speaking the Matabe dialect had left her with an accent in the Umoya they now spoke.

“I was blessed with a thorough education,” Angharad simply replied, then paused. “Would be I be wrong in believing you of the Low Isle?”

“Sharp of you. Only on my father’s side, as it happens, though I was raised in a hold near the border,” Captain Imani said. “I must compliment you on the lightness of your own accent, though those pretty silver lines on your arm rather reveal your own provenance.”

Only Pereduri could become mirror-dancers, though in truth Angharad did not know if this was ancient law or merely custom.

“Uthukile and Peredur felt like different ends of the world, once, but now the distance feels almost petty,” Angharad mused.

“No matter how far, we islanders will bring our bickering with us,” Captain Imani drily replied. “Why, only yesterday-”

She had a most mysterious smile, Angharad thought, but she was prevented from further pondering it when a servant apologized for interrupting them and presented her with a folded letter.

“From your Sacromontan friend,” the servant said. “Apologies again, ladies.”

“It is nothing,” Captain Imani dismissed.

Angharad unfolded the paper, finding an ungainly scrawl in Antigua waiting for her.

Imani had eye on you since you talked with hosts. Careful. Ferranda is liked, good ally. Avoid Forty-Ninth, enemies. Am following lead, don’t know when back.

Hiding her surprise, Angharad folded the paper anew and tucked it away as she replied in kind to Imani’s smile. Some details she filed away – Ferranda’s popularity and that the Forty-Ninth would have to be disposed of – for these could be addressed later. The first detail was the most concerning. There were many reasons she might have drawn Imani Langa’s eye earlier, and whilesome of them rather flattering others were rather more dangerous.

After a little more conversation the other woman suggested they go for a walk in the garden ring, Angharad’s stomach tightening in dismay as the balance settled in favor of sinister.

She could not even enjoy walking arm in arm in a field of flowers, bodies brushing together, for she had to be wary of contract and poison. With an inviting smile Imani led her past a crumbling wall, out of sight, but Angharad knew this would not end in soft kisses and wandering hands. She kept her body from tensing, for it would give away that she knew the attempt was coming, but was wondering how to explain having fought twice in one evening when the other woman’s hand rose towards the neckline of her bare skin of her tunic, fingers reaching for something-

“Daughter of the Isles, you are called to service,” Captain Imani said.

And from the generous cut of her uniform she produced not a knife but a small copper coin, pressing it into Angharad’s hand. No, not copper. It was wood, only polished and lacquered. On one side was carved a helmet-turtle’s shell, on the other a slender crown. Angharad knew of only one wood that kept so vivid a color without needing to be painted: this was Malani ironwood. Too precious a thing to be wasted on a token, unless you were in the service of Malan itself. Angharad swallowed drily.

“You are an ufudu,” she breathed out, and immediately felt like sinking into a hole.

It was one thing to call an agent of the Lefthand House a ‘turtle’ behind their back, the jokes about their emblem well worn in every corner of the Isles, but the High Queen’s private hunting hounds were not for the likes of her to disrespect. Even the highest of the izinduna feared their knives and knack for digging up the most deeply buried of secrets. Lady Imani, thankfully, did not seem offended by the foolishness Angharad had blurted out.

“I am a finger of the left hand,” Imani acknowledged. “The House has tasked me with passing to you a message, and with it an offer.”

Angharad’s jaw clenched. What was it that the same court that had struck House Tredegar from its rolls now had to say to her?

“Her Perpetual Majesty did not condone the killing of Lady Anwar Maraire, whom she yet remembers fondly,” Lady Imani said. “Circumstance forced the disgrace of House Tredegar, but those whose hand was at work on that night are even now being hunted.”

Angharad stilled. She could not have said whether she was starkly, deeply relieved or the most furious she had ever been in her life.

“A prisoner was taken at Llanw Hall,” Lady Imani said. “We know their name. The soldiers who slew your house are known to us as well. Hired men.”

“What,” Angharad slowly said, forcing her tone not to waver, “do you want?”

“There is an object on Tolomontera that is the rightful property of the High Queen,” the dark-eyed beauty said. “The Lefthand House asks that you retrieve it on our behalf and deliver it to my hands.”

The Pereduri’s eyes narrowed.

“You are on Tolomontera as well,” Angharad said. “Why would you need me?”

“Because,” Lady Imani amiably smiled, “I am not a mirror-dancer whose Watch connections make above suspicion.”

Meaning it was hidden somewhere dangerous and the Watch would be on the lookout for movement around it. A fool’s bargain by any fair measure. And yet a survivor. A cousin, she wondered, a servant? Sleeping God, just knowing she was not the last… All that and a trail she would be able to follow when she returned to Malan. The Lefthand House was playing her, and only a fool would let them.

Was Angharad a fool?

“Think on it,” Lady Imani said. “And when you decide, come find me.”

“Where?” she croaked out.

“The Emerald Vaults, room seventeen,” Imani said.

The dark-eyed beauty stepped away, yet smiling.

“I will be expecting you.”

Am I a fool? Angharad wondered, watching the other woman walk away. And she dreaded the answer not because she did not know, but because deep down she already did.

She was, and it was no choice at all.

# Chapter 6

“To join the court of cats,” Tristan hummed, “is most easily done.”

There were exactly forty-two people down in the Old Playhouse, barring himself and Tredegar. Of these ten were servants, which he suspected would not count as people according to many of those folk in fine black cloaks chatting beneath pavilions. The guests he’d get back to later, because it was worth picking out the strong and the weak, but Tristan could already tell the servants were a thread worth pulling at.

None of them wore livery, so they weren’t in the service of nobles. Neither did they wear black, so they shouldn’t be Watch – unless they were currently not on shift and looking to make a few silvers on the side by playing servant to students. Most blackcloaks would balk, he figured, pride offended by taking orders from wealthy children, but in a garrison of the size needed to hold Port Allazei there ought to be at least twenty willing to take that in the teeth for the money.

Only it couldn’t be that, because playing servant was one thing but cooking was another. That food, those drinks, they had to come from somewhere. Soldiers with a side racket wouldn’t be able to deliver an evening like this even if they organized. And they wouldn’t have had long to organize anyway, because why would they even try to before students arrived and the opportunity came up? Scholomance had been closed for centuries.

The thief followed those neatly dressed men and women with his eyes, leaning in the shade of a tree cast in Orrery light. Down below Tredegar circled around the last ring and traded greetings with guests. Tristan picked a wild rose and pulled at the petals one by one, Fortuna amusing herself by alternating ‘hates you’ and ‘loves you not’. Tristan couldn’t see someone leading the servants yet, but he could already tell this was no ramshackle outfit.

A blonde woman behind the pavilion was counting bottles as they left the crates, keeping a tally and giving instructions about how full the cups going out should be. The two slender Aztlan men by the food – same nose and eyes, brothers? – were not only cutting and passing the pigeon pies and pastries but keeping an eye on whether or not the grilled cutlets were still warm. It was not their first time hosting a party like this.

So what in the Manes were trained servants without an obvious master doing on Tolomontera?

“Hate you,” Fortuna happily called out as he pulled the last petal.

She brushed off her spotless dress, only now beginning to pay attention to her surroundings.

“Your Pereduri’s been noticed by the hosts,” she noted. “And why are we hiding up here, anyway? You should be down there dazzling people with my wit.”

Tristan’s gaze left the small Someshwari servant taking away the cloak one of the guests – a dark-haired woman who had no sleeves on her overcoat, turning it into some sort of doublet, but wore a wine-red undershirt with cowl sleeves that was so long it emerged past the belted as a sort of skirt. Watch fashion was only marginally more respectable than the noble kind.

“So I can see who has been waiting for Tredegar to arrive,” he said.

He parsed through the crowd, looking for the right kind of attention. Not passing curiosity or flicked glances but, in a word, recognition. Someone down there was waiting for Angharad Tredegar, and no matter how good you were you still needed to look to know someone was there. So Tristan looked for them in turn, sifting through the guests as Angharad Tredegar began to speak with their hosts.

Bored, he counted. That smirking pair? Making fun of her clothes. One was promising, he – ah, no, it was Tredegar’s ass and legs the man kept looking at. Sex and thus. But that Someshwari man with the contrasting brass spectacles and bulging arms who was discreetly writing into a notebook, now there was a suspect. He was looking as much at the hosts as Tredegar, but it was worth investigating. A second sweep gave him no one else, sadly, although – huh, how long had that Malani been eating the same prawn?

The one with the belt of colored beads and the golden bangles around her arms. There were three large Cathayan prawns in the bronze vessel she had been handed and only one was eaten, the others forever being nibbled on at an angle that just so happened to let her study Tredegar discreetly. And after a heartbeat the Malani flicked a look his way – surprised, he only barely ducked behind the tree in time.

“Contract,” Fortuna said, confirming his first thought. “And with a prickly bastard, too. He’s looking for me.”

“Can he find you?” Tristan whispered back in alarm.

“As if,” she snorted. “There’s so many gods in here it would be like picking a nipple out from a pile of tits.”

Though he had once spent two months working at a brothel Tristan Abrascal had never seen a ‘pile of tits’ and counted himself lucky in that regard. Sounded ghastly. Yet knowing that to react would only encourage the goddess, he ignored the words beyond the useful information conveyed.

“Is she still looking?” he asked.

Fortuna hummed, picking at her sleeve.

“No, but I think she’s keeping an eye on the stairs,” she replied.

So the Malani was still trying to learn who had been looking at her. Spy, Tristan decided. Or at least someone with training in the craft. It might be he had found his first fellow Krypteia student.

“It is a good thing I never intended to use them, then,” Tristan said.

The lodges didn’t fill the entire ring on every tier, more along the lines of two thirds – as was only sensible, if this had truly been a playhouse once. No one wanted to watch a play from seats situated behind the actors. Tristan doubled back to the other end of the ring he was on, keeping away from torchlight and carefully avoiding ever looking in the contractor’s direction, until he had reached the edge just by the stairs leading above.

There he had to sneak behind the pavilion where the man with the guest book still waited, but the Lierganen looked abjectly bored and half asleep. A wall had prevented passage, once, but it had long ago crumbled and as Tristan peered over the edge he found that below was a nook of bushes and grass but also something more: three wooden outhouses. There were green lanterns by them, perhaps to mark their location.

The thief checked to see if anyone was around, and when not took the opportunity offered. He lowered himself atop the roof of the leftmost outhouse, then leaped down into a bush with only muffled sounds. It turned out to be thornier than anticipated, but the Watch cloak and coat were mercifully thick and the cloth was hard to tear. Good quality, that, Tristan mused as he rolled out and began brushing off twigs and leaves. Tugging his collar back into place, he casually walked out and took in the layout.

The party had a simple enough layout: stage, food tables, drink tables and a surfeit of chatting princelings. Nothing arduous to navigate, the trick would be positioning himself so he could keep an eye on Tredegar and the marks in play without being too obvious about it.  Tristan began eyeing the food tables speculatively, wondering if there might be time for pigeon pie or one of those – huh, were those cutlets beef? They certainly smelled like it.

That couldn’t be right, though.

“Sleeping God, I cannot have had that much wine.”

The thief’s gaze was ripped away from the cutlets and onto the source of a familiar voice. Zenzele Duma looked much healthier than the last time Tristan had seen him, the eye he had lost in Cantica now replaced by a false one the same color as Tupoc Xical’s. Nice. Malani did have a knack for being theatrically vengeful. The lordling wore the formal uniform, fitted to him and with some golden locks of rope thrown in around the shoulders.

Sergeant Andres hadn’t offered those, so there must be other cloth shops in the port. Another mark for the servants here not being watchmen.

“Tristan,” Zenzele Duma said. “Is that you?”

“Zenzele,” the thief said, then gestured for him to get closer.

Looking worried, the Malani leaned in.

“I don’t suppose,” Tristan asked, “that you would happen to know where those grilled cutlets are from?”

“I,” Zenzele began, taken aback, then paused. “No?”

“Unfortunate,” the thief muttered, then cocked an eyebrow. “Not even if you, you know…”

He gestured vaguely, implying contract without mentioning anything of the sort.

“I am not sure there is anyone in all of Vesper that feels strongly enough about grilled cutlets for that to work,” the lordling replied.

He was, Tristan saw, fighting back a smile. Which was fair but also missing the point. Those cutlets were beef, not pork. Pigs and chickens you could raise in a ruin like Port Allazei – practically speaking the Murk was a ruin and both were common there – but cows needed grazing lands and those cutlets smelled fresh. The meat could be imported, of course, but how costly would that be on an island closed to trade ships?

No, most likely another part of Tolomontera was inhabited. Somewhere with decent land for cattle that must also be easily defensible, because there were bound to be some pretty nasty lemures on the island and the Watch wouldn’t bleed their own garrison for fresh milk and meat. They could have gotten both from goats without half this trouble. If it’s the Watch behind this at all. Was there a colony somewhere out there, another Cantica? Hopefully with fewer slaves and devils this time.

He would have to look into it. Until then, best distract Zenzele.

“I thought Malani were all about cattle,” Tristan said. “Isn’t the name of your coinage derived from-”

“The words sound similar, but they do not have the same root,” Zenzele flatly replied. “You are, evidently, attempting to distract me.”

Still inconveniently perceptive, then. That hadn’t stopped being a pain. A pause, then the Malani came closer and even lowered his voice.

“Were you even invited?” the nobleman asked in a whisper.

Not worried or irritated, that face, but scandalously eager. The thief did not mind throwing him a bone.

“The world is an invitation, Zenzele,” Tristan airily replied. “Though if you’ll excuse me, I need to take care of something.”

If he was going to be skulking the rest of the evening and leaving early, he best help himself to a meal first. Zenzele’s lips were twitching as he casually waved the man goodbye, getting a nod back. Keeping to the edge of the crowd, avoiding anything more elaborate than nods and smiles, Tristan sought out with his eyes both the Someshwari wearing spectacles and the Malani with the bead belt.

The former was by a small garden table, fumbling his attempts to fake eating a croquetas while trying to discreetly write in his little notebook. He was still watching Tredegar, but the sight of him accidentally dropping the same croqueta on a page for the second time had the Sacromontan somewhat reconsidering how much of a threat he might be.

That notebook better not be full of dreamy drawings of Angharad, or Tristan was going to have to break his legs – for wasting his time, if nothing else.

As for the Malani, it took longer to find her. She was, the thief found, positioned much as he was: on the edge and looking in. He forced himself to look right past her when he found her, lest her contract be drawn his way again, and then helped himself to the nearest plated food to justify standing where he was. It was a bronze vessel with three peeled Cathayan prawns – each long and thick as a finger – marinated in reddish sauce.

She’d chosen such a good spot to stand in earlier he had moved in the same without realizing. She was definitely suspicious. Tristan took a tentative bite of the prawn and found the taste strangely sugary. Until the spices hit, a heartbeat later, and then his mouth was aflame. Gods, it was even spicier than Old Town chorizo. It was like eating a torch only it didn’t have the decency to go out. He put the prawn back and discreetly coughed into his fist.

Fortuna, seeing the expression on his face, began cackling.

“You look like they’re making you swallow hot coals,” she said. “Start moving around a little and it could pass as a fresh form of dance. One, two, three, four, to the left and-”

“A cup of water, sir?”

He’d not even noticed the man approaching with a tray of cups, distracted by both an intangible hyena and the very fires of Hell he had foolishly allowed entry into his mouth. Lierganen, he immediately thought, early thirties. Curly brown hair and blue eyes, fit but not muscled and the callouses of work but not killing work. The thief put on a smile, coughing again.

“Please,” he got out.

He took the offered cup, slowly drinking. Merciful relief.

“You may well have saved my life,” he seriously said.

“All in a day’s work,” the other man replied.

Taking a second look now that he was no longer dying, Tristan saw what he missed on the first pass. Rings around the stranger’s eyes, only half-hidden by powdery cosmetics, and the edge of a tattoo under the man’s left sleeve. Tristan could not make out the whole of it but could hazard a guess from what he saw. Green ink, a rearing horse and a rider holding what should be a sword – Old Saraya’s arms, which was a common tattoo on their sailors.

The man did not look like a sailor, but it might just be common practice in that region and the thief had simply only ever met Sarayan that were sailors. Either way, the conversation was as good a hook to get into it with one of the servants as he was likely to get. Sympathy, he decided, would serve best as the opening line.

“You look like someone whose shift has been going on for six hours too long,” Tristan noted.

The man snorted.

“Try ten,” he said, then cocked an eyebrow. “Sacromonte?”

Tristan knew that accent, the way it softened z into s, and it confirmed the tattoo’s hint.

“Born and raised,” the thief said. “If I don’t miss my mark, you’re Sarayan.”

“From the Queen of Cities herself,” he proudly said.

Not that anyone but the inhabitants of Old Saraya still called their capital that. When the Grand Canal broke back in the Century of Crowns, the city built at one end of it had withered on the vine. Nowadays the Malani had seized the lands on the other end and sometimes made noise about clearing the waterway, but with Sacromonte willing to make war over the matter nothing ever came of it. The Six had spent centuries bullying their Sarayan rivals into irrelevance, they would not tolerate a resurgence.

“You’re a long way from home,” Tristan said, draining the rest of the cup.

The Sarayan asked for it silently and set it on the edge of his drinks tray.

“Not as far as you,” the man snorted. “Though I take your meaning; this is a little further out than the Islas Reales.”

Ah, Sarayans. Centuries since their island empire had turned to dust and still they called the island chains closest to their shore the Royal Isles. Old Saraya was no longer even a kingdom, but to hear them talk you’d think they were the Second Empire come again.

“It has been a strange few years,” the man admitted, then offered his hand to clasp. “Arnau.”

“Ferrando,” Tristan replied without batting an eye, shaking it.

It was simply the first name that had come to mind, but now that it was out… It’d be foolish, but the notion was simply too sweet to resist.

“Ferrando Villazar,” the thief winning smiled.

If Ferranda came at him with that rapier of hers he would just have to trade information for mercy.

“Well met,” Arnau replied, then rubbed the bridge of his nose with a groan.

“Should I leave you to rest?” Tristan asked.

Using the tired for information was always a coin toss and he was not yet so pressed for time he must forge on here.

“Please don’t,” the man said. “As long as I’m talking with a guest they’ll not get on my case for not making the rounds.”

“Rough boss?” he casually asked.

“She’s been working us to the bone,” Arnau grunted. “Thinks a success tonight means all those little Watch pricks are going to keep hiring us through the year.”

So definitely not a watchman himself, Tristan noted. As he’d thought, the servants were not blackcloaks. And they seemed to be running their own enterprise. Did the Watch allow others property rights on their island? Odd.

“No offense meant,” the Sarayan hurried to add. “You just don’t seem like…”

“I was brought along by exactly such a little Watch prick, don’t you worry,” Tristan grinned, then let the amusement bleed away and sighed. “You’re not the only one working. I’m supposed to find out a pair of names, but I honestly have no idea how.”

A lie, but servants always knew more than they showed. If Arnau could let him get answers without having his face known, Tristan would prefer that route.

“Try me,” Arnau said. “Which two?”

Ah, a bite. Tristan’s hand left the cover of his cloak, discreetly indicating the Someshwari with the wiry spectacles.

“No idea,” the Sarayan admitted. “The second?”

He now pointed the Malani with the colored beads belt and the golden bangles.

“Captain Imani Langa,” Arnau immediately said. “Eleventh Brigade.”

“That was quick,” Tristan said, not hiding his surprise.

“She’s captain to one of the money bags that hired us,” the man explained. “She’s come around once or twice and Jinjing told us to treat her like a queen.”

Jinjing being, Tristan guessed, their leader. The one putting the screws to her crew. Why such a thirst for coin, he wondered? It could be simple greed, but Tolomontera was surely not any thinking woman’s idea of a place to strike it rich. Perhaps there was some kind of bargain with the Watch, a rent or a cut.

“That makes one,” the thief happily said. “Many thanks, Arnau.”

“It is all in the Circle,” the man dismissed. “Besides, nostros y-”

“-el resto,” Tristan finished.

Us and the rest. Emperor Viterico’s famous answer to the Aztlan queen that had called him a madman for making war on her over the dead of a single handmaid. She was Lierganen, Viterico had replied. There is us, and there is the rest. The lowest of Liergan stood above even the kings across the water. It had been the boast of empire once, the Second Empire’s destiny of conquest manifest. But after the empire’s collapse, when entire provinces were swallowed by the dark and once-conquered kingdoms broke away and began gobbling up territories, the meaning shifted.

Us and the rest, men still said, but now it was in solidarity. The last children of Liergan, beggared inheritors of the great empire that had united Vesper, and though they were a mightily squabbling tribe they shared root and blood. Cousins over foreigners, that was what the words meant nowadays. Tristan saw the pull of that dream, of its shared inheritance, but he had been taught better.

Men will do all manners of foolish things for an empire, even a dead one, Abuela had laughed. Where was that brotherly love when Sacromonte sought to rule the waves, when Saraya tried to unite the Chelae or the Duquesas burned every port that did not fly their banner? The mighty nail that dream to their banners and wave it still because they know men will cut off their own hand for it and call it patriotism.

So no, Tristan had not bought into the lie. But he was not above using it, not in the slightest, or encouraging it. He slipped a pair of coppers against Arnau’s palm under the tray. He did not even pretend to refuse them before spiriting them away.

“You shouldn’t have,” the servant half-heartedly said, as if by rote.

“It’s all in the Circle,” Tristan echoed with a shrug.

Arnau hesitated.

“If you’re spending someone else’s coin,” he said. “There might be a way to get that other name.”

The thief leaned in, careful not to look too eager.

“Estevan out in front, the man with the guest book,” the Sarayan said. “He’s charged with remembering all the names and the faces. He’ll hold out for silver, though. Used to be a lord’s man, has ideas.”

Tristan did not, unfortunately, have silvers to spend. He was even running low on coppers – only five left, the cook had mostly paid for the sergeant’s boots getting ripped in mutton jerky – but it should be worth a look regardless. He thanked Arnau, discreetly disposed of the Lightbringer’s own prawns and considered how he might best go about approaching this Estevan.

“This is an evening for honorable company, Zenzele Duma,” a voice called out. “By what right do you attend?”

Some Malani noble was having a tantrum, which Tristan would have been entirely indifferent to if it did not involve an acquaintance. Which it did, unless there was another Zenzele in attendance. As the Malani lordling was not an ally Tristan would have been only marginally concerned by the situation, but of course it could not be that easy. Standing by Zenzele and Ferranda – so she’d made it after all, good on her – was Angharad Tredegar.

His fellow cabalist looked faintly disapproving, which on her was a look that could mean anything from someone speaking out of turn to an imminent duel to the death. Fuck, should he get involved?

No, that was looking at it wrong. Tredegar wasn’t out of her depth here, she was in her exact depths. What had she been trained for, if not honor games and ritualized stabbing? He didn’t even have to worry about her going too far if she got into a fight, the Pereduri would keep to the precise letter of her word. She was a shark in her native waters, right now, while he’d be a rat on a plank while trying to instruct her on how to swim.

This was not a problem, it was an opportunity.

Zenzele and the whiny noble got into it publicly, which drew everyone’s eye. The guests settled in for the show, a few of them moving to the first ring so they could look down at this as if it were a play put on for them, and that was a fine cover for heading up. Tristan went up with a pair excitedly chatting, slipped into the garden and doubled back towards the small pavilion where Estevan would be waiting with the guest book.

Only it turned out he was not the only one that notion had occurred to.

A tall Tianxi was speaking in irritated tones to the greeter, an interesting enough sight Tristan crept close and slipped into a bush to be able to listen in.

“Three arboles?” the Tianxi was saying. “That is absurd. I am asking for a name, not the key to your sister’s bedroom.”

“I was willing to be bargained down to two,” Estevan coldly replied, “but for that comment it will be full price. Pay or leave, I will debate no further.”

The Tianxi, who was tall and broad-shouldered but not all that muscled – not a fighter, perhaps? – looked furious and tried to argue but the servant was unmoved. Cursing all the while, the Tianxi paid and Tristan leaned in curiously to hear what had been worth that price.

“Her guest is called Tristan Abrascal,” Estevan said. “Gray eyes, dark brown hair, around five feet nine. Skinny but not sickly. Wearing the fighting fit, he has on him a knife on and something else strapped to his leg.”

The thief went still in the bushes, watching a glint of triumph come to the Tianxi’s eyes. It had been for him the other man was looking. Well, it seemed like he had found the first brigade out to abduct him. More worryingly, it also looked like they had just found him.

The thief stayed in the bushes until the Tianxi was gone, the servant sneering at his back and muttering something no doubt unkind, as he considered his options. Tristan’s neck was on the menu now, but that’d always been going to happen. It was simply unpleasant timing. In the distance, down below, there was shouting and something that sounded like Tredegar’s voice.

Ah, she was definitely going to cripple the sneering Malani then. Tristan was going to have to learn his name and brigade in case this came back to haunt them. Still, as Tredegar was being so enterprising about stepping into danger he should honor the spirit of their company and do the same. Rolling out of the bushes under the greeter’s bewildered gaze, Tristan rose to his feet and brushed leaves of his cloak as he offered the man a hard smile. 

“Good evening, Estevan,” he said. “I have some questions for you.”

The neatly dressed man froze for a second when he realized he had just been caught selling information about someone by that very same individual. His face immediately closed down, and he straightened his back.

“Master Abrascal,” he said. “What can I help you with?”

“Oh, Estevan, all sorts of things,” Tristan happily said. “And you’ll do it, too, or I’ll be walking straight to the nearest Watch officer to tell them you’re a participant in the attempted abduction of a blackcloak.”

His face did not so much as twitch, but his eyes dilated.

“Doubtful,” he said, sounding confident. “The man I did business with-”

“Is Watch,” Tristan said. “He’ll get a reprimand, and that’s it. But he’s wearing black, my friend. I cannot help but notice you’re not. How do you think that will go for you?”

To his honor, the other man showed no hint of fear in the face of what was a very real threat. But he was afraid, Tristan decided, and his next words betrayed as much.

“What do you want, Abrascal?” he bit out.

“Two names,” he said, “and the matching brigades.”

Estevan said nothing, but irritatedly gestured as if to tell Tristan to get on with it.

“The Tianxi who asked you about me,” the thief said.

“Captain Tengfei Pan, Forty-Ninth Brigade,” Estevan flatly said.

The thief filed that away. Forty-Ninth, was it? He must be a latecomer.

“A Someshwari with brass wire spectacles and big arms,” Tristan said.

Estevan did not answer, only watching him expectantly.

“I’m waiting,” the thief reminded him.

“And you will keep waiting,” Estevan said, “until you pay me two arboles. A name for a name, Abrascal. Anything more costs you.”

Tristan hummed. He could have repeated the threat, but there was a chance the man would call him on it and in truth he did not have to want to leave here just to follow through. Fortunately, Estevan had given him a second lever without realizing it.

“I’m a generous man, my friend,” the thief smiled. “I will even pay you three.”

Rightfully wary, Estevan frowned.

“Pay upfront,” he demanded.

“I already have,” Tristan said. “I am giving you three arboles by not informing Jinjing that you are taking bribes on the side. Somehow I’m guessing you’re not cutting her in on those, are you?”

By the sour look on Estevan’s face, he was not. The man spat to the side, into the same bush Tristan had rolled out of. Fair. He was getting robbed out of a decent bribe.

“Adarsh Hebbar,” the greeter said. “He’s not in a brigade yet.”

“Come now,” Tristan said. “Such a thin report for three arboles? That would be most unfair of you, Estevan.”

Estevan looked like he wanted to punch him in the throat, but the thief only smiled. He had little care for the anger of a man who had sold him out and then tried to shake him down.

“He’s Varavedan,” the greeter bit out. “Unarmed. And he’s a guest, not invited. Came in with Lady Cressida of the Nineteenth.”

The Nineteenth Brigade, was it? Another potential foe to investigate. Tristan was almost beginning to sympathize with Song: they were accumulating enemies at an impressive rate. The fact that this Adarsh was Varavedan was worth noting, but ultimately of no use to him. Varaveda was one of the most powerful realms within the Imperial Someshwar, but it was also landlocked. Tristan had never met any and knew little of their ways.

The thief could have pushed Estevan further for details on this Cressida, but it would not be worth the time and trouble. Best end this now and return to more important matters, so Tristan found the other man’s eyes and smiled.

“Our accounts are settled,” he said. “Let us part ways here.”

The man glared angrily.

“You think I’ll forget this, Abrascal?”

“Try to,” Tristan honestly advised.

“You-”

“It would inconvenience me,” he said, “to have to spend an afternoon on killing you without leaving a trail. But you must understand, Estevan, that is all it would be to me.”

He stepped closer, into the dark-haired man’s face, and the servant stepped back.

“An inconvenience,” Tristan softly said.

He smiled again and the man flinched.

“Do we understand each other, my friend?”

Estevan swallowed, all the more loudly for the silence between them. There was laughter in the distance, something amusing the crowd, but the thief did not look away. The other man nodded, hands shaking.

“A good evening to you, then,” Tristan said, and left him.

He had a duel to watch, though he suspected it might not last all that long.

—

A butter knife.

Tristan was not sure he would have been able to cut cold butter with one of these, much less a Malani swordmaster. Even one with only three stripes to Angharad’s ten. Mind you, the thief would not have bet on himself against a fledgling Malani swordmaster with three limbs if it came to a swordfight. Given how excited the guests became after the humiliating victory and this Lord Musa Shange – Ninth Brigade, that one, which he gathered was going to be a problem since their captain was a well-connected prick with a reputation for being vindictive – it was not all that hard to get a few of them talking.

The difficulty was to do it without getting seen by the captain of the Forty-Ninth, who was roaming about and having curt conversations with others while his eyes wandered, all the while Tristan himself kept an eye on this Adarsh Hebbar. The trick was to let himself be seen above in the gardens or near one of the nooks, then go around and while the Tianxi furiously search take the time to help himself to a plate and some conversation

No great secrets were revealed, though as he tore through a few cutlets – delicious – he was surprised to see the number of people who were glad for Lady Ferranda.Or rather Captain Ferranda Villazur, she was now called, of the Thirty-First Brigade. Ferranda was friendly with many other cabals by dint of having suggested that every two weeks a sort of conclave should be held between captains willing to share information on the perils of Port Allazei.

It was only sparsely attended, Tristan read between the lines, and he doubted any secrets of worth were being traded. But it had allowed a few of those in attendance to avoid wandering into dangerous parts of the city by accident and for that she had won gratitude. Lemures and lares were apparently quite common if you ventured far enough from the inhabited part of the city, Tristan learned, save on a road to Scholomance that the Watch kept clear by regular patrols.

The thief kept using the name of Ferrando, knowing that Captain Tengfei would be looking for him under another, though he refrained from using the false surname. Too likely to get him caught, however amusing it might be for a while.

That effort and staying out of sight paid off, Captain Tengfei eventually losing patience and wandering up into the ring gardens without his first arranging a sighting. After some minutes passed the man did not come back, which was no sure thing but allowed Tristan time for further boldness. Time to move on Adarsh, then, before he too decided to leave. The Varavedan kept scribbling in his notebook by the garden table, eyes still on Angharad and her fresh escorts.

Ferranda and Zenzele had evidently decided they were in her debt for the earlier public execution of Musa Shange’s reputation. A butter knife, gods. He wouldn’t have believed it if not for his own eyes. If he ever had to kill her he’d need a better plan than poison, that hadn’t worked out too well for Brun and Yaretzi.

Tristan also needed Adarsh’s notebook, so a distraction was in order. He cast a look around to find something of use, and to his mixed feeling it appeared as if Lucifer’s fiery vengeance might be. He took aside one of the servants wandering about and told him that Adarsh – who was discreetly pointed at – had been asking if there were any Cathayan prawns left. There were not on the table, but the woman assured him that there were some in the back.

Given the professionalism of the servants, within a minute a bronze vessel with the prawns was offered to the Varavedan – who looked surprised and asked a question, but when the servant looked around for Tristan she found the thief was gone. Hiding, in fact, behind a conversing pair a few feet away from them while feigning to be drunk and getting his bearings. Readying himself for the opening, Tristan watched Adarsh bite into a prawn and… not be set aflame.

Someshwari, right, fuck, the thief thought. They sold half the spices going around the Trebian Sea, the other half proverbially being crammed into everything they ate.

Only the man’s eyes widened with delight instead, and he positively devoured the prawns before calling for the same servant to come back. Having been exposed to Fortunat from a young age, Tristan was highly skilled at pretending utter coincidence had been a grand plan and he promptly stepped into the opening. While Adarsh addressed the servant, facing that way, Tristan discreetly passed behind him with his face angled so the servant would not be able to see it.

He swiped the booklet from the table and promptly disappeared into the crowd. He ducked out into the garden above, cracking open the pages once he was out of sight, and frowned down at what he saw. Only three pages were in use, each titled with a name. Ferranda Villazur on the first and third, Angharad Tredegar on the second. Beneath them were a mix of names, numbers and words in Samratrava that he could not decipher.

The numbers, though, were imperial. And they were telling: none above fifty, several repeating. Brigade numbers. The man was keeping track of who talked with Angharad and Ferranda, though he did not seem to have everyone’s names or brigades. Perhaps to fill in the blanks he might be using physical descriptions in his native tongue, explaining the Samratrava. Either way, this was concerning.

Adarsh Hebbar had clearly been sent to keep an eye on those two, and despite the utter lack of subtlety he had gathered quite a bit of information.

From up in the ring garden Tristan had a clear view of the Varavedan realizing his notebook was missing, but instead of anger or throwing a tantrum he was surprised to see Adarsh pale. The man looked around for it feverishly, and when he found nothing turned to the garden ring at a fast pace. He was not searching for a culprit, Tristan realized, but preparing to leave. That complicated things.

Hiding so Adarsh went past him, Tristan ripped a page from the notebook and found Arnau again. He asked to borrow charcoal to write a note for Angharad, keeping it brief-

Imani had eye on you since you talked with hosts. Careful. Ferranda is liked, good ally. Avoid Forty-Ninth, enemies. Am following lead, don’t know when back.

-and forked out another pair of coppers to make sure Arnau delivered it to Angharad unseen. The man was more than willing. Thanking him, Tristan hurried after the retreating Varavedan spy as quickly as he could without drawing attention. He kept his distance as Adarsh went all the way up to the rings, where he pulled up the hood on his cloak and walked into the night.

Well now.

Time to have a pleasant conversation with his new friend.

# Chapter 7

Adarsh Hebbar was quick on his feet and not half so careless as he looked.

He also was not heading back to Hostel Street, if the way he headed straight for the broken shrines behind the Old Playhouse was to be believed. Tristan had to wait and let him get ahead, as the stairs back down to the street were open ground with little room to hide, but he hurried after the Varavedan the moment line of sight was broken.

The shrines were more rubble than ruin, but there were enough spans of columns and roofs left he could move from cover to cover. Adarsh, constantly looking back to see if he was being followed – but never in the right places, always in the open instead of the corners – entered a row of collapsed houses in all haste. A blunder. Buildings were only good at shaking off pursuers when you knew all the ways in and out, a row of ruins with more wind than walls would not help him in the slightest.

Tristan cut in through a collapsed wall to catch up, then kept close as they ghosted through the ruin together. Close enough that when silver Orrery lights swept ahead he could see the nerves on the bespectacled man’s face, those thick brows knotted into a constant half-flinch. Did he know he was being followed? Tristan did not think he had been seen but a contract might not care for that.

This island was not going to be kind to him, he could already tell. Anyone here could have a contract, it made situations difficult to gauge properly.

Adarsh seemed to have some notion of where he was heading, leaving the ruined houses for a narrow alley leading up to a town square. A better choice than the houses, as the alley was so narrow it’d be near impossible to hide in. Which the Varavedan must have been counting on, as he stopped after reaching halfway in to wait and see if anyone followed.

Tristan immediately gave up that game as lost, instead circling around through a larger street to the left that was full of broken statues and quickening his step on the way to the town square. The place was not so large as it had seemed, for at its heart what must have once been a few trees around a large pillar was now a thick copse touched by rubble.

The trees were a decent place to place his ambush, Tristan decided, and he found a tall root overlooking the easiest path west. Hiding there, he waited and was eventually confronted with the sight of absolutely nothing. Adarsh was not coming. Had the man played him, baited him into circling around before running back towards the Old Playhouse? If so, the thief was reluctantly impressed.

He moved towards the head of that narrow alley, risking a glance in, and found a silhouette in there – thankfully looking the other way. Ah, Adarsh wasn’t gone; he was still trying to catch out his pursuer. If there was a contract at work here, it must not be a precise one. Taking this for the opportunity it was, Tristan moved the site of his ambush to a once-shop at the left side of the alley head.

There was a large window there, and by the looks of the marks in the stone beneath it there must have been a wooden counter wedged in. Long gone, that, but the window would serve to keep an eye on Adarsh’s movement and the shop door should lead Tristan straight behind him. The thief settled in to wait, but did not need to: mere heartbeats later he heard hurried steps in the alley.

The Varavedan did not come out, though. Instead he stopped on the left edge of the shop window, less than two feet from where Tristan was waiting. The thief had an almost direct look at Adarsh and went still as stone so movement would not draw his eye. The tanned man sagged against the wall, relief plain on his face. He took off his spectacles and pulled up the hem of his cloak, cleaning them with the cloth. 

Which was when Tristan reached through the window, snatching his collar and dragging him in through up to the shoulders. Before Adarsh could so much as scream he had a knife against his throat.

“This doesn’t have to get ugly,” Tristan said, tightening his grip. “You just need to answer my questions.”

He forced the Varavedan to bend at a bad angle the way Abuela had taught him – Adarsh had less than an inch on him, it was easy – not so much of a bend it would hurt but enough it’d be hard for the other man to get enough of a footing to fight him off. The Varavedan swallowed loudly.

“Bhosdike,” the man cursed. “I don’t know who you are, but this is a mis-”

“Your name is Adarsh Hebbar,” Tristan cut in. “You have been taking notes about who speaks with Ferranda Villazur and Angharad Tredegar. Why?”

The man slumped, as if the fight had just gotten beaten out of him.

“Bait,” he said, and for a moment the thief tensed before relaxing at what followed. “Just call me Bait, that’s my name now.”

The bitterness in his voice was the detail that let Tristan put it all together at last. The man being a terrible spy, the individuals he had been writing about and now the mocking name forced on him?

“You’re with Tupoc Xical,” the thief accused. “Fourth Brigade.”

“With is a strong word,” Bait replied. “Can I put my glasses on? I don’t want to drop them, they’re very expensive.”

“No,” Tristan refused. “It would make it harder to blind you.”

The man shivered.

“I told himno, you know,” the Someshwari whined. “I’m a Savant, we don’t reconnoiter. That’s for Masks and Militants.”

“And then he punched you,” Tristan said, trying hard not to be amused.

A valiant effort, but the cause was doomed.

“He doesn’t do it himself anymore,” Bait mournfully said. “It’s Expendable now, she’s next in the ladder.”

“Ask about the names,” Fortuna demanded, suddenly wedged against him and leaning past the windowsill to peer at their prisoner. “Tristan, don’t you dare not ask about the names.”

There were more important questions, the thief knew. Truly. Still.

“Explain the names,” he ordered.

“Xical says it’s to keep us motivated,” Bait sighed. “We fight every month and the one who does best gets to use their real name while the rest of us get one of the placeholders.”

Bait, Trista learned when prodding further, had placed second behind a Navigator called Alejandra. He stood above the inauspiciously named ‘Expendable’, who herself ranked above the even more unfortunate ‘Acceptable Losses’.  Apparently Tupoc had struck some kind of bargain with Lady Cressida from the Nineteenth to get Bait into the Old Playhouse, under instruction to pretend he was part of no brigade.

Entertaining as Xical’s general inability to refrain from being terrible was when turned on others, there was something off here. This wasn’t the Dominion, there should not be souls so desperate that Tupoc felt like a good idea.

“Why do you stick with him?” Tristan asked. “You cannot be forced to be part of a cabal.”

“You think I’d stick around if I had a choice?” Bait said. “It’s either him or sticking with the spares.”

“And your lack of alternatives springs from…”

Bait grimaced.

“My father was a colonel in the Twelve Hundred Sleepless Slayers,” he said. “Only he was, uh, caught embezzling from company funds and selling information on the side.”

A free company of the Watch, Tristan deduced, likely somewhere out in the Imperial Someshwar.

“And that makes you pariah how?” the thief asked.

“He was selling it to the Rana of Kuril so she could underbid on contracts,” Bait said. “The company didn’t look kindly on that – they hung and quartered him, then tossed my family out. I was already on my way to Scholomance when it happened so I thought they’d decided to spare me, but no. They sent word ahead to Tolomontera: there’s not a student here with family in the black that doesn’t know what my father did.”

Tristan almost winced. The Watch was as a tribe, tolerating quarrels within itself but fiercely punishing any conspiracy with outsiders. This had the sound of a thoroughly poisoned well.

“And a man who calls you Bait is better than trying a spare cabal?”

“Well,” Bait slowly said, “he is a Stripe.”

“I am aware of that particular miscarriage of a decision,” Tristan said, “but why would it matter to you?”

“Academians can get perks for their cabal as part of their covenant class,” the bespectacled man said. “Enough to get a real edge. I was warned that by the time the yearly test comes either you’re under a Stripe or you’re fodder.”

Perks for the cabal, was it? That sounded like someone running a game to Tristan. No doubt there’d be prices for the boons, drawbacks. It felt like a way for those officer candidates to tame their cabal, get the wild beasts used to looking up to the hand feeding them. Why the Stripes would want this was easy enough to figure out, but why had the other cabals agreed?

“Useful information,” Tristan noted. “My thanks.”

“And what do those help me? You took my notes, so I’m about to be the new Expendable,” Bait sighed. “Captain Tupoc is not forgiving of failure.”

The thief smiled, not that the other man could see it.

“Why, Bait, there is no need for such glumness,” Tristan said. “I can tell we are kindred souls, you and I.”

A pause.

“Yes,” Bait tried, though it sounded like a question.

“Naturally I will return your notes to you,” the thief said. “We are friends, aren’t we? I like to help my friends.”

Bait twisted around to glance at him as much as he could, which was not very much.

“Could you,” he hopefully said, “take your knife off my throat then, friend?”

“No,” Tristan said.

He paused.

“Bait, in the spirit of our long and sincere friendship I would ask of you the tiniest of favors.”

“Oh no,” the man groaned.

“That page where you noted who Angharad Tredegar was speaking with,” Tristan said. “You will carefully remove it and replace it with a list that makes no mention of Captain Imani Langa.”

The Varavedan frowned.

“Why?”

Because she was the most dangerous of them by far and he wanted Tupoc Xical nowhere near someone who was a genuine threat to the Thirteenth.

“We’re really not that sort of friends, Bait,” the thief chided, tapping the flat of his knife against the hollow of the man’s throat. “Try again.”

“Good as done,” Bait croaked out.

“That’s lovely to hear,” Tristan beamed. “I don’t think there’s any need for either of us to mention this conversation to Tupoc, is there?”

“Never,” the Varavedan fervently said.

“Your friendship is a great comfort in these trying times, Bait,” the thief said. “So much that I think in the coming days I might seek you out again so we can have comforting conversations.”

“Please do not make me a spy,” Bait desperately asked. “I am very bad at it.”

Tristan sighed, as if that had actually been his intention. Like Tupoc would not sniff out the man before the hour was done – by the nervous sweat alone, if nothing else. Bait almost looked like he’d been in the rain.

“All right,” he said. “But I might have some academic questions to ask a Savant, on occasion. I trust you can help me with that, at least?”

“It’d be my pleasure,” Bait hastened to reply.

Tristan strongly suspected that assertion would not survive being asked what a heresiarch was. Still, now that he had liberally used the stick he should offer up some honey.

“When we have these little talks,” Tristan said, “it would naturally be my role as your friend to share things with you. Rumors, secrets – perhaps I might even get information for you, if you are tasked with obtaining it by Tupoc.”

“That could be helpful,” Bait admitted, sounding pleased.

“It will be,” the thief replied.

That was how you kept people on the hook, by giving them things they wanted. It was even odds whether Tupoc would sniff out this arrangement or not, but even if he did there could be a use for that.

“I am about to let you go, Bait,” Tristan announced. “But before I do, I’m afraid there is one last spot of bad news: I’m going to need your cloak.”

The man blinked in confusion.

“Why?”

“It has a hood,” the thief informed him, “and you’re about the right height.”

—

With Bait cut loose and a new cloak stashed away, Tristan decided to call it a night. It would not do to linger too much out here. He had yet to see lemures or even lares, but it was only a matter of time.

It was simple to cut straight south in the direction of Hostel Street than double back to the Old Playhouse, so Tristan took to the streets under the Grand Orrery’s strange lights. The earlier silver had turned pale, almost like a lantern’s glow, but from the way the shadows were moving between walls the false star above must be heading east. No other slice of light seemed close, so the thief expected a span of dark sometime on the way back. That prospect kept him on his toes, enough that he noticed it.

The first time he saw movement on the rooftops could have been happenstance, but not the second.

Tristan was all for exploring this mazelike ruin of a city and would hardly begrudge a soul standing atop a collapsed dome for better view of the surroundings, but when someone flicked a glance down into an alley to see if you were there and then precipitously hid when you noticed things got a mite suspicious.

“Someone’s in trouuuuuuble,” Fortuna sing-sang.

“Check the roof,” he murmured, pressing himself against the wall.

The thief had taken the most direct path back to Hostel Street, past a long-dry canal and now through a knot of narrow alleys reminding him of the Murk, but it seemed that’d been a mistake. It’d been predictable, and predictable was always the worst pick when there were people out to grab you. He should have remembered that. Fortuna’s head popped out through the wall an inch away from his face, grinning.

Ugh. He would never get used to that.

“They jumped down, but I heard people talking in the street on the other side,” she told him. “At least three.”

Best to assume the worst and assume an entire cabal of seven were after him, then. It could be more than one brigade out there, admittedly, but Tristan was inclined to believe that given their advantage in odds they’d not be inclined to split the bounty on his head with another cabal. The gray-eyed man breathed out, brushed away the early stirrings of fear. If he was to be hunted, best it be among alleys. He knew his way around that kind of battlefield.

“Oh, I just realized,” Fortuna chortled. “Maze of streets. Rat. You’re like a-”

“Don’t you dare,” Tristan hissed.

“- rat in a maze!” she proudly finished.

He would have to ask Bait about the feasibility of trading in your god for another. Freshly irate, the thief got to work. First he best get off the street, lest he be herded into dead ends by superior numbers. He would have risked that against coterie thugs, but would not against Scholomance students. A glance to the side revealed there was a round window in the wall he’d been pressing against – which Fortuna had pointedly not used – and he climbed onto it.

A half-collapsed arch curved over the alley, just out of his reach, but he got around that by anchoring his foot on a slightly jutting jamb stone and throwing himself at the arch. His fingers scrabbled against the rough, worn bricks but with a grunt he dragged himself atop the arch. From there it was only a small climb to the flat roof from which he had just been spied on, now deserted save for the weeds growing on it. Thank the gods he’d not worn the formal uniform with those shiny, slippery boots. He’d be on the ground groaning right now if he had.

Tristan crept towards the opposite end of the roof, where Fortuna had said she heard voices, but when he risked a glance over the edge the alley was empty – not so the street just past the corner, where he caught sight of someone moving. Eyeing the roof on the other side of the alley, another of those flat brick surfaces cracked open by weeds, the thief decided to risk a leap. Given how cramped the alley was the risk came not from the leap itself but the landing: stone or not, there was no telling how solid that roof was.

Cloak trailing behind him, he landed atop the brick with a merciful lack of immediate collapse beneath his weight. Wasting no time he crept for the edge, now at a better angle to look at the people past the corner. There were three of them, he counted. One was the tall Tianxi from earlier, Captain Tengfei of the Forty-Ninth Brigade. So that was where he’d gone to after stalking off.

With Tengfei were two more: another Tianxi with a chubby face, shuffling nervously on his feet, and blonde Lierganen girl with a scar across the nose and a hard look about her. They were whispering, but loudly enough Tristan could mostly make out the words.

“-don’t see him,” the woman was saying. “Too many alleys to hide around here, we should have waited in the Mangles.”

“He would have fled right back to here,” Captain Tengfei grunted back. “We have him surrounded, Ramona. Muchen will sweep from behind and-”

Four, Tristan counted. Four of them confirmed. Tempted as he was to simply keep fleeing by rooftop, he first wanted to know if they had a way to track him. These Mangles – the name for the large field of broken, overgrown shrines between here and the Old Playhouse, he figured – sounded like a bad place for them to catch him. The captain and the Lierganen girl both had muskets and blades, the nervous one a pistol.

Any of those could end him in an instant if they found him out in the open.

A flicker of movement stirred him out of his study. Not down there but closer to home. Another rooftop, flanking the one he had first climbed from the other side – some was climbing over the edge, black-cloaked. Keeping calm, Tristan looked for cover. The edge of the roof was too low to hide him fully, but to his right a pack of weeds had grown tall enough he was able to flatten himself behind them. Unless the Orrery lights swept straight across him, he should be hard to make out.

He could not see much himself, in that position, but there was a way around that.

“That’s the same one that jumped down earlier,” Fortuna said. “She’s looking down into the same alley but from the other side.”

Tristan subtly nodded. A curse in Umoya sounded in the distance.

“He’s gone,” a woman called out.

“He can’t be, we fenced him in,” Captain Tengfei called back. “He’s just holed up in a house. Huang, confirm it.”

By the provenance of the voice, it ought to be the nervous Tianxi boy who answered.

“I don’t have much left for the night,” Huang said. “Are you sure you-”

“Do it,” Tengfei snarled.

A sigh, then a moment of silence.

“Not north,” Huang said, then waited another heartbeat. “Not west. Only four uses now.”

A contract that confirmed whether someone – something? – was in a direction or not, Tristan guessed. Or something along those lines. If he could get them to spend these last ‘uses’, waiting them out became an entirely viable way to get rid of them. They could no more afford to spend the night out here than he could.

“I’ll sweep the houses with Muchen,” Ramona said. “You two take the sides to prevent him slipping away.”

“I give the orders here, Ramona,” Captain Tengfei flatly replied. “We might both be Stripes, but only one commands.”

“Careful, Teng,” she warned. “You got us the bounty and that got you the seat. It doesn’t mean you have to stay in it.”

If this was what the competition was like Tristan was beginning to feel rather more confident in the Thirteenth Brigade, horrible number aside. He waited until he heard movement, the Forty-Ninth beginning the search, and then turned a questioning look on Fortuna.

“She’s still on the roof,” the Lady of Long Odds confirmed. “Back to you, though, she’s looking at the other alleys.”

No time to waste, then. Tristan rose smoothly from the cover of the weeds, one step to the side and then two step backs. The woman who’d cursed – Malani, he could see from the dark skin even in this gloom – had her back turned to him. She was studying the street he’d used to get to the alley she first found him in, looking intently at a collapsed house full of bushes. Tristan leaped across the alley to the next roof, muffling his steps the way Abuela had taught him, and as he advanced to the next slowly took out his blackjack.

Eight long, quiet strides as he angled himself right and then the thief leaped again, onto the roof where his enemy was. A heartbeat after making it across he waited, looking for a reaction, but she had not heard a thing. Instead the woman crouched down at the edge of the roof, squinting at a bush being made to move by the faint breeze. Tristan took his time approaching, careful not to make a sound, and then he struck.

The blackjack took her in the right temple, knocking her unconscious with a faint thump, and Tristan slid an arm around her waist to prevent her toppling over the edge. It was harder than he had thought – her cloak hid that she was plump of body – but he laid her down on the roof, smoothing his breath as he waited for a shout from the streets below. None came. He had not been noticed. Good, he could afford to search her then.

Rifling through her affairs got him seven silver arboles, a good knife, a loaded pistol of Watch make with ammunition for five shots and a set of matches whose use he only understood after discovering that there was something in the inner pocket of her cloak. A round, cast iron grenade. Could be useful, he decided, pocketing it along the rest save for the knife. That one he put to work, putting his blackjack away and turning the stranger on her back – carefully ensuring she could still breathe – and pulling back the cloak to expose her legs.

He took off her right boot, revealing a worn yellow stocking he took off as well. Tristan leaned in, taking her knife and sharply slicing across the back of her heel. Quick and deep, so he would fully cut through the tendon. She stirred, feeling the pain even when unconscious, but it was not enough to wake her. It was enough to ensure she would never walk with that leg again, however, it the tendon was not healed.

It was tempting to simply kill her so she would not trouble him again, but the risks were too high for the gain. Dropping her knife on her back, Tristan palmed her pistol and crept away. Putting a bullet in the back of the man with the contract should be enough to ensure he was able to flee, he thought, though he’d have to wait for an opening. Best to leave this particular rooftop first, he had already lingered here too long.

A stripe of golden Orrery light swept across the nest of alleys, cast by some distant star, and Tristan ducked down as he swallowed a curse. He’d be a lot easier to see so long as the light stayed, he might even already have – half a man’s body was already over the edge of the rooftop, and the thief would never have known if he’d not looked because not a sound had been made. He met dark eyes, the lithe Tianxi – not one of the earlier two, this one must be ‘Muchen’ – holding a naked straight blade between his teeth to keep his hands free.

Tristan, naturally, shot him.

He’d aimed for the right shoulder, barrel snapping back as the powder caught, but the shot dragged to the left. Center of mass, right in the chest, and the thief was already hoping it wouldn’t be outright lethal when there was a blur. A milk-white hand with a lotus on the palm formed in front of the Tianxi, turning into a shower of tinkling porcelain shards but catching the bullet. A heartbeat later the man was on the roof, sword in hand, and Tristan grimaced.

If that wasn’t a Skiritai student he’d eat his hat. Time to run, tracking contract or not. The likely-Muchen flicked a glance down at his unconscious comrade and frowned.

“I will have to cripple you for that,” he calmly said.

Tristan took a step back, narrowing his shoulders and putting fear on his face.

“Please don’t,” he pleaded, throwing the pistol at the man’s feet. “I surrender.”

Shouts below, the others of the cabal catching up, and Tristan took another step back as the Tianxi swordsman thinly smiled. He angled his torso so his cloak would pull in front of him, hiding his hands.

“A foot for a foot,” Muchen said. “It need not be painful.”

Fuck, this was hard to do blind and he wasn’t sure about the length.

“Would you take a bribe?” Tristan baldly asked, playing for time.

The Tianxi laughed.

“You’re worth enough we won’t have to dip into brigade funds at all this year,” Muchen replied. “You think coppers will stay my hand?”

A burn on his fingers told the thief it was now or never, face twisting in pain the Tianxi mistook for fear.

“Maybe not,” Tristan admitted.

But the stolen grenade he’d lit under his cloak might, so he threw it at the other man’s feet. Only the utterly ridiculous prick was already moving, the flat of his sword about to lob the grenade back his way, so Tristan borrowed luck.

The ticking began in the back of his mind.

It all happened so fast he could barely make it out. A spark flew off the end of the wick and caught the bottom, spreading the fire there, and even as Muchen began to lob the grenade it exploded. Not with powder but with noise and blinding light, like fireworks, and the Tianxi screamed in pain. Tristan released the luck, opening the eyes he’d closed and finding it was all dark. Had he been blinded? No, the pale light from above had simply stopped. Too strange a turn of luck, he thought, for that to be the whole. He’d used the draw to hurt someone, more or less and-

From beneath his boots the stone began to crack.

“Fuck,” Tristan feelingly said, and fell.

—

Falling through the roof was hard enough on his legs, but then the floor gave as well and it all went to shit.

Tristan rolled around with a groan, feeling out his limbs. He was glad to see nothing was broken, though his left leg hurt like Hell and his chest was going to be a mass of bruises – a couple of loose stones had fallen with him, thankfully none so large that his sternum broke. Pushing through the pain the thief forced himself to move, unsure whether or not the Skiritai had fallen down here with him.

It was dark in this presumed basement, and he could not see the firmament above. He felt a sliver of fear at the thought that the collapse might have sealed the house over his head, but it was too early to give in to panic. Reluctant as he was to burn air, he needed to see so he reached inside his pockets and produced the matches. Striking one, he took in as much of his surroundings as he could before it guttered out.

Loose stones and rubble everywhere around him, in a room no larger than a carriage, and no sign of Muchen. The good news, that. The bad ones were that above his head seemed to be a ceiling of solid stone. Which meant he’d not only fallen down but to the side as well – he’d not felt that, but directions were hard to make out when falling in the dark. Four matches left. He struck another to try and examine what direction he might have come from, finding only that to his left was thickly packed rubble and to the right solid stone.

Three matches left.

Cursing, Tristan began crawling around the two directions he had not yet explored. Ignoring the throbbing of his fresh collection of bruises the thief tried the wall behind and found it to be solid stone, though there was metal bolted in. Torch holders by the shape, gone rusty by the feel of the metal. A dead end. With only the front left he tried that wall and found more masonry. His stomach clenched.

Was he buried alive? No, he could still try to dig his way out through the rubble. It was risking a landslide in a room so small it would be impossible for him to move out of the way. But was there even another choice? He couldn’t just wait here, running out of – air? Against his knees, he’d not felt it because the coat and cloak were so thick. Fingers trembling, he felt his way down the masonry until he found a metal grid. Not hesitating, Tristan cracked a match.

Two left.

A rusty grate, barely in its hinges, blocked access to what looked like some kind of dry sewer tunnel, covering the entrance to a low and narrow tunnel. Large enough for him to squeeze through, if barely. When the match went out the thief evened out his breath, settled his mind. He did not have his tools on him, but that grate looked on its last legs. He wrapped his cloak around his fingers and pulled at it, grunting with effort until one of the hinges gave. He broke all those he could, and though one resisted his best efforts he was still able to pry open the grate.

Into the tunnel he went, crawling on his belly as he felt out in front of him with his fingers. There was dried filth at the bottom, so long there it felt more like dirt than anything else, and when Tristan found the first clump of weeds his excitement rose. Weeds didn’t come from nowhere, the wind carried seeds. He must be close to an exit. A few seconds later he came at a crossroads: left, right, front or back the way he’d come. Reluctantly, the thief cracked another match.

One left.

Only he saw near nothing for a faint gust of wind from ahead put out the flame before he could take in much. Tristan paused, awaiting Fortuna’s laughter even as relief poured in from having gotten the answer he needed anyway, but nothing came.

“Are you here?” he whispered.

A long silence.

“Red is the least fashionable color,” he tried.

Silence continued, the thickness of it clogging his throat, and Tristan force himself to swallow. Fortuna was not here, but why? He’d not pulled on the luck anywhere as strongly as he had on the Dominion. Was it something about Tolomontera, an old Antediluvian device that prevented her from coming to him? She will be back, he told himself. I just need to get on the streets again. Ignoring the cold sweat on his back, the thief began crawling forward again.

The dark ahead was so deep it was his only hand that told him of the drop.

Carefully he felt out in greater detail, finding more and more emptiness, then risked peeking out his head and looking around. Above was another grate, thick squares large enough to put a hand through, and though those he made out the faintest hints of light. A way back up, he thought with relief. Now the trouble was finding out how to get there. Further feeling out let him figure that he was at the edge of a tall drop, facing an identical tunnel across that gap.

The drop and the shaft going up to the grate both seemed wider than the tunnel he was in, but not so wide he would not be somewhat squeezed. He could leverage his way up there, then, if he was careful. Only if he slipped he had no real notion of how long the drop would be. It might well kill him. The rat reached for his knife.

“Rat King,” he murmured, praying up at the street. “Prince of scraps and scrabbling, gutters and grimed, smile on me this once. They are big and I am small, so help me scurry off.”

Tristan pulled down his sleeve and cut at his forearm, wiping the wet blade against the edge of the drop. He felt not warmth or weight, but then he never had: that was not how the Rat King did business. Besides, he was far from Sacromonte, much too far for the god to lend a hand. It had been as much to harden himself to the risk as to seek aid he’d done it, Tristan would admit as much to himself. Sheathing the knife, the rat got to work.

He wriggled out, wedging a foot on the edge of both tunnels, and from there began the climb. His body ached, bruises throbbing, but he bit his tongue and pushed on: feet on one wall, back on the other, pushing himself up slowly but surely. Sweating and aching, he made it inch by inch until he was in arm’s reach of the grate above. He reached out for it, cursing when he saw the iron grid could be pushed off but there was a large padlock preventing it.

The muscles of his back trembling, Tristan slipped a hand through the grate. The lights above were strangely dim so he could barely make out what he was doing, but he felt out the padlock carefully. A simple key lock, roughly made. Shoddy workmanship and the metal was something softer than iron. Copper, maybe? The opening for the key was wide and from what little his fingers could tell the inside of the lock was the same metal as the outside.

The pressure on his knees was mounting, the trembling of his getting worse as he got tired, but Tristan forced his breath to stay even. His palms were dry, his eyes open, and he reached for his knife. Slipping his armed hand through, he angled it as best he could and slid the tip knife into the padlock’s keyhole. It was large enough the blade went right in, but he couldn’t just shove it in and turn – it’d snap his knife, steel or not.

He felt out the insides with the blade, looking for the right angle, and gently began to wiggle it. Shoddy padlocks used simple teeth, rarely more than two plugs, so if he got the angle just right… One click, Tristan heard. Now he must find another, but the trembling of his legs shivered up and made his hand unsteady. Holding his breath not to miss the noise he began wiggling the blade again and – one, two. Tristan turned the blade.

Only for his boot to slip some, turning a gentle turn into a snapping sound. He almost screamed in frustration as he felt his knife’s blade break, biting his lip until it bled not to make a sound as he got his foot back in place. Putting away the remains of his blade, he reached for the padlock with his hand and – loose? Breathing in, the thief pulled at the shackle and it gave. Manes, he’d gotten it done just before the snap.

Off went the padlock, then he pushed the grid aside as quietly as he could and dragged himself up onto the street. Resting on his belly, every limb aching and drenched in sweat, Tristan pressed his face against cool stone and did not even care he was smudging his cheek with dirt.

He stayed there breathing in the dark for a long moment, eyes closed but ears pricked. He did not know what had happened to the Forty-Ninth, but he doubted the collapse of the house had been enough to kill all of them. If Muchen had died, would he be responsible by Scholomance’s rules? He was uncertain, but surely that they had been the ones to come after him would count for something. Breathing out, the thief, forced himself onto his knees as his cloak fell around him in curtains.

He glanced up at the lights, and that was when he realized he was in trouble: that wasn’t the Grand Orrery.

Or rather it was, but the false stars were nothing like the way he knew. They were without color, pale and veiled and casting only the faintest of glows onto Tolomontera. Like a lantern with a cloth atop it. Fingers clenching, Tristan looked around what he had thought to be a street but was nothing of the sort: he was on a flat roof, surrounded by what must be a hundred of the same, and from the angle of the horizon on the distance must be at least three stories high.

The city around him was Port Allazei, but it did not look the same. There were no Glare lanterns, only torches, and the buildings did not look as worn – or abandoned. People still lived here, and he thought he could hear the noises of a city asleep on the wind. Panic welled up, but Tristan mastered it. It could be he had gone through some kind of Gloam storm after falling into the house’s basement, but this might also be some sort of dream. Something not real.

The rough stone of the roof felt real under his hand, but it would if this were a dream. He had to believe that.

“First the edge of this… whatever this is,” Tristan muttered to himself. “Then we decide if it’s all worth screaming about.”

Fortuna’s silence only deepened the shadows of the night.

Moving across the rooftops was not difficult. The heights of the roofs were uneven, but they were also all roughly rectangles so there was always a path to climb if he went around. Like giants’ stairs, they were. The Orrery lights above were so dim he found it difficult to orient himself, but the lights down in the city served as the north to his compass. He must have begun near the middle, and but a few minutes into the straightforward but laborious process of moving across he was given pause.

There was a cottage.

Tristan had grasped the shape of what he was on, more or less. The overall layout must be that of a cube made up of stacked rectangles, small houses piled atop one another over several stories like some childish god had been at play. The fit was not perfect, with roofs of different heights and some space between the ‘houses’ forming pits, but he’d thought he had this figured out. Only now, in the middle of this landscape of roofs, there was a bowl with a cottage in it.

Not a small one, either – neither the cottage nor the bowl. The latter was maybe one story deep and large as a town square, only over the roofs a garden had been made: green grass swallowed by fields of flowers in purple and blue and red, their colors weaving in and out so skillfully he could hardly tell where one ceased and one began. A small stony garden path led to a neat cobblestone cottage, at least two stories high though one side went even higher with a little turret atop.

That turret bore a weathervane that Tristan was almost entirely sure was not moving according to the wind.

That smacked of danger to him, but also of answers. And whether this was a dream or his being cast out of his life, answers were what he needed most. The thief lowered himself down into the garden, landing softly on the grass, and crept closer to the cottage. There were great curved windows overlooking the garden – of glass, and the transparent kind! – so he went around, past the door, and eyed the cobblestone walls. The stones were smooth, but he might be able to climb up and enter through the turret.

Then the door opened.

Tristan ducked into a bush, but there was no one at the door and it stayed open. The faint lights from inside painted the doorstep. Fuck. All right, so this was a Gloam-witch’s house and he’d been caught creeping around. Swallowing, Tristan straightened his back and got out of the bushes. Best to pretend he’d always been going to come in through the front. He got back on the stone path, reached the threshold – there was a straw mat he dutifully wiped his boots on – and entered the devil’s den.

The first thing he noticed was how richly filled the cottage was. Fine furniture in polished wood, but also cushioned chairs of filigreed copper, silver mirrors and even a bookshelf casually bearing a fortune’s worth of colored leatherbound books. Everywhere seemed laden with trinkets, some precious like a music box in ivory but others as common as dried flowers and a shoddy mounted owl.

The lights inside were soft and warm, coming from candles set in cups, and the moment Tristan stepped inside the door closed behind him.

He did not need to ask where he was supposed to go, as past the entrance was a drawing room by those tall windows he had earlier seen and at the table there a man sat with a pot of tea. And two cups. The stranger was not yet looking his way, so Tristan took his time to study him – average height, dark hair and an air of softness about him. So pale he must be either a hollow or kin to Maryam’s people.

“Do come and sit, young man,” the stranger said. “It has been too long since I had a guest.”

The man’s voice was smooth and deep, almost musical, and Tristan’s shoulders loosened the slightest bit. Not because of the voice, but because even hollows did not usually lay hands on a guest without good reason. It was an assurance of safety to be named a guest, however slight one.

Silent, the Sacromontan padded over on the thick carpet until he sat on the thick padded armchair facing the other man. Finally facing him, Tristan’s eyes skimmed over a long face and straight nose touched by a bump. Classic Trebian islander looks. And he must be a hollow, else why live in a house without any Glare lights?

The armchair, to his discomfort, was almost sinfully comfortable. He didn’t know what was inside those cushions but it certainly wasn’t straw.

“You seem shy, for one of such bold wanderings,” the man said. “Might I have your name?”

“Tristan,” the thief replied, unwilling to give more. “And I must confess I did not come here on purpose.”

The other man hummed.

“Not your purpose, perhaps,” he said. “But a purpose, most certainly.”

Tristan squinted at him.

“Would you happen to be a priest, by any chance?”

A soft, almost pleased laugh.

“Once upon a time,” the man agreed. “I have withdrawn from the life, though not so thoroughly as I had thought if you can find me out so easily.”

He paused, smiling in a flash of pearly perfect teeth.

“Call me Sakkas, Tristan,” he said. “Would you like a cup of tea?”

The thief considered the phrasing, then leaned in.

“Is the tea poisoned, Sakkas?” Tristan politely asked.

The dark-haired hollow laughed, not offended in the slightest.

“My dear boy,” he said, “you are a lucent standing but an hour’s walk away from the Lightbringer’s own summer palace. In what world would I need poison to dispose of you?”

Tristan made himself smile, as if he had been aware he was apparently in viewing distance of the fucking King of Hell. Sakkas didn’t sound like someone selling a line, either, but instead as if he were stating a simple and well-known truth. Most distressingly, the thief found he believed the priest. So he swallowed, nodded, and let the hollow pour dark fragrant tea into a cracked ceramic cup. Sakkas encouraged him to try it and Tristan did.

He’d been prepared to fake a smile, but to his surprise it was genuinely delicious. Nothing at all like the Tianxi and Someshwari leaves he knew – tasted fruity, and sweet without being sugary.

“It’s very good,” he admitted.

Sakkas beamed.

“Strawberries, young man, the secret is strawberries,” he said. “I make my own jam from those that grow in the garden.”

Tristan took another sip, mirrored by the hollow across the table, then set down his cup on a saucer.

“Thank you for the tea,” he said.

“You are most welcome,” Sakkas easily replied. “Though as you earlier mentioned a purpose yet unknown, I expect you have some questions for me.”

“I do, if you would allow it,” Tristan slowly said.

He had not given his entire name on purpose, and though the man did not seem like a god in man’s guise he would not ask questions if they need be traded for boons.

“I do enjoy a mystery,” the priest affably said. “Ask away.”

The thief hesitated, then bit the bullet.

“Where am I?” he asked.

“This is the city of Allazei,” Sakkas said. “Once capital to a kingdom of some import, now the seat of infernal enterprise.”

The Prince of Lies again. Perhaps that was the thread he must pull at to unravel the truth of where he was.

“And what,” Tristan asked, “would that enterprise be?”

“That depends, I suppose, on whom you ask,” the priest mused. “The princelings out there will tell you that the isle of Solomontera is where a great empire is to be founded – it is, after all, where we raised the monstrous palace that is to be its seat of power.”

Solomontera, the thief noted, and not Tolomontera. Sakkas did not seem the kind of man who misspoke, so it must be another name for the island. An older one?

“You don’t believe that, though,” Tristan said.

He was sure of it. It had been a kind manner of condescension the man spoke with but condescension nonetheless.

“That the forges of Hell will spew out an endless tide of devils, sweeping over the world as the vanguard to our kind?” Sakkas snorted. “Hardly. It is not in the nature of the Morningstar to raise thrones, only to topple them.”

“Then what is he after?” he asked, gesturing around.

“As an archbishop of the Sunless House, I suppose I should be telling you that the Lightbringer’s plans matter little for no matter in whose service ours is a holy work,” the dark-haired hollow said. “In putting out the lights we will end the Tyranny of Bounds and release all souls from imprisonment, as is our sacred duty.”

Tristan went very, very still. He had heard of the Sunless House before, like all Lierganen. The Thirteenth Betrayal, the cult that had gnawed at the insides of the Second Empire for decades – maybe even centuries – before bringing it down on the head of the last emperor. No hollow cult was as feared or despised on the Trebian Sea, not even centuries after the Watch had put down the last of them. And now he was sitting across an archbishop of their kind, one of their great warlord priests.

He forced himself not to swallow, but the other man’s brown eyes had a knowing glint.

“You don’t sound like you believe that either,” Tristan said, pressing on.

“I am an old man, Tristan,” Sakkas replied.

“You don’t look it.”

It was hard to put a number, given the smoothness of his appearance, but the thief would have guessed no more than in his thirties.

“I look however I care to,” the archbishop dismissed. “Mastery of one’s flesh is one of the lesser mysteries. Suffice it to say that I was young when this city was young, and it is no longer that.”

“And what does that mean?” Tristan asked.

“That I know what it looks like,” Sakkas said, “when someone sits by a window waiting to die. And that is what the Lightbringer does, watching as we all squabble at his feet – princes drawing kingdoms on maps of places they have never been, Origen’s pupils hollering for holy war and the devils trying to make themselves into a court like a jigsaw puzzle where every piece bites.”

The dark-haired man shook his head.

“I know not what he intends, but the Morningstar lost all interest in Solomontera once the last stone of his palace was set down,” the priest said. “He knows the Watch has called on the great powers and they muster a host to kill us all, yet he only waits.”

Sakkas might well be right, Tristan thought. He did not yet know whether this was a dream or not, but if this was a glimpse of a time past then the island really had come into the possession of the Watch. A change the thief doubted would have come by peacefully.

“So why stay here?” Tristan asked. “Take a ship, leave.”

“It is a lucent disease, the fear of impermanence,” Sakkas amicably said. “You draw bounds between ‘before’ and ‘after’ that do not exist, find loss in the indivisible. Does water fear to become snow?”

It might, Tristan mused, if it could think it all. Souls were forever bound to the Circle Perpetual, spinning and spinning until they had become unto gods, but a death was still a loss. You kept nothing of what you had been, once you returned to the Circle. Stripped clean of anything that might ever have mattered to you. No, death was something to fear. But that wasn’t the way hollows thought.

They didn’t really see death as being death, it was why they seemed so unpredictably violent: the stakes they played with just weren’t the same as other people’s.

“So you’re sitting here by your window,” the thief said. “Sipping at tea and waiting for the tide to catch up.”

“So I am,” Sakkas easily agreed. “Yet we have spoken of me quite enough, I think. What is it that brings you to these shores, Tristan?”

“I am lost,” he admitted. “And very far from home.”

“No one is ever lost,” the priest laughed. “There are no right or wrong paths. You are ever where you should be.”

“I’m not even sure I am when I should be,” Tristan drily replied. “Much of this seems strange to me.”

He had spoken the words casually but kept a careful eye on the other man’s face. What would he think, how would he react? With benign amusement, was the answer, unless the priest was better at feigning emotion than Tristan was at ferreting out.

“Time is largely a lie,” Sakkas assured him. “Do not worry too much of it.”

This was not unlike, the Sacromontan mused, being comforted by a shark. The intention was there but the teeth were no less bloody for it.

“Yours is a very soothing kind of nihilism,” the thief decided.

“And your skepticism is very amiable,” Sakkas complimented. “It is important, the understanding that knowledge is not iron but a reed: it breathes, changes, bends. A mind of iron is ever fated to break.”

Tristan finished the last of his cup just as the first roll of thunder struck. Sakkas unhurriedly rose to his feet, pulling open a window, and in the distant sky they saw flickering lights. Not that of the Orrery but of Glare lanterns against clouds. Ships, Tristan thought, come to the port. And they had announced themselves with cannons so they came not in peace. Time to go, the thief decided.

“It has been interesting,” Tristan honestly said, setting down his cup. “But I must leave. I fear the consequences of lingering here.”

The priest smiled, leaning on his elbows to watch the signs of his approaching doom as if he were enjoying the view.

“The tide has finally caught up, I think,” Sakkas said, then shook his head as if slinking out of reverie.

He glanced back at Tristan.

“I should give you a gift to commemorate our meeting. I expect there will not be another.”

Tristan stilled.

“That’s not necessary,” he said.

“It was done long before you came here,” the archbishop easily said. “I lay here a mystery, you see, a line in the sand: none may find this house who have not tread its ground before.”

Sakkas shrugged languidly.

“You are not lost, Tristan,” he said. “Home is where you make it.”

The thief hesitated. It was a fool’s thing to ask, but the curiosity burned.

“What will you do?” he asked, licking his lips.

Sakkas smiled, grandfatherly for all his apparent youth.

“I am the last archbishop of the Sunless House, my boy,” he said. “I have partaken of the eldest law and made it into my bones, sung the words that eat themselves.”

The air shivered, as if the world itself were flinching what had been spoken, and Tristan found he could not look away from Sakkas’ dark eyes. They were pits of darkness, endless and cold and unhurried the way only something beyond time could be.

“If the Watch comes to my doorstep, I will help them remember why they should be afraid of the dark.”

Tristan forced himself not to run to the door, but it was a narrow thing.

—

The garden felt sinister now, the reds deeper and the purples poisonous as he hurried down the path.

There ought to be a way down from this place, Tristan thought as he found a lower edge to the hollow the cottage was tucked away in. In his haste he misjudged a stone, and when he put his weight on it to push himself up it gave in a spray of powdery mortar. With a grunt the thief fell back down into the grass, shielding his face with his hands so the stone would not smack into it. When he sat up with a groan after, though, the grass under him felt coarser.

As it should be, since he was no longer in that hidden garden.

Around him were ruins, gutted houses and streets akin to the Port Allazei he knew. Excitement rising, Tristan looked up and finally let out a relieved breath: the Orrery above was the one knew, the colorful false stars. Gods, but he’d never thought he would have been pleased by that eerie sight. So what had happened? Had any of it been real, or was it all some sort of Gloam delusion? Tristan rose and went patting around for his knife, finding it missing.

Yet he could have lost that when he fell through the roof, strange as it was he was now nowhere near that place. It was only when he dug up the matches that he got a definite answer: there was only one left, like in the dream that had not been a dream at all.

The thief swallowed nervously, for this sort of thing was well past his understanding. He needed to find Maryam as quickly as possible and find out how long had pas– remembering Vanesa’s watch, Tristan fished it out. An hour and change past his leaving the Old Playhouse. More or less equivalent to the time that would have passed if he’d never been… elsewhere.

How did it work? Had it- no, he thought, shaking his head. To guess without a grounding in the matter was just stirring air. Maryam first, then he could panic. The thief found a collapsed house that made for an easy climb and got onto the tiled roof, finding the direction the lights of Port Allazei were in – straight ahead, and from where he stood he could even see that a new ship appeared to have docked. Tall and slender, its sails lowered as dockworkers unloaded its contents by lantern light.

Tristan headed straight that way, putting a spring to his step as he entered a stretch of pale light.

He kept a wary eye for lemures, for he was tired enough to get sloppy, and was rather relieved when at the end of the street he found a patrol of blackcloaks. Eight of them, led by a tall Someshwari woman with lieutenant stripes on her collar. Tristan hurried their way, but about halfway through the street his steps slowed. They had seen him, but instead of a wave or a jest what he got was the watchmen spreading out in a line with their muskets raised. A second later he saw why.

Between them, in the middle of the street and going across houses, was a painted red line. Something told him he wasn’t the one on the right side of it.

“Manes,” he cursed under his breath, then cleared his throat and called out. “Apologies, lieutenant, I did not cross the line on purpose. I was caught in-”

“Hands where we can see them,” the Someshwari lieutenant harshly ordered. “Now.”

Grimacing, Tristan did as bid. How could he talk his way out of this? They did not seem overly inclined to shoot him, but neither did they seem overly disinclined.

“Don’t make sudden movements,” one of the men barked.

“They are the very last thing on my mind,” Tristan assured him.

Not so much as a flicker of amusement on anyone’s face, all of them keeping the muskets pointed and unwavering.

“Do you have a plaque?” the lieutenant asked.

“I do,” the thief said, hoping he had found an end to the canal. “Thirteenth Brigade. My name is-”

“Take it out,” the lieutenant interrupted. “Slowly, with your bare hands.”

Bare hands. Was there something unusual about the plaque’s making, then? Tristan carefully reached inside his cloak, producing the round silver seal and holding it up to their lantern light.

“And now?” he asked.

“Now we wait,” the lieutenant said. “Soggy?”

“Started the count, lieutenant.”

The one to speak had been a tall Malani in the back, who was now looking at an open brass pocket watch. A long moment of silence passed, muskets pointed at him and unwavering, and Tristan bit the inside of his cheek when he realized he should have been keeping count from the moment he saw ‘Soggy’ looking at his watch. He began late and made it to thirty-four seconds before the Malani closed his watch.

“Your hands, boy,” the lieutenant said. “Show them to us.”

Tristan did, not yet putting away the seal, and finally the tension lessened. Guns went down, several breathing out in relief.

“Congratulations,” the watchwoman said. “You are not being ridden by a mara.”

“Ridden,” Tristan said. “As in being possessed?”

“If you’re lucky,” the one called Soggy grimly replied. “But you didn’t burn under the Judas test, so your soul is clean. On which layer did you end up?”

Tristan choked. He could guess what the ‘layer’ was, but the implication here surprised him.

“There’s more than one?”

“Soggy,” the lieutenant sharply said. “Shut your mouth. You, boy-”

“Tristan Abrascal, tia,” the thief provided.

This time she let him finish, nodding.

“Tristan,” she said. “What did your surroundings look like?”

“The Orrery was dimmed,” he said. “And there were torches in the city.”

“Second layer,” she immediately said. “Yours was just a shallow dive, you should be fine. Have yourself checked by a Navigator anyway if you can, it pays to be prudent.”

“A dive into what, lieutenant?” he pressed.

She frowned, as if irked he would ask, but did not deny he had a right to.

“Tolomontera sits atop one of the largest aether wells in Vesper,” she finally said. “All that loose aether, it means that if enough taint is put out in a short amount of time it’ll make an impression into the local fabric, a layer. You wandered into the one we call the Witching Hour.”

Tristan remembered what Tredegar had told him of Brun’s confession, of how his little god had loved nothing more than the burst of flavor in the aether when men died. And so he knew where the taint for this Witching Hour had come from.

“It’s from the night the Watch took this island,” he said.

He got a sharp look for that.

“Clever kid,” the lieutenant said, though it did not sound like a compliment. “You avoided a bad end this time, Tristan Abrascal, but I wouldn’t count on a repeat if you wander back in.”

She leaned closer.

“If the mara in there don’t take you, a stray bullet will.”

He stilled at that revelation and she smiled nastily.

“Did you think you couldn’t die in there? Aether’s just as real as you are, boy, a shot of it in the head will kill you proper dead.”

She gestured for ‘Soggy’ to come, ordering him to check the plaque and mark the number so his patron could be informed he had been out of bounds – though she seemed to believe him when he told her it was entirely unwilling.

“Welcome to Scholomance, Tristan Abrascal,” the watchwoman said afterwards, patting his shoulder. “Best be more careful about where you step, if you want to last through the year.”

# Chapter 8

It was pleasant out.

The Grand Orrery lights were blue and bronze, brushing softly against the pavement stones, and a breeze too soft to push against the morning mist trailed down the street. If Song were a fortunate woman, she would be sitting in the delightful garden terrasse of the Emerald Vaults, sipping at a cup of Jigong green as she waited for Angharad to join her so she might give a full report over her evening at the Old Playhouse. They might share some of the honeybread Song had heard so much about from Uncle Zhuge, perhaps even have a word about the tension with Maryam while waiting on her to return from the Akelarre chapterhouse.

But the Ren were cursed, beloved only of misery, so instead Song she was headed to a detainment house to get Tristan fucking Abrascal out of it.

The Watch did not call it a jail, which was a balm on her heart as if a member of her brigade had gotten thrown into jail before classes even began Song might just have to throw herself into Allazei Bay to end this debacle early and spare herself further indignity. A god for opponent could be overcome, but not a pig teammate. Only the thought that this might not be of the thief’s fault kept her from growing too furious with Abrascal, who might have been the victim in whatever affair saw him tossed into not-a-jail.

Abrascal deserved a fair hearing, regardless of her concerns about the man.

The same Watch clerk to tell her he had never come back last night had been kind enough to give her directions to the detainment house that’d sent word they had him, so at five forty-five sharp she showed up at its door dressed neatly, freshly bathed and combed with her coat buttons polished. From the outside the building looked more akin to an inn than some gaol, save for the two half-asleep watchmen lounging by the door. They straightened when she approached, though their gazes remained bored.

“Plaque,” the taller of the two asked.

Wordlessly she presented the silver seal, which the watchman examined before giving back.

“Thirteenth, huh,” he snickered. “Lucky you. You’re here for the kid that ended up on the wrong side of a red line?”

Tristan Abrascal, I am going to murder you, she swore. Gods and Circle, could you really not make it a single day?

“I am sure it is only a misunderstanding,” Song lied, smiling politely. “May I enter?”

The guard lazily waved her in. The Tianxi found that her earlier impression had some truth to it: the building had clearly been an inn at some point in the past. The common room seemed much the same as before, though stripped of some tables in favor of weapons racks, and what must have been the rooms for lodging in the back were now for holding students under arrest. Inside a handful of blackcloaks sat at the table by the hearth, two of them reading while others chatted over steaming mugs of tea.

One of them, a woman of Someshwari looks, glanced back and then rose at the sight of her.

“Thirteenth?” she asked.

Kuril accent, Song noticed. Unusual, as that mountain people rarely left the continent, but some were said to turn to mercenary work during lean years and the Watch recruited heavily from soldiers of fortune – both the Garrison and the free companies.

“I am Captain Song Ren of the Thirteenth Brigade,” she confirmed. “Here for Tristan Abrascal.”

“Leftmost room,” the Someshwari said. “He’s with Sergeant Hotl, you can go right in.”

Song nodded her thanks, then moved to put an end to this mess as quickly as possible. She was but a few feet away from the door when she heard Abrascal shout from inside, jaw tightening in quicksilver anger. It was one thing to hold a member of her cabal, another to beat them. That would not be tolerated. Hand on the chisel, Song reminded herself, but wrenched open the door harder than necessary.

Only to be faced with Abrascal sitting with Sergeant Hotl over a game of cards, moaning as he lost a hand to the Aztlan blackcloak. Loudly enough neither noticed her arrival. His calamity god was lounging against the wall,  able to look at Hotl’s cards though such a thing was no doubt beneath her. Abrascal had been shouting at his loss, not a beating, and so the world was righted: Song was allowed to be furious at him once more.

“Three valets?” Tristan groaned. “The torture rack would have been kinder.”

“Do not tempt me,” Song coldly said, entering and closing the door behind her.

At last they noticed her, Sergeant Hotl chuckling and Abrascal straightening like a child caught pilfering sweets. The gray-eyed man shot her what he must think was a winning smile, which had her tightening her jaw. She hated that most about him, the way he played it all off – as if it were a game, a jest. As if this situation was not deadly serious, a potential black mark on their cabal’s reputation they might be working off for months.

“Your plaque,” Sergeant Hotl asked, leaning back in his chair.

 Song dutifully handed it, glancing lightly above Hotl’s head at the rows of golden letters hovering there and further unfolding beneath her gaze. Written in Centzon, not Omeyetl, so easy enough to read. She only had moments to peek at his terms before he returned the plaque, but it was enough to glean that the contract seemed to concern memory. Sergeant Hotl – Itzcuin Hotl, she learned through the terms – asked for her name and nodded after receiving it.

“Your man here is in detainment for being found past a red line by one of the western patrols, Captain Song,” the sergeant told her. “He told his tale of how he got there and it seems to check out with an accidental crossing. We had the details investigated.”

Song, standing ramrod straight before the two, bent her neck to nod.

“Am I to understand that an accidental crossing is a lesser offense than willful one?” she asked.

“It’s not an offense at all,” Sergeant Hotl said. “He’s been detained because while he passed a Judas test he could have been brainbent. He’s spent a night contained without going into a mania episode, however, so that doesn’t appear to be the case.”

The Judas test, Song had read, was one of the Watch’s means to determine if someone had been possessed. Sixty-six seconds exposed to brumal silver, a metal that induced allergic reactions on the flesh of individuals ridden by gods. That explained why their brigade plaque was silvery – though it must be an alloy, brumal silver was wildly expensive – but now why Tristan had needed to be tested for possession in the first place.

That interrogation could wait, Song decided.

“He is cleared of risks, then,” she said.

“He is,” Sergeant Hotl conceded.

She glanced at Tristan.

“Up,” she ordered. “You can attempt to convince me this was not your fault over breakfast.”

He was thoroughly underserving of the Emerald Vaults’ honeybread, but the world was an unfair place and she would not deny herself petty pleasures. Only the thief did not move and Hotl cocked an eyebrow at her.

“Your man is also the reason two students are in the hospital,” the watchman said. “He’s not going anywhere until your patron comes to collect him.”

Song turned a look on Abrascal, silently demanding an explanation.

“The second’s not even my fault, really,” he complained. “The house collapsed and the man got hit by loose masonry standing in the street like a fool.”

“The house collapsed because you threw a grenade at the roof,” Sergeant Hotl reminded him.

It was evidently not the first time they’d had this conversation. Abrascal’s calamity god, whose name burned Song’s eyes even to glance at when she glanced at the hovering contract, was laughing at something. Perhaps glee at violence done in her name?

“It was just fireworks, which I threw at a Skiritai student,” Abrascal peevishly said. “And he’s just fine, you told me, even though he was blinded, deaf and on the roof when it fell. I threw the damn thing and still got bruises.”

The thief glanced at her.

“It’s unfair that other people also get to have a Tredegar,” the gray-eyed man seriously told her. “I much preferred it when we had a monopoly on that sort of thing.”

Song always disliked it when she agreed with something he said. It made her feel like she had joined a particularly embarrassing circus. The Tianxi cleared her throat.

“Our patron has yet to arrive on Tolomontera,” she told the sergeant. “We have no notion of when they might, meaning Tristan might remain in your custody long past the beginning of classes.”

A pause, an encouraging smile. Smiles tended to get you further than frown when you were a young woman. Unless you had a musket out, anyway.

“Would it be possible for me to undertake the necessary duty as his captain and have him released to my care?”

“You’re behind,” Sergeant Hotl replied. “Your patron arrived late last night and sent word that Tristan here is not to be released under any circumstances until he arrives.”

Song breathed in. She did not enjoy looking the fool, which she had just made herself pass as. Hand on the chisel, she reminded herself. If anything, that their patron had finally arrived was fine news. She had many questions to ask him.

“Would you happen to know when they are to arrive, then?” she politely inquired.

Before the sergeant could answer, the sound of small commotion in the common room drew their attention. Song barely had long enough to turn before the door was brusquely opened and a man was revealed to her eyes.

“Shit,” Tristan said.

It took her a moment for her to recognize the man who entered the room, but only that, and once more she joined the circus.

Lieutenant Wen had not lost so much as a thimble of weight since the Dominion, his belly still barely tucked into his black coat and gilet. Her fellow Tianxi was holding a brace of fresh churros through a small folded cloth, one recently bitten into – he was chewing loudly, and did not bother greeting anyone in the room after entering. Sergeant Hotl got to his feet and saluted.

“Sir,” he said, “I am-”

Wen raised a finger, silencing the Aztlan officer, then noisily swallowed. Song would have thought that the end of it, but he then wiped his hand on his coat and went looking inside a pocket for his pair of gold-rimmed spectacles. He carefully put them on, resting them on his nose, and Sergeant Hotl opened his mouth again. Only to be silenced by a finger again.

Lieutenant Wen took another bite of churro and made them all wait in silence as he chewed and swallowed before finally letting out a pleased sigh.

“Ah, that’s much better,” Wen happily said, then turned a steady look on the room. “All right, my morning has now become tolerable enough to suffer through this. Proceed, sergeant.”

“Sergeant Hotl, sir,” the Aztlan said. “I relieved Sergeant Gentry, who wrote and sent the report you received, but I have familiarized myself with the details.”

“It’s a pretty straightforward case,” Lieutenant Wen amiably said. “Tristan’s a shifty little prick, but it’s the Forty-Ninth that picked their fight and he didn’t break any of the Scholomance rules on purpose. I have been told of the situation so there’s no further need for Garrison involvement.”

“As you say, sir,” Sergeant Hotl replied. “I’ll just need you to sign him out and he’s all yours.”

The fat officer bit into a churro again and Song only barely hid her twitch. Wen’s absolute lack of manners, the deliberate flouting of politeness, never failed to infuriate her. Especially in a Tianxi who should know better.

“Let’s,” Lieutenant Wen said. “The others should be waiting for us on Hostel Street by now, and I’m not giving these brats my entire day.”

—

Mere minutes later they were on the street, walking back towards their lodgings.

Song had never quite settled on whether Lieutenant Wen was yixin or not – that is, Cathayan of race but raised in a foreign culture. The blue-lipped twins on the Dominion had been that and almost proud of it, but the large officer was more difficult to place. Tristan could not seem to look at Wen without visibly wanting to wince, so Song took it upon herself to break the silence.

“A pleasure to meet you again, Lieutenant Wen,” she said.

“Captain Wen now,” the man corrected with a hard grin. “Who would have thought those years of formal complaints about Vasanti would end up paying off? I was a lone voice of truth ignored by a negligent commander, Ren, a veritable unsung hero.”

He bit into his churros with relish, letting out indecent noises as he did. Song still could not quite put a finger his accent in Antigua, which sounded like Erlangi but not quite as throaty. Not from a southern republic, that much was certain, but he didn’t sound like he had been raised speaking Machin either – the dialect of the eastern republics was too particular to the ear to mistake.

If he were yixin it would explain the manners, she thought. That and him being an asshole, which he manifestly was.

“Happy news,” Song politely replied. “I must admit I did not expect to see you so soon after the Dominion, much less have you named as our Scholomance patron.”

“It was a surprise for me as well,” Wen replied. “Here I was at the Rookery, summoned before a tribunal to determine if I was to be demoted, and instead they cleared me in less than an hour before offering me a position I’d not even applied for. Out on the first boat I was, Mandisa with me.”

“You must have distinguished yourself during the crisis,” Song said.

The man bit into his churros again.

“Nah,” he said, mouth half full. “I’m thinking instead that someone on the Obscure Committee has it out for your cabal. Since I recommended Tristan here be shot in my report on the Trial of Ruins, they’re hoping I’ll get you all killed.”

Song swallowed. Had she been the one to cause this? She’d heard rumors that a sitting member of the committee ruling over Scholomance had kin in Jigong, though they were only rumors. Abrascal was finally moved from muteness, which at least distracted Wen from her temporary distress.

“Shot, really?” he complained. “That was hardly warranted.”

“You miss all the public executions you don’t ask for,” Captain Wen philosophically replied. “Thought I might get lucky and get you tossed into a Garrison camp as a compromise, but apparently you’re the pet of someone high up in the ranks.”

“The word you are looking for is pupil,” Abrascal sharply replied.

There was genuine heat in his eyes, a rare sight. Unlike the dark glee in Wen’s, who looked like a man who’d just found a new favorite toy.

“Did I hear correctly that Sergeant Mandisa accompanied you?” Song asked, steering away from the explosion. “Might she have been promoted as well?”

“No, Mandi’s still a sergeant,” Wen grumpily said. “I had to pull strings to get her out of the Dominion, too, they wanted to assign me a sergeant from the Tolomontera garrison.”

It was not a long walk back to Hostel Street and the first stretch of it was spent in silence, so when they turned the corner Song was not surprised to find they were in sight of the Rainsparrow Hostel. Out in the street before it stood the three waiting for them: Maryam, who at last looked properly rested, then the chatting pair of Angharad and Sergeant Mandisa. Both a display of tall, attractive dark-skinned women with a lethal streak to them.

Not Song’s cup of tea, but she could understand why they were drawing lingering stares even at so early an hour.

Wen had finished the entire brace of churros by the time they joined the others, which she would not have thought possible if not for the evidence before her eyes, and seemed in a marginally better mood. A silver lining.

“Wen,” Sergeant Mandisa greeted him. “Done bullying the rooklings?”

“It’s not bullying if they deserve it,” he replied.

He spent a moment on greeting Maryam, politely, then Angharad with some genuine fondness. Mandisa did the same with them, teasing Tristan with a grin before offering Song her hand to shake. She took it.

“Congratulations on being named captain,” Mandisa said. “I hear you can get the position formally conferred if you graduate with it.”

That was Song’s aim, yes. Cabalists were outside the general chain of command of the Watch, unable to use their ranks to command regulars, but they were also answered directly to the high-ranking officers they were assigned to and could not be commanded by anyone else. It was the best, quickest way for her to be able to take on the kind of work that would restore her family’s name.

“I will endeavor to live up to the privilege,” she replied.

“Look at you, saying the Stripe sayings,” the sergeant grinned. “Cute as a button.”

Song did not scowl, but it was a near thing. She was nearly twenty, far past the age for such childish compliments.

“All right,” Captain Wen said. “I need to brief the brats and I hear the Chimerical opened here so I’ll be taking two birds with that stone. Mandisa?”

The tall sergeant wrinkled her nose.

“No thank you,” she said. “I’ll go see if our luggage is there yet, straighten out the rooms.”

“Much appreciated,” Wen said, then turned his eyes on them.

He grinned unpleasantly.

“Come on, it will be a learning experience.”

—

Despite the ominous words, it turned out the Chimerical was a little shop tucked away in a corner a mere few streets away from the tall facades of Hostel Street.

It looked dingy. The wooden front was stooped and dirty, the sole glass window caked with old dust and the shop sign faded. Once a chimera had been painted in gold, but time had worn away much of the body and all the heads save the serpent’s. The silhouette of the lemure would have been unrecognizable if not for the name of the place, which was writ on the straw welcome mat. It took two attempts for Captain Wen to wrench open the thick wooden door, and then the smell wafted out.

Strong, bitter and lingering.

“This is a coffeehouse,” Song said, genuinely surprised.

The Malani drink was wildly popular in Izcalli and swaths of the Trebian Sea, but it had never gained much of a following in the Republics. Tea was bound to too many of the rituals that maintained society.

“The only one on Tolomontera,” Captain Wen agreed. “Don’t spread the word.”

She was first in behind the captain, narrowing her eyes at the inside. The Chimerical was not any neater there, and still uncomfortably cramped. The entire shop was little more than three tables in walled booths and facing a counter behind which she glimpsed the tools to make coffee – roaster, mortar and sundry copper pots for the boiling. Yet the smallness of the shop would not have been so oppressive, Song thought, if the proprietor had not decided to fill it with a multitude of knickknacks.

A stuffed alligator hung from the ceiling, a row of green jars with froggy legs floating in preservative were by her head, a large globe whose painted borders matched no existing nation turned slowly, no fewer than seven Izcalli dueling spears were put up like trophies and was that potted nightshade in the corner? With every look she found further cluttering claptrap, none of it arranged sensibly or even in a way that was pleasing to the eye. It was genuinely awful.

“Oh,” Angharad said, coming in behind her with wide eyes. “How charming!”

Song was mistress of herself, and so she did not shoot the other woman and betrayed look. However deserved one might have been. Instead she followed Wen as he claimed the booth furthest in, whose table was currently occupied by a prodigiously fat black cat. It flopped belly up the moment the captain stroked it, purring loudly as Wen showed more affection towards the animal in an instant than she had ever seen him express towards a person not Mandisa over the length of their entire acquaintance.

“Good boy,” the captain praised. “You’re a good boy, yes you are.”

Maryam, who had caught up to her while Abrascal and Angharad stared at the globe and excitedly discussed something while pointing at a sea that Song was somewhat convinced did not exist, came by her side and shot the feline a skeptical look.

“More buoy than boy, that one,” the signifier muttered her way.

Song was startled into a snort, which she politely turned into a cough.

“The owner appears absent,” she said. “Perhaps we should-”

“Take a seat, by all means.”

It was a near thing, but Song refrained from reaching for her blade. The voice came from behind her, the counter where she could have sworn there had been no one. Now there stood a tall old man, his brown hair touched by strokes of gray. Dressed in a slashed rusty jerkin over a high-collared gray doublet and matching hose, a jauntily angled black beret spruced up with an ostrich feather atop his head, the proprietor met her gaze soberly.

His eyebrows, she could not help but notice, looked much like the ears of the stuffed grand duke owl to his left.

Wen abandoned the cat, which meowed plaintively at the withdrawal of belly rubs, and turned to the owner. He looked surprised at the sudden appearance, so perhaps it was common practice. A trapdoor behind the counter, perhaps? There did not seem to be a back room for the proprietor to live in, much less a second story.

“Hage,” Captain Wen greeted the man.

“Wen Duan,” Hage replied, his impressive eyebrows rising. “Back from exile, I see.”

“I simply cannot be contained,” Wen happily said, then patted the meowing cat’s head. “What is this beautiful boy called?”

“Mephistofeline,” the proprietor replied, smiling broadly. “Prince of Hell, felonious claimant to the throne of Pandemonium.”

And everyone save Wen went still, as beyond a row of neat white teeth was a maw of fangs. Devil, this Hage was a devil. Mephistofeline broke the silence by leaping down the table and landing with an undignified thump.

Song had half expected him to bounce.

“The Office of Opposition will try to assassinate you again if they hear that,” Wen amusedly replied.

Hage dismissed the words with an indifferent wave.

“It will give Asher something to hiss at,” the devil said. “Your usual?”

“Please,” Wen said.

The devil turned his gaze – placid brown eyes which he was not using, not really – on them.

“Your orders?” he prompted.

 “I’ll invite you this once,” Wen told them. “Do as you please.”

“Do you have Uthukile beans?” Angharad hopefully asked.

“I’m not a savage, girl, of course I have Uthukile beans,” Hage said. “Southern Tsenda, heart of the riverlands.”

The Pereduri perked up, the words evidently having meaning for her. Song had never heard of Tsenda, though she did know the ‘riverlands’ referred to a region near the border between the islands of Uthukile and Malan. It was the wealthiest and most populated part of Uthukile, on account of being furthest from the coast of the Low Isle and its infamous storms.

“Then I would have a cup, if you please,” Angharad said. “Unadorned.”

The devil nodded approvingly then moved on to the rest of them.

“I will have the same as Captain Wen,” Maryam volunteered.

A cocked eyebrow and a nod. The devil turned his eyes on Song, who forced a smile.

“I do not suppose you have tea?” she asked.

Hage sneered, turning a look on Wen who held up his hands defensively.

“She’s from the old country,” he said. “You know how they are.”

Definitely yixin, Song thought. It might explain why he appeared to care little about her surname even though as the Thirteenth’s patron he was sure to know her bearing it was no coincidence.

“You can have a cup of Totochtin gold, two sugars and my contempt,” the devil said. “Boy?”

“Water, thank you,” Abrascal drily replied.

Hage stared at him, muttered something about sacking Liergan a sixth time and dismissed the Sacromontan’s existence as he puttered about taking care of the orders. Abrascal sighed and she flicked him a curious look. He scowled.

“Coffee is a drug,” he told her. “Take it for long enough and you will have headaches if you stop.”

“You will find no argument from me,” Song told him.

She could not, the Tianxi suddenly realized, ever seeing Tristan take so much a sip of liquor without it being pushed on him. The dedication to keeping a clear mind was admirable, and perhaps went some way in explaining how someone whose contract was a glorified coin flip was still alive. His calamity god appeared to be wandering around eyeing the knickknacks, though Song could not spare more than a sneaking look without risking being caught looking.

They all squeezed into the same booth, Wen taking up a side by himself while the rest sat to face him. The captain eyed them with clear displeasure.

“I knew that this would be a headache and half when I accepted the position,” he said, “but somehow you have surpassed my expectations.”

He narrowed his eyes.

“I haven’t even been on this island for a day and I’ve already had to deal with two feuds on your behalf,” the captain bluntly said. “Would either of the people who started one of those care to explain themselves?”

Abrascal smiled but said nothing, so Angharad gallantly charged into the breach.

“It was an honor duel,” she said. “And I ended it at first blood.”

Wen eyed her balefully.

“That’s what you say happened,” he said. “What I had the patron of the Ninth Brigade yelling in my ear about was that you casually crippled and humiliated their Skiritai two days before the start of classes.”

Song had asked her to make an impression, and Angharad had. It was always a pleasure when an order was followed so exceptionally. Only Wen did not look equally pleased.

“I had to do a lot of dancing to make it so there wouldn’t be a price put on crippling each of your arms this morning,” he said. “You’re lucky that Lady Knit didn’t ask for a high price to get that boy’s arm working again.”

Song cleared her throat, the baleful look turned on her for it.

“Lady Knit?”

“The goddess running the hospital here,” Wen said.

She’d thought that might be the case. Some surprised looks from the others, a fresh reminder that outside the Republics gods were not usually considered citizens.

“They have mundane chirurgeons as well,” the captain told the others, “but if you want a miracle Lady Knit is your port of call. Not that I would recommend using her services too often.”

Wen then turned back to Angharad.

“I argued you were provoked, but still had to pay up so the situation wouldn’t get out of hand,” he said. “As punishment, the Thirteenth Brigade will not be attending the gathering in Misery Square this afternoon.”

Song stiffened. Given that every other Scholomance student was meant to be there, their absence was sure to be remarked upon. She had meant to capitalize on the repute Angharad had won them, too, firm up the alliance with Captain Ferranda’s brigade and deepen the acquaintance with the Third. All those designs were smoke if they were barred from attendance, and after the talk about the Thirteeenth would no longer be of their mirror-dancer’s spectacular victory but instead of the cabal’s mysterious absence.

“Is it not possible,” Song delicately said, “to change that punishment to another, sir? A fine, perhaps.”

Better to lose brigade funds than brigade connections. The coin would come back but not the opportunities.

“You misunderstand me, Ren,” Wen told her. “Scholomance had and has only three rules: as your patron, I was assigned here to advise you and serve as an intermediary. I cannot, in fact, give you orders or punishments. No one can aside from the garrison and your teachers, and even the latter’s authority is limited.”

He sipped at his coffee again, then set it down.

“I negotiated a settlement with the Ninth’s patron, but you are in no way bound to follow it,” he continued, breaking off another piece of shortbread. “What I can tell you is that, if you don’t, those remarkably well-connected brats will come after you with all they’ve got. I gave the Ninth a win and mitigated your gains at their expense, so they agreed to keep your troubles schoolyards ones in exchange. No bounties, no leaning on outside connections. You can do with that deal what you will.”

Song hesitated.

“It sounds,” Maryam ventured, “like a decent enough bargain. I do not think we want to pick a war so early, no?”

“If the best they can muster is to threaten us with forces beyond them, then we need not bow our heads,” Angharad opined. “On the contrary, let us raise the banner and have others opposed to their brigade flock to it.”

“We’re not fighting just them or their friends if they put up a bounty,” Tristan objected. “We’re fighting everyone who needs coin, and I’m guessing that’s a much longer list.”

None of them were senseless in their opinion. It was a heavy fight to be picking so early and against an opponent whose strengths and means were yet unknown to them, but Angharad was not wrong in noting the Ninth seemed to be overplaying their hand – which smacked of posturing, of weakness. But there was more to the decision than that.

“We cannot be the first to openly fight the Ninth Brigade,” Song evenly said. “Using their captain’s connections they want to reign as the princes of Scholomance, which means the first to challenge their rule must be made an example of to cow the rest. They certainly will cross lines to accomplish this, a complication we do not need when we already have so many plaguing us.”

Angharad’s lips thinned.

“The Third Brigade-”

“Is looking for a catspaw to hamstring their rivals,” Song sharply cut in. “We are outsiders brought in so cousins do not come to blows directly, not allies. If they form a coalition against the Ninth it will be a different matter, but that is not the situation.”

The Tianxi stared down the other woman. Angharad looked away first and Song’s face betrayed none of her relief at the challenge ending there. Her command of the situation would slip if her most reliable supporter within the cabal began arguing her decisions too much. She turned to Captain Wen and nodded.

“Thank you for negotiating the settlement,” she said.

As if summoned by the lull in conversation, the devil owning the coffeehouse appeared with a silver serving plate. Porcelain cups for all, save for Abrascal who received his water in a tin goblet. Wen’s usual proved to be not only a small porcelain cup of coffee but with a small plate of shortbread cookies sprinkled with some kind of crystalline powder. Sugar? Either way, Maryam immediately helped herself to one and ignored the coffee entirely. Song eyed her own delicate white cup, the coffee within covered with a layer of golden foam. The Totochtin League was, if she recalled correctly, a coalition of city-states nestled against southwestern Izcalli that the kingdom allowed to exist mostly so it could wage flower wars against it, regularly raiding it for prisoners and loot.  Did they grow coffee? She’d had no idea.

Hazarding a sip, she found the taste rather mild – a little smoky and very sugary in aftertaste. Like a sort of sirup. It was warm and not unpleasant, but lacked the attractions of properly prepared tea. Angharad downed her own cup like a soldier putting away liquor, swallowing without a hint of discomfort and smacking her lips afterwards.

Song had not had a good look, but what she’d just guzzled down had looked not unlike liquid black tar. Malani.

“What of the situation with the Forty-Ninth?” she asked, setting down her cup.

Wen took a sip of his own and sighed in pleasure, then set down the delicate porcelain and broke off a small piece of shortbread to scarf it down. Only after that did he bother to reply.

“I know their patron, Dionora Cazal,” Wen said. “We were inducted into the Laurels at the same time. She tried to bully me into offering a fine for their wounded, but she had thin grounds for asking.”

“It is their brigade that ambushed me,” Abrascal evenly said. “Their captain schemed as much from the moment he came to the Old Playhouse.”

That Tristan had evaded an entire cabal at the cost of little more than bruising was, admittedly, impressive. The man was not incompetent.

“That’s what I heard, yes,” Wen mused. “They were after some sort of bounty and they were the ones to attack, so as reparations I offered them one copper and for Tristan to write an insincere apology letter.”

Song choked. She had not expected much, given that the Forty-Ninth was attempting to collect on the head of a member of her cabal and that made peace unlikely, but she had not expected Wen to actively provoke their opponent. She should have known better. Wen was not help, fool of a Ren, he was another disaster in need of handling.

“How insincere are we talking?” Tristan asked.

Captain Wen opened his mouth to answer but she cut in before he could.

“Never mind that,” Song said. “There is to be no truce with the Forty-Ninth, sir?”

He shook his head.

“And Dionora still ran off with the copper I flipped her when making my offer, so I expect you to retrieve it on my behalf,” he solemnly said. “We cannot allow ourselves to be robbed this way, the brigade’s honor is at stake.”

Assaulting a superior officer would be a black mark on her record, Song reminded herself. Maryam, perhaps taking pity on her, cleared her throat and changed the subject.

“We were told that our patron would explain how our year at Scholomance is to function, sir,” she said. “Given that classes begin tomorrow, I would appreciate that explanation.”

Wen reached inside his coat, taking out a sheath of papers. He picked one out of the lot, setting the rest aside and unfolding the one he had chosen for them all to see. On it appeared to be the layout of a schedule over seven days, each split in half.

“There are five general classes,” Wen said. “Those are obligatory for you to attend as part of the education common to all Scholomance students.”

His finger went to firstday, the morning half.

“Mandate,” Wen said, “is a study of the Watch itself. The nature of its rights, privileges, duties and functions. A lot of the students with blood in the black will know these things already – some of them, anyway – but it is necessary learning for the likes of you.”

The finger moved to the second day of the week, morning again.

“Saga, which as far as I’m concerned is the most important of your classes. It involves both recent history and the study of modern Vesper with its underpinnings. You are to be taught about the world we’re sending you into, how it works and how it got to become that way.”

Third day of the week, still morning.

“Teratology,” Wen said. “The study of monsters – lemures and lares. Biology, behavior, habitat. How to kill or use them, their weaknesses and wants.”

Fourth day.

“Theology, the study of gods. I hear it’s to be taught by a Navigator, so expect a grasp of basic metaphysics to be thrown in as well: Gloam, Glare, aether.”

Fifth day, morning like all the others.

“The last, inevitably, is Warfare,” Wen said. “Not only will you be taught to fight and kill in the ways of our order, you will also be made to study skirmishing tactics on a cabal scale.”

“That leaves the afternoons empty,” Song noted.

“Those belong to your covenant,” he said. “Sometime today a letter will be sent to your lodgings, outlining where you are to meet tomorrow afternoon and be introduced to your fellow covenanters. Your schedule for the rest of the year will be outlined by your instructors then.”

“And the last two days of the week?” Maryam asked.

“Those are yours,” Wen said. “You are allowed to take one of the electives if you like – all are taught on sixthday morning – but you will get no special privilege from studiousness save what you learn.”

He picked out another paper from his sheath, unfolding it and setting it by the first. It was a list, Song saw. The electives. Fundamentals, Medicine, Seafaring, Alchemy, Strategy, Languages.

“If you’re looking to learn a language in particular, tell me and I’ll arrange for it,” Captain Wen said. “More or less every language spoken in a successor state can be taught, but if you want something rarer it’ll depend on whether there is a teacher for it.”

Slow nods all around.

“Fundamentals?” Tristan asked.

“It’s to catch up your sort,” the captain answered. “Reading, writing, numbers. Bare bones on the nations, languages and the history of Vesper. Enough of the fundamentals you won’t embarrass the Watch when out in the world on our behalf.”

The Sacromontan hummed but said nothing more. If he had felt insulted by that he hid it well.

“Professors in the general classes will regularly give you assignments, which you can fail,” Wen informed them. “If so, you will be tasked with redoing the assignment. Failure to complete all your assignments to the teacher’s satisfaction before the end of the year will see you forced to retake the class the following year.”

A pause.

“Fail to complete a class twice and your time at Scholomance comes to an end.”

A method forgiving of failure, Song thought, though perhaps there was a reason for it besides a surfeit of tolerance for incompetence.

“I was informed that there is to be a yearly test whose failure could also see us expelled,” Angharad said.

Captain Wen waved that away.

“Settle in for a few weeks, then we’ll talk about the test,” he said. “You don’t have to worry about that for a while.”

He raised a finger.

“What you should be worrying about,” he said, “is that from tomorrow onwards staying in the hostels and dining will no longer be free. Unless one of you is secretly rich, I’d start either making gold or looking for somewhere else to sleep.”

Song had not acceded company funds last night, preferring instead to take the measure of Port Allazei, but somehow she suspected that the prices for the rooms would be just expensive enough that staying in them would make it difficult to buy anything else.

“There are other accommodations in Allazei?” Angharad asked, surprised.

“No,” Song said with certainty. “He means the ruins.”

“There’s a city’s worth of walls and roofs out there,” Wen shrugged. “Figure something out.”

He drank of his cup again and repeated the same ritual with the shortbread. Maryam’s own shortbread was long gone, Song noticed, but she had not so much as sipped at her own coffee.

“Finish your drinks and wait outside,” Wen ordered. “I need to speak with your captain in private.”

“Ah,” Abrascal smiled. “The secret Stripe perks I’ve been hearing about.”

“It wouldn’t be the Academy if they didn’t stack the deck,” Wen easily replied. “Go on, then, get going.”

The thief drained his water and Maryam discreetly hid her full cup behind the empty goblet, ignoring Wen’s unimpressed look. Angharad was the first out, speaking her goodbyes, and the rest followed in her wake. The devil named Hage nodded a goodbye from behind the counter, which he was wiping, but did not bother to say anything. After Wen finished another round of coffee and shortbread, he wiped his mouth.

“Start reading up on the Asphodel Rectorate,” he said. “I’m supposed to be all mysterious about it, but that’s most likely where the Thirteenth will be sent for its test.”

Song nodded, mind spinning. She had looked for a library last night, or at least archives, but there did not appear to be either in Port Allazei. Most likely it would be in Scholomance proper.

“Now, as an Academy candidate you get a carrot and stick handed to you,” Wen continued, picking a piece of paper from the pile and handing it to her.

Song unfolded it, finding on it a string of seven numbers.

“Am I meant to know the meaning of this?” she asked.

“It’s your key to the Academy account at the bank,” Captain Wen replied. “From now on, if you hand in the class assignment of one of your cabalists at least two days early the professor will make a note of it and pass it on. At the end of each month you will be allowed to withdraw ten coppers from the Academy account for every instance it happened.”

Carrot and stick, she silently echoed. Now Song had something to ask of her cabalists and something to reward them with. Something to withhold as well, if they refused. It seemed an easy request to make of them, for some additional funds, because it was.

The point, she thought, was to get them used to listening to her.

“Thank you for the information,” she said.

Captain Wen shrugged.

“If any of your lot want to take an elective, try to get the word to me this afternoon,” he said. “You can register for another week yet, but a fair number have limited places and the only rule is first come first served.”

“I will see to it immediately,” Song said.

The officer grunted, but did not dismiss her quite yet. He looked almost reluctant when he spoke.

“Be careful with the professors,” he finally said. “I hear some might have it out for you over that whole…”

He gestured vaguely.

“The Dimming,” Song flatly said. “My family’s responsibility for it.”

“That,” Captain Wen casually agreed.

Song licked her lips.

“You seem,” she said, “remarkably unconcerned by that.”

She did not hope. She knew better, by now.

“I’ve got a barbarian heart,” Wen told her in accentless Cathayan, “as you fine folk from the old country love to say. What do I care for the woes of the Republics?”

Song kept the wince off her face. That was, admittedly, the literal translation of yixin.

“Besides,” Wen said, “I hear they called your grandfather a hero, for that first hour. He refused to collapse the three-legged tower onto the city and spared thousands, didn’t he? If something hadn’t gone wrong up in firmament and put out a Luminary, he’d be the most beloved man in Jigong.”

He didn’t do it to spare strangers, Song thought, clutching the knowledge in the darkest recess of her heart. He did it because he knew my mother was down there. Her pregnant mother, belly swollen with the second of Song’s brothers.

It was why she could not hate her grandfather without loving him: if he had not ruined them all, Song would not be alive to despise it.

“I will be careful,” she said, throat tight.

Wen studied her for a moment.

“Finish your coffee before you go,” he ordered.

Time to compose herself before meeting the others, a kindness. Forcing her to drink something she disliked, an unkindness. Captain Wen Duan laid out in a sentence, she thought. By the time she took her leave she was calm again, hand on the chisel. The others were lounging outside the shop, their chat guttering out the moment she stepped out the door.

“I have some information,” Song announced. “And we need to make some decisions.”

“We’ll have the free time for it, while everyone else is at Misery Square,” Maryam idly said.

She did not look at Angharad as she did, but then she did not need to. The Pereduri stiffened.

“Well,” Abrascal said, pulling at his collar. “I had a thought about that. There is a place I found that I believe we should go to while everybody else is busy. Somewhere I found last night, which I believe  could be of use to us.”

“Useful what way?” Song frowned.

“Wen told us to look for a place to sleep,” he said. “How does a cottage with a garden sound like?”

Very fine indeed, which meant there was a hidden defect. She was not alone in that understanding.

“Now give us the catch,” Maryam amusedly said.

The thief cleared his throat.

“It may or may not have once belonged to an archbishop of the Sunless House and be hidden by means of Gloam sorcery,” Abrascal said.

Song studied him for a long moment, then sighed.

“How large a garden?” she asked, and Tristan grinned.

# Chapter 9

When Song suggested they go to the Emerald Vaults for breakfast and conversation, it was not really a suggestion.

She had that look on her face, the one Maryam had learned meant the decision was already made and arguing was at your peril. Not that any of them were inclined to argue, the Izvorica least of all: she was still recovering from the inside of that coffeehouse. Feeling out such a strange shop with her nav had been habit, barely even a conscious decision, but what she’d felt… It had been like standing in the middle of rapids, the currents in the aether strong and wild. Lucky her there had not been rocks, else her spirit-effigy might well have been wounded.

The inside of the Chimerical had not been the overly cluttered study of a widowed trader it looked like, but something carefully arranged to stir the aether within. Maryam had known such a thing was possible, of course, at least in principle. She was no Umuthi tinker, but she understood the basics of how aether machinery functioned – through conceptual symmetry movement was induced simultaneously in both aether and the material, creating motion or some other expression of energy.

The devil of the Chimerical, this ‘Hage’, he’d accomplished what would take the finest mechanical minds of Vesper years of research and a fortune in material with a stuffed alligator and potted plants.

A sense of awed dread carried her most of the way to the Emerald Vaults in silence, which Tristan took notice of. He slowed his stride as they approached the hostel that was their destination, as if waiting to enter together.

“What’s wrong?” he quietly asked.

Maryam licked her lips.

“That coffeehouse was arranged to confuse signifiers,” she said. “I got too curious for my own good.”

It was impolite, she knew, but Maryam still sent out her nav to feel him out. Tristan always felt the same to her sense: like fire hidden away in a dark bottle, known only through heat and glint. Always warm to the touch. The thief’s eyes were narrowed when she found them.

“How bad?”

She shook her head, heading that off at the pass.

“That the devil can do this at all means he could have done much worse,” she said. “This was slapping a child to teach them manners, not an attack.”

Not harshly, but firmly enough the lesson would be committed to memory. Tristan slowly nodded.

“Wen already knew Hage,” the thief said. “And he said earlier that the Chimerical ‘opened here’, as if it has existed in places other than Tolomontera. There is more to that devil than we know.”

“This island has more secrets than the sky has stars,” Maryam complained. “Come on, let us catch up to the others before Song declares martial law in the name of breakfast.”

The woman in question was waiting impatiently in the entrance hall of the Emerald Vaults, which was opulent enough Maryam understood why Song had so wanted them to stay there. When they were escorted into the garden, she noted it was not a blackcloak but a man in servants’ clothes that led the way. They were settled on the edge of a large terrasse overlooking a field of purple and silver flowers sown with lanterns of wrought iron.

Everything about this place was irritatingly pretty, even the elegant wooden table they shared covered by an intricate gray tablecloth.

A servant was there in a matter of moments, asking their favored drink and preference in breakfast: freshly baked honeybread, a plate of fruits with buttered white bread or fresh fish on eggs with Sarayan spices. Song seized on the honeybread with her equivalent of unseemly haste – waiting for a long, pointed moment then immediately speaking – while Maryam went for the fruits and the other two for the fish.

“I shall soon return with the drinks,” the woman smiled, bowing low.

Maryam stiffened, though not because of the words.

It was difficult to explain the sense to someone who had not forged their nav – not unlike telling a blind man of colors, she suspected. Mother had described it as terazije-vid, the scales-sight. To be able to feel weight and worth with the mind’s eye, like the fox in the story of the Weeping King. Disloyal as the thought was, Maryam preferred the way Captain Totec had told it. We are as fish in the river, he’d taught her,sensing the current by being one with it.

And what she sensed in the current was someone trying to mark Angharad Tredegar with their nav.

She sent out her own spirit-effigy, slapping away the attempt, and the intruder immediately gave ground. Tredegar flinched, batting away from her ear a fly that did not exist, and Maryam’s gaze swept the terrasse. The garden overlook was hardly crowded, but neither was it empty: six other tables were occupied. Two singles and four shared, and though she looked for the guilty party no one revealed themselves by expression.

“Maryam,” Song prompted.

“Tredegar has the attention of a signifier,” she replied. “I drove them away.”

The Malani stiffened.

“Have I been cursed?” she worriedly asked.

The Izvorica almost rolled her eyes. As if it were so easy to curse someone with Gloam. Even the most bare bone of curses, those that were essentially Ancipital Signs – concentration and manipulation of raw Gloam – simply sliding a bubble of Gloam somewhere important in a body and hoping it got sick, took at least a few minutes of concentration and refinement if you did not want to be terribly obvious about having done it.

“No,” Maryam said. “At a guess, they were trying to get an impression of your soul so you would be easy to pick out of a crowd.”

“And you prevented this,” Tredegar slowly said. “Acting in my defense?”

It was easier to take offense to the surprise than read into it, so that was Maryam did.

“My name’s on the same cabal list, Tredegar,” she coldly replied. “Triglau can keep their word too.”

From the corner of her eye she saw Tristan wince. The noble’s lips thinned.

“I did not mean to impugn your honor,” she carefully said, “but to thank you for your efforts on my behalf.”

Song was staring at her hard enough it was going to bore a hole into the side of her skull, so Maryam held back and simply grunted in acknowledgement of Tredegar’s words.

“Well,” Tristan said. “That seems as good a segue as any into the first meat we must carve up, ou-”

Whatever he had been about to say, it was not to be. Not because of the return of someone’s impudent nav or even the servant from earlier but by a tall and neatly dressed young man in a formal Watch uniform. Lierganen, Maryam assessed. Mustachioed as was so often their way, fit and dark-haired. He bowed and offered a charming smile.

A glance around the table told Maryam none of them had any idea who he was.

“My apologies for the boldness of the approach,” he said, “but I could not help introducing myself.”

“Could you not?” Song pleasantly replied. “Your life must be very difficult.”

She even smiled politely at the end, like she’d not just told him to fuck off, and Maryam swallowed a grin. Song was most enjoyable when someone had just stepped on her toes, as this one had. The man’s smile grew a little strained.

“I am Captain Tristan Ballester of the Forty-Fourth Brigade,” he bravely continued, then entirely dismissed Song and turned his smile onto Tredegar.

Song looked like she was seriously considering strangling him, Maryam noticed, and the grin slipped out.

“Do I have the pleasure of addressing Lady Angharad Tredegar?”

The Malani’s face was like a bland wooden mask.

“I am she,” Tredegar replied. “Can I help you, Captain Ballaster?”

“Please,” he easily said. “Call me Tristan.”

Their own Tristan was eyeing the stranger with the faintest of frowns, trying to figure out the angle at work and more than willing to be forgotten about until he had.

“I come to congratulate you on your stunning victory last evening, my lady,” Captain Ballaster continued.

His eyes flicked up and down Tredegar’s uniform, quickly but visibly, and Maryam almost had to shove her fist into her mouth not to start laughing when she realized what was happening.

That dog was not just barking at the wrong tree, it wasn’t even the right forest.

“Alas,” Captain Ballaster gallantly said, “I must inform you that you prevailed twice over for your grace and beauty have triumphed over my-”

“No,” Song flatly said.

The man paused, turning his gaze back to her.

“I don’t follow,” he said.

“No,” Song repeated. “You do not get to interrupt my morning meal for your attempt to talk my cabalist into dallying beneath her.”

“Excuse me?” Ballaster bit back, straightening his back.

“Ah, at last we are of a mind,” their captain replied. “You are, indeed, excused.”

The man’s cheeks reddened but when he glared angrily there was not so much as a hint of give in Song Ren. She stared him down, letting the weight of her words and the ensuing silence wilt him before the eyes of the entire room – because this entire debacle had, naturally, drawn the attention of every last soul on the terrasse.

If Tristan felt like fire in a bottle to her nav, then Song was a millstone: heavy, plodding on with a deceptive slowness. It was all too easy to forget its nature was to grind anything it caught to dust.

Captain Ballaster further reddened at the continuing silence, looking at Tredegar and finding only an unsmiling, expressionless face. He cleared his throat, now unpleasantly aware of the eyes on him. Any longer standing there and he would be a figure of fun among Scholomance students by the day’s end.

“Some other time,” Ballaster said, then offered Tredegar a nod. “Lady Tredegar.”

The Malani’s lips quirked into something falling short of a smile and she did not answer, letting him retreat with his tail between his legs without once glancing his way.

“Double Death Brigade indeed,” Tristan noted. “What with the way Song just murdered him twice.”

Maryam choked and Song tried to send him a disapproving look but it was difficult for her to manage one while flattered. Tredegar was the one frowning.

“How lacking in manners, to approach a lady in such an unsuitable setting,” she deplored. “I wish we had not been quite so rude in return, but he did seem likely to linger otherwise.”

“If we are to look for allies,” Song firmly said, “we can do that better than that.”

The man was now back at his table – he was one of those eating alone – and was carefully not looking their way. Some of the other students were whispering as they shot unsubtle glances his way. The drinks arrived mere moments later, Maryam soon sipping happily at her xocolatl. The cool, spicy brew lingered against the roof of her mouth and washed away the last dregs of unease from their visit of the Chimerical.

“Something about meat on the table,” she prompted Tristan.

He nodded, setting down his cup of pressed oranges.

“Enemies,” he said. “I found out several things last night and I expect Tredegar did as well. Shall we take stock?”

“Let us,” Song approved. “Though we must discuss classes after, as Captain Wen requested we make haste in choosing electives.”

Tredegar was invited to begin, which was how Maryam learned she had not simply gone around picking honor duels for the pleasure of it. If the man from the Ninth Brigade had been stabbed while taking a swing at old acquaintances from the Dominion then the Izvorica was inclined to forgive the trouble brought to their doorstep. She liked Ferranda, always had, and Song had once implied to her that Zenzele’s contract was a very useful one.

Between that and Shalini Goel’s deadliness with pistols, even if their fourth cabalist was a bag of onions they would still make fine allies.

“Captain Nenetl was markedly friendlier afterwards, and intimated the possibility of deeper acquaintance between our cabals,” Tredegar continued. “The other significant approach was Captain Imani Langa.”

“Eleventh Brigade, the one who honed in on you early,” Tristan said, leaning forward. “What was she after?”

Tredegar hesitated for a moment.

“To recruit me,” she said. “You say she captains the Eleventh? She did not mention this.”

He nodded.

“Then it appears Lord Thando extended me an offer on her behalf earlier in the night that I ignored,” Tredegar noted, then embarrassedly cleared her throat. “I also believe some of her interest in me might be of a personal nature.”

Maryam sought out Tristan’s eye. He discretely mimed a low-cut dress and a shapely figure. Oh dear, the Izvorica grinned. She gleefully caught Song’s attention, cocking an eyebrow at the captain. On the Dominion the Tianxi had more than once bemoaned Tredegar’s infatuation with the brightly colored snake going by Isabel Ruesta and it now appeared that Angharad Tredegar was to have enduringly terrible taste.

It was the most likable Maryam had ever found her.

Song, predictably, grimaced unhappily at the Tredegar’s obvious interest.

“If that woman is not Krypteia, I will eat my hat,” Tristan shared. “She has had training in tradecraft.”

“It would be unwise to deepen that acquaintance,” Song stated, eyeing Tredegar.

The Tianxi did not, however, outright forbid it. Going easy on Tredegar again, or worried about giving orders that would not be obeyed? Hard to tell. With Tredegar’s part of the tale out of the way, they got to Tristan’s and there matters grew convoluted.

“So Tupoc Xical is spying on us,” Tredegar coldly said. “I should have expected it. He means to be a foe on Tolomontera as well, then.”

“Or he is assessing how dangerous we would be should we come after him,” Song said.

“He had Ferranda tracked as well,” Tristan pointed out. “And more thoroughly than you. That has me leaning Song’s way.”

The same was true of Maryam.

“Xical goads others so he can get a read on them,” she said. “Only then does he risk fights, when he has the lay of the land. I do not think this is any different, only that the nature of Scholomance means he can no longer rely on insults and provocations to learn what he wants.”

Song nodded her way in approval.

“Either way,” the Tianxi said, “there is no gain in going after him unless we have good reason to believe he will come after us. A reconnaissance of our own might be in order, but no more than that. It is the other threads you’ve picked out that concern me, Tristan – that a member of the Nineteenth Brigade, this ‘Lady Cressida’, helped him bring in his spy.”

“An ally of his?” Maryam guessed, then shrugged. “Hard to believe, I know, but…”

“To some souls strength is preferred to character,” Tredegar agreed. “That part I do not doubt. It is that Tupoc Xical would make bargains unless there was a great need I find dubious.”

Maryam conceded the point with a nod. At least on the Dominion, Xical had only allowed himself to dally with accords when he was a leading force within them. The moment he no longer had his hand on the steering wheel, come the Trial of Weeds, he had walked out.

“It could be the Nineteenth has another stake in this,” Song said, sneaking a look at Tristan.

The thief hummed, not denying the possibility.

“Help Tupoc’s cabal and ours get into a fight, then swoop in when losses are taken to collect on my bounty?” he said. “It’s not a bad plan, if that is what they intend.”

The Tianxi sipped at her tea, thoughtful.

“The meetings you mentioned Captain Ferranda has been arranging might be an avenue to learn information on the Nineteenth,” Song decided. “Gossip between captains is certain to be informative, if not necessarily accurate. I will attend the next one and see what I can learn.”

Maryam cleared her throat.

“The Nineteenth could be trouble down the line, but the Forty-Ninth is a threat in the present,” she pointed out. “We need to deal with them.”

“I am most impressed you were able to escape them, Tristan,” Tredegar said. “Some sort of grenade was involved, I understand?”

The thief licked his lips.

“It’s more complicated than that,” he admitted. “The roof broke when I blinded their Skiritai, and then I fell into what I thought was a basement but proved to be something else.”

“The ‘accidental crossing’ they detained you for,” Song said, silver eyes narrowing.

Maryam breathed in sharply.

“That they what now?” she said, seeking Tristan’s face for fresh bruises.

He always got bruised, it was like the man was made of peaches.

“You were in jail?” she demanded.

“I was in detainment, Maryam,” he replied without batting an eye. “That is completely different.”

She met his gaze, distinctly unimpressed.

“Did they lock the door?”

If they locked the door, it was a jail.

“I’m not going to dignify that with a response,” he haughtily replied.

Tredegar cleared her throat.

“If I may ask,” she said. “Where did you cross into, Tristan?”

“The watchmen called it a layer,” he said. “It is some sort of… place in the aether, an impression made by a particular time, and supposedly there are several here. The one I visited is called the ‘Witching Hour’, a dream of the night the Watch invaded Tolomontera.”

Eyes went towards her at his words, even Tristan’s, as save for Song she suspected none of them knew much of anything about metaphysics. Maryam herself only knew so much, having come to Akelarre teachings later than most. Besides, she must acknowledge that the Navigators were not as concerned with the academics as the Peiling Society.

Signifiers taught mostly in practicals, but that practical knowledge was admittedly still be more than anyone else at the table would. Maryam bit her lip, worrying it as she chose her words. An impression was one of those concepts that could not easily be explained without drawing on several other concepts.

“Do you know what an aether well is?” she finally asked.

Hesitant nods all around. Song was the one who volunteered a concrete answer.

“It is a naturally occurring phenomenon where aether flows into reality in great quantities,” she said. “Tolomontera is one such place.”

The Izvorica nodded. A simplification, but essentially correct.

“Aether is both a realm and an element,” Maryam told them. “The word is used to refer to both interchangeably, which can be confusing, but the simplest way to put it is that the material world has an immaterial mirror, which we understand as the ‘realm of aether’.”

She licked her lips.

“The realm is called that way because it is made up a single element, aether, and that element leaks into the material world through places we call aether wells.”

Maryam found the attentive gazes a little unsettling. Even Tredegar looked heedful. Particularly Tredegar, honesty compelled her to admit.

“You will have heard from all sorts that your emotions taint the aether, which might have you wondering how anger at stubbing a toe can reach such an immaterial realm,” she said. “The simplified answer is that your soul straddles the line between material and immaterial, reaching into both.”

Awakening her blind soul into a nav, a soul-effigy, had been the first step on Maryam’s path to being able to wield the powers of the world. To weave Gloam without first doing this was possible, but it would condemn one to petty tricks and ugly death.

“We do no matter much,” Maryam told them. “A single soul’s emanation is nothing, a drop of water in a sea. It would take thousands of deaths either all at once or in the same small place for an impression to be made on the aether and something like a god come into existence in the immaterial.”

She grimaced.

“Only the rules are different near an aether well,” Maryam said. “There is physical aether here, the element leaked into the material, and that is much more susceptible to impression. Enough a sufficiently bloody battle – like the invasion of Tolomontera – would do the trick.”

“So Tristan did not journey through time,” Tredegar slowly said. “Only tread the grounds of this… dream of the past?”

“There is no such thing as going back in time,” Maryam firmly said. “Only forward, and aether cannot even do that. Besides, there have long been arguments about whether what Gloam does is actually-”

She paused, breathed in. Prune the irrelevant, Maryam reminded herself. It was frustrating, like having to explain the intricacies of cliff-climbing to someone who had never so much as seen a hill. She had not realized until now how much of what she took for granted relied on knowledge uncommon, how deep the teachings of the Akelarre Guild truly ran.

“No, he did not journey through time,” she repeated. “The impression, the layer, it is real in the same way that your soul is real. But it is like a memory, a remembrance of what was. The complication here is the physicality of it all.”

She mulled the explanation, sliced off the unnecessary like peeling an apple.

“A layer is real like a soul is real,” she finally said, “because it also straddles the line between the material and the immaterial.”

“But my body was there,” Tristan slowly said. “Wasn’t it?”

She wiggled her hand.

“When you walk around this terrasse, does your soul also move?” she said.

He coughed.

“Yes?”

“No,” she said. “Your soul is where you are, always, with no movement being involved. In the layer, the reverse was true: your soul was the one moving around and your body was where the soul was, always, without movement being involved. But in the same way that if you got stabbed, your soul would be unharmed…”

“If he had been wounded inside the layer, his body would be unmarked,” Tredegar said.

She nodded.

“Should someone get decapitated in there, they will very much die,” Maryam took pains to make clear. “But their corpse will not be headless, the death will come from harm to the soul.”

The Izvorica leaned back into her seat.

“It is why the place where you entered is not the same where you came out,” she told Tristan. “You entered the layer through a weakness in the material, slipping in, and after your soul moving around some you slipped out by another-”

“And since soul and body are one, it was as if he had been transported from one place to another,” Song murmured. “That is…”

“Difficult to believe, I know,” she admitted. “If it helps, layers are exceedingly rare and near unknown outside the environs of aether wells.”

Song shook her head.

“Potentially useful,” she said. “A way to move around the city unseen.”

She winced.

“That would be extremely dangerous, Song,” Maryam said. “Flesh heals naturally but souls do not. They have to be mended by hand, and even then they will never be the same.”

The Tianxi looked displeased but did not argue. Maryam foresaw in her near future a thorough questioning on the risks and possibilities of traveling through a layer, until Song was satisfied she had been either right or wrong.

“The watchmen that found me were worried, Song,” Tristan reminded. “They tested me with the brigade seal to find out if I was possessed by a ‘mara’.”

Maryam whistled. There were dollmakers here? They should have been warned the moment they came off the boat.

“Nasty things,” she said. “We should be very careful if there are some on Tolomontera – their kind lingers near boundaries to steal bodies and minds.”

If there truly were several layers in Port Allazei, their presence made sense. They’d hate the Grand Orrery, but having so many thresholds around would be like a honey to their sense.

“They are sort of lemure?” Song asked.

Natural aether intellects that failed to become gods, Maryam mentally corrected. Or signifiers that… crossed lines. Only both of those answers would have begged questions she could not or would not answer, so instead she nodded. It was close enough, practically speaking.

A pair of servants arrived with plates of food, setting them down with nary a sound, and by unspoken accord the conversation came to a halt. Maryam eyed her silver plate with surprise, as it bore more of a bounty than she had expected from an island tucked away in the middle of nowhere. Oranges and pomegranates, figs and persimmons. Even a mango diced into artfully arranged little cubes, which had her nostalgic.

She’d been a fiend for mangoes as a girl, her father’s hall has kept those large baskets of them. More than once she was switched for pilfering some, hiding up in the branches of the oak in the courtyard to gorge herself on the sugary flesh like some squirrel. Only Mother withering the oak with a touch of Gloam had broken her of the habit.

She dug in with gusto, though she spared a few looks for the plates of the others. Song’s honeybread looked appetizing enough, she thought, the Tianxi methodically eating it piece by piece while drinking sips of her tea to extend the meal. Yet Maryam could not countenance how the other two might be so eager to eat eggs with fish, of all things, and those reddish spices aplenty. Maryam had never taken to fish, which she’d rarely had as a girl.

Volcesta – the town of her birth – was in a valley commanding passage from Dubrik to the sky road so they had eaten more like the hillfolk than the kings of the coast. Fruit and cattle, not fish and wheat. Before the Malani began bringing their own cattle over from across the sea her father had grown rich trading them sheep and goats at the forts on the shore.

Maryam was forcefully ejected from that train of thought by the sight of Tristan cutting into his eggs, trailing yolk all over the fish and slathering a piece of it in the yellowness. He caught her gaze and raised an eyebrow, raising his fork as if to offer a bite, and the Izvorica forced a smile when shaking her head. She would try a mouthful of the tablecloth before subjecting herself to that.

Busying herself with her plate, she polished off the filling meal of fruits and bread then leaned back to sip anew at her xocolatl until Song finished the last of her honeybread. She was amused to notice the Tianxi had only drunk half of her cup of tea, everything carefully measured. Sometimes Maryam thought that if Song Ren got shot in the gut it would be the messiness of it that troubled her most.

Setting down her green tea after one last sip, Song cleared her throat.

“I intend to take an elective class,” she informed them.

Maryam cocked an eyebrow.

“You knew that before ever seeing the list, didn’t you?” she accused.

She had yet to trace the borders of what the Tianxi did and did not know of Scholomance. Sometimes it seemed she was in on every secret, others that she was just as lost as the rest of them.

“My uncle recommended that I take Strategy,” Song admitted. “It is a study not only of stratagems but also of warfare on battalion scale and larger. Watchmen inducted into the Academy in the traditional way are taught something similar.”

Tristan squinted at her.

“How large is a battalion?” he asked.

“Six hundred to a thousand soldiers,” the Tianxi replied without missing a beat. “It is the most common kind of independent detachment under the Watch, led by officers of commander rank.”

Song’s lips quirked in a subtle hint of satisfaction, as they often did when she was asked questions she knew the answer to. Maryam, though, thought she had replied too quickly. Song had answered by rote, regurgitating something she had read off a page or heard from a superior officer. It might even be true, but the Izvorica knew better than to trust anything a power like the Watch wrote and said about itself.

The foot put forward for everyone to look at was never the limping one.

“Ambitious,” Tredegar said, and she sounded approving. “Do you intend to seek a field command under the Garrison after your time in a cabal?”

“If the opportunity arises,” Song acknowledged. “Such positions are fiercely fought over, however, so it is more likely I will eventually raise my own free company.”

Tristan let out an interested noise at that. Maryam would admit to some surprise, as though it was true the free companies were largely free of the Conclave’s edicts she had not thought the Sacromontan particularly fond of Song’s captaincy. They would grow into it, and each other, but it would take time.

“That sounds like it would require a great deal of funds,” he said. “How do you intend to secure them?”

Ah, it was Maryam’s mistake. Her viper had only smelled coin and grown curious about what treasures Song might have tucked away. The Izvorica was as well, admittedly, so she cocked an inviting eyebrow at their captain.

“Cleverly,” Song calmly replied, and changed the subject. “Have you given thought to an elective, Tristan?”

The thief nodded.

“Medicine,” he said.

Maryam made a noise of surprise. She was not the only one, for though Tredegar was pleased – as if she had a right to approve or disapprove of his decisions – Song’s face was forcefully even in that way it tended to be when she was keeping emotion off it.

“I would have thought Alchemy your pick,” Maryam admitted.

“I got much more use out of the medicine than the poisons, on the Dominion,” Tristan shrugged. “And unless one of you intends to take that class…”

Maryam did not, and Song had already her eye on a more ambitious track. Which left Tredegar. The hint flew right over the other woman’s head and instead she beamed at Tristan.

“It is a worthy and respectable occupation to be a physician,” she told him.

“People trust doctors with all sorts of things they shouldn’t,” Tristan happily agreed. “Besides, if I pull out painkillers most will assume I’m a Savant pick instead of Krypteia. That ought to make it easier to get around.”

That beam was wiped right off Tredegar’s face, and if it happened to find its way onto Maryam’s instead then that was mere happenstance. Song, at least, looked somewhat impressed.

“It is a decent enough pretense,” she said. “It might not last long, however, if you are asked about your preferred field of study. The Peiling Society is one of scholars.”

“My precise field of study is avoiding being caught out in such a manner,” Tristan mildly replied.

Tredegar cleared her throat, which Maryam was mildly grateful for. It distracted the two before that deceptive mildness could be turned into something sharper by Song’s continued prodding. The Tianxi did not mean it an insult – she was poking holes so they might be filled with something stronger – but Tristan would only see it as a stranger doubting his competence. Or worse, trying to dig up his secrets.

You had to trade with him, Maryam had understood that from the moment a strange boy approached her in the Bluebell’s belly. Anything else he would see as tax, and the infanzones had taught him to hate those to the bone.

“I was told you had poisons on the Dominion but, given the source, had not put stock in the accusation,” Tredegar said, frowning. “How did you use them?”

And there went Maryam’s gratitude. Though it did seem like an unusual blunder for Tristan to speak of poison before the Malani, so she glanced at him with a frown. The utter lack of a wince on that face was reassuring.

“As bait for lupines, and I fed a dying hollow a large quantity of volcian yew knowing the airavatan would eat him,” Tristan easily replied.

Not a single lie spoken. You prepared that well in advance, you rogue, she fondly thought. How long had he been waiting to sow that seed?

“I am unfamiliar with volcian yew,” Tredegar admitted, taking the bait.

“It is a poison for lemures and lares,” Tristan elaborated. “It did not kill the heliodoran beast – I had nowhere enough for that – but it did make it go blind, which let us trick it into its doom.”

And what a coincidence, Maryam amusedly thought, that the explanation of what the poison was would so neatly dovetail into a reminder of his most visible and selfless act of valor on the Dominion. That would feed right into the Malani obsession with equating action and character, the rotten disease teaching them that only good people did good things and only bad people acted badly. Tristan had done good things, so he could not be bad.

And he had not, by a sane woman’s reckoning. Maryam considered every death dealt by his hand deserved. She would not have kept silent otherwise.

“I heard that Ocotlan was killed by poison but that the dealing hand was Vanesa’s,” Tredegar slowly said. “Did she…”

“She plundered my stores without asking,” Tristan flatly replied. “Though I would have flavored his drink without a second thought had she asked. He was a brutal thug and half the reason she was forced to take the trials besides.”

His hand twitched, like he had forced himself not to reach for the brass watch he’d inherited from the old woman. For all that he liked to pretend himself beyond grief or regret, she had never seen the thief without it.

Tredegar nodded, thoughtful, and the stormclouds went away. Song had watched them all the while, not saying a thing even though their captain had come across just enough to undo Tristan’s nimble footwork had she so wished. But she had not, because Song knew that if Tristan was made to leave then Maryam would leave with him. So the Tianxi had kept silent and let it play out. But she never lied either, so that if this all blows up Tredegar will find her easy to forgive.

There was always an angle at work, with Song. She was not angry of it; it was a desirable quality in a captain.

“I intend to take Seafaring, myself,” Maryam said, half so they might move on in full.

Song eyed her curiously.

“You dislike ships,” she said, and it was not a question.

You would too, if you had seen hundreds of prisoners dragged into their holds never to return, Maryam thought.

“I am a Navigator,” she replied. “It is not a rule among the Akelarre Guild that a member should be capable of, well, navigating – but there are certain expectations nonetheless.”

The navigation a signifier was expected to be capable of was that of Gloam storms, preventing the ship and crew from being swept away and swallowed by the dark, but since many of her guildsmen spent most of their career on ships it was common practice for them to be capable of traditional navigation as well. It also allowed them to charge a higher price when hired onto trading ships to ward off Gloam storms, by far the most regular and lucrative work the free companies of the Watch undertook.

Sailing on merchantmen up and down the Tower Coast was not the kind of contract that brought in a fortune all at once – like killing an old god or digging out a cult – but it was solid, constant and largely riskless income. Those contracts were the bread and butter of free companies and why the name ‘Navigators’ was better known than Akelarre out in Vesper.

“It is a worthy thing to overcome one’s discomfort by effort,” Tredegar offered up.

No condescension was meant, Maryam knew that. It still felt like she was being patted on the head by a woman who thought herself her better. Swallowing the sharp reply on the tip of her tongue, the blue-eyed Izvorica forced civility.

“What elective are you considering?” she asked.

Song’s grateful look stung. It was not unreasonable of her to dislike Tredegar. She had the right if she so wished.

“I am inclined not to take one,” the Malani said.

Of course she was, Maryam derisively thought. Angharad Tredegar was already perfect, what was there to improve?

“Should my hand be forced I might learn Samratrava or Centzon,” Tredegar continued, “but before having a grasp on the demands the Skiritai Guild might make of my time I am reluctant to make such a commitment.”

That was, the Izvorica unhappily conceded, not all that unreasonable. Somehow she doubted the Militants would have the most intellectually demanding of classes on the island, but there was little doubt they would be the most physically brutal.

“Captain Wen mentioned that we yet have a week to pick an elective, but that there are no guarantees seats in them will remain,” Song told them. “Keep that in mind before giving me your decision. His request was that I pass him the choices as swiftly as possible, so if any of you are certain…”

She trailed off, inviting answer. Maryam was sure and told her as much. If she was to ever sail a cutter she would need to be trained and her discomfort was nothing in the face of necessity. Tristan committed to training as a physician a heartbeat after, and though Song did not mention it Maryam saw her scribble her own name by the Strategy class on the list. Tredegar decisively maintained her indecision, bold bravery that closed the matter of classes for now.

“We should take stock of our funds,” Maryam suggested after. “I think we could all use a little coin to burn so we might get our affairs in order before classes begin.”

“Ah,” Tristan said, “that remind me.”

He went fishing inside his cloak, removing a slip of paper which he then handed her under the puzzles gazes of the others. On it was written the number 112 and an ink seal – crossed keys inside a circle – had been stamped at the end.

“Your cloak,” he said. “They wouldn’t let me keep it in detainment so I paid for it to be kept in a warehouse. The farrago warehouse, they called it.”

She beamed at him. With a hood to pull down, she might be stared at less in the streets.

“The same warehouse where my uncle’s gift is being kept,” Tredegar noted. “We can settle both affairs as once.”

The Malani then eyed her with surprise.

“I did not know you had bought a cloak, Maryam,” she said.

The Izvorica bared her teeth.

“At that price, why, it was robbery,” she replied.

Song cleared her throat.

“It seems to me that the both of you should head there while Tristan and I-”

She was interrupted by the sound of wood scraping on tiles obnoxiously loudly. Maryam turned to see someone stealing a chair from the nearest table and wedging it between her and Song, back first.

The one doing it was one of the most handsome men she had ever seen.

Lierganen, his dark hair going down to his neck, smooth tanned skin and striking blue eyes. Closely shaven and meticulously clean, the man’s regular uniform drew the eye to lithe muscles and broad shoulders. The stranger sat, facing them and leaning his elbows against the back of his chair, and though his teeth were perfect Maryam could not help but think they looked sharp as knives.

“This is no way to make acquaintance, sir,” Tredegar coldly said.

“We are already acquainted,” the man said. “By name, if nothing else.”

He leaned over and casually took Song’s cup, bringing it to his face to take a sniff and then making a little moue before setting back down on the tablecloth.

“Jigong green?” he said. “Insipid.”

Before the baffled Tianxi could call him to task for it, he smiled.

“Captain Sebastian Camaron,” he introduced himself. “Ninth Brigade.”

Ah, Maryam thought. Shit. It was going to be one of those conversations, wasn’t it? The princeling of princelings glanced at Tredegar.

“You struck my man last night, made a fool of him,” Captain Sebastian said.

“Unbecoming modesty,” Angharad Tredegar replied without batting an eye. “I assure you, he hardly needed my help at all.”

“That’s funny, it is,” he chuckled. “You’re funny, Tredegar.”

He cocked his head to the side.

“Were you like that, before they butchered your family and put a price on your head?” he asked. “Or maybe you’re one of those sorts that put a smile on grief.”

The Pereduri went very, very still. Sebastian Camaron kept smiling.

“My aunt, she says only a fool picks a war in dark,” he said. “So, I looked into you all while your fat waddler of patron came to make terms with her.”

Deftly taking a small silver spoon, he rapped it against the side of Song’s cup – then pointed it at Maryam.

“The worst signifier on the isle.”

Her teeth clenched. It stung all the more to know that he may, in truth, be correct. The spoon moved to Song.

“The most hated surname under Heaven.”

To Tristan.

“Nobody.”

Only then did he look at Angharad again, no longer smiling.

“And Angharad Tredegar, surely the costliest niece in the entire history of Vesper,” Captain Sebastian Camaron said. “You are the only one here worth a second glance here, Tredegar, and by all indications you happen to be the worst fool of the lot.”

The captain rapped the silver spoon against the table pensively.

“Vexing,” he decided, “is what this is. Chasing you out of Scholomance is pointless – who takes heed of a broadside fired into a sinking ship? On the other hand, you manhandled Musa last night and then went about swaggering about at my brigade’s expense.”

Sighing, he rapped the spoon against the table again. Like punctuation.

“My tia agreed on terms with Captain Waddles, so I will heed them out of respect for her,” Captain Sebastian said. “You must be disciplined, of course, but after that I wash my hands of… this.”

The disdain in the last word, spoken as he eyed them all, was a heavy thing.

“I advise against coming to my attention again,” Sebastian Camaron said.

Song’s eyes were cold.

“And what will happen,” she said, “if we do?”

No, Maryam thought. That’s what he wants you to say, Song. So he can make his threat. The man laughed.

“How bold the illusion of safety makes even the least of us,” he mused. “You are not protected, Song Ren. It would be for the best you shed that particular delusion before it gets you hurt.”

Sebastian Camaron pushed back the chair and rose to his feet, contemptuously tossing the spoon onto the tablecloth.

“Twenty-seven, Rainsparrow Hostel,” he said. “Your room, yes? It will be empty when you return.”

The captain of the Ninth Brigade smiled.

“This time I choose to leave the Thirteenth Brigade with the clothes on its back,” Sebastian Camaron said. “That is the last mercy you’ll get from me.”

Then he beamed at them, nodded a goodbye like an old friend and walked away whistling a jaunty tune. They watched him go in silence. Even after he left the terrasse, not one of them spoke until at last Song broke the silence.

“Tristan,” she said.

The thief turned her way.

“Song?”

“It appears we’ll be heading to your cottage early,” she said, “for we are in need of new accommodations.”

# Chapter 10

It was a half-hour walk, most of it following the road to Scholomance.

Angharad had paid little attention to the path once they left the paved avenue, busy quietly seething at the fact they had been robbed. Sebastian Camaron had not lied. When they’d returned to their room at the Rainsparrow Hostel they found it just as empty as he had said. Even the clothes she had acquired yesterday gone.

Once more, she owned nothing but what she wore.

Incomprehensibly, Angharad was not allowed to kill the man responsible for this even though she knew his name, face and he had confessed to the crime. It made her blood boil. This was what honor duels were for – burning out evil, reminding the nobly born that their station was not only a privilege. That it came with rules of conduct.

Only beginning to taste blood forced her to stop biting at the inside of her cheek, though mercifully distraction was offered soon after.

“This is it,” Tristan announced. “Never saw it from below before, but there’s nowhere else like that in the city.”

When the Sacromontan had spoken of a hidden cottage, Angharad had expected some charming but worn-down building tucked away in an alley between larger ruins. Instead she was looking at… well, there wasn’t exactly a word for this as far as she knew. In a way it reminded her of the Trial of Ruins, the way devils had stacked temple over temple until the pile became something it its own. This was humbler work in scale, she thought, and more… architectural. Not a mere pile haphazardly grown.

The edifice was three city blocks long and three wide with matching height, roughly a cube, but it was not a single entity. Someone had stacked small rectangular residences one atop another to fill the cube, though the work was imperfect. Like with poorly lair bricks there were empty spaces between the residences, forming alcoves and makeshift halls. Some of these were filled with stairs, some kept empty as corridors and pits. The structure went so high she could not see what the roofs looked like, but even from down here she could see they were of differing heights.

There were no doubt many things to look at in there, Angharad thought, but glaringly missing was the reason they had come here in the first place.

“The cottage,” she tried, “must be well-hidden indeed.”

Tristan threw her an amused glance. Perhaps her attempt at diplomacy had been a tad transparent.

“There’s something here,” Maryam announced. “I could not tell you what, it is far beyond anything I have ever seen, but the aether around here is too smooth. Like something is keeping it from having ripples.”

The Triglau inspected thin air, until suddenly wincing and rubbing the bridge of her nose. Some Navigator trick, no doubt.

“The archbishop’s trick still works, then,” Tristan said. “That’s good news should we get past it. I’ve never come up from the bottom, but I expect if we enter through that opening-”

Angharad followed his finger, then frowned. There was nothing but a rampart of walls, windows and doors.

“What opening?”

“I do not see it either,” Maryam admitted.

All their eyes went to Song, who was frowning.

“I see it,” she said. “Like a crack in the facade, two stories high. Only I do not think-”

The Tianxi winced.

“I try to think of passing through and,” she began, then paused for a long heartbeat.

She suddenly flinched, then cursed.

“I can think of finding a path,” Song slowly said. “And see the opening is there. But I cannot think the two things put together.”

Angharad shivered. Only madmen wove in Gloam, and madder still those who trifled with their works.

“Lucky for us,” Maryam assured them. “It means we’re dealing with an Acumenal Sign –  that is to say, one that affects senses or perception. The archbishop laid an illusion, not a curse.”

“Tell that to my migraine,” Song sighed.

“Tristan,” Maryam replied without batting an eye, “this is an illusion and not a curse.”

Angharad coughed into her fist to hide the amused twitch of her lips. The gray-eyed man put a hand to his heart, affecting a wound.

“That was most unwarranted,” Tristan said.

“That is true,” Song noted. “As you’ve already been detained, the warrant has been served.”

Angharad would have liked to add something – making sport of Tristan was most enjoyable, and he ever took it in stride – but for the life of her could not think of something clever to add. Served, something about lowborn service? No, that was clumsy. Wincing at her own gracelessness, Angharad cleared her throat.

“Have any of you a notion of how we are to enter that veiled opening?” she asked.

Eyes went to Maryam, who shrugged.

“Like Ilija’s brothers in the woods, only without the man-eating monster,” she said.

There was a brief heartbeat of silence as the three of them shared glances. Ah, so she was not the only one lost. Reassuring. Tristan cleared his throat.

“Pretend I’ve never heard of this Ilija,” he said.

Maryam squinted at them.

“Ilija and his seven brothers are sent to cross woods by a witch, every night for seven nights,” she tried.

At the lack of reaction, she pressed on with a frown.

“Only Ilija knows the way so they walk in line holding the belt of the brother in front, that way they cannot get lost and the monster cannot grab them?” she continued, increasingly desperate. “Only then the monster starts eating the last in line and pretending to be them until only Ilija survives?”

“Horrifying,” Tristan cheerfully replied. “But in a refreshingly novel way, as I have never heard this tale before.”

“I could swear hearing Lierganen have the same story with the names changed,” Maryam muttered. “Or was it Izcalli?”

She shook her head.

“Regardless,” she said, “in the absence of belt simply holding each other’s clothes in a line should suffice. We need to focus on the act of holding the cloak, not the movement, while Tristan guides us to the right place.”

“And once we have been in that cottage, we will have broken the illusion on our minds if Abrascal is to be believed,” Song said. “That seems feasible, if everything goes as said.”

“Even if the Sign still works on you after and we can’t use it as a hideout, we could still use the place as a stash for things we need kept safe,” Tristan noted. “It won’t be a wasted trip.”

It was somewhat undignified, but they gathered behind the Sacromontan like ducklings. Maryam behind him, Song behind her and Angharad herself at the rearguard.

The journey that followed was strange, but not unpleasant.

The noblewoman knew that she was walking forward, headed somewhere, but the only time she let the thought fully form she was brusquely jolted out of her reverie by Song tugging at her coat. Even considering the ground beneath their feet, whether it was pavement or rubble or rust, seemed to get her lost inside her own mind. Angharad learned to focus her mind on holding the back of Song’s uniform, letting her feet move without direction.

“This is close enough. We are on the grounds.”

Angharad allowed herself to see the ground beneath her feet, overgrown grass, and let go of Song’s uniform. A glance back showed she was barely past a wide set of stairs, stone and rust descending into the dark, and then she was staring at what the others were.

Tristan had not lied, for amidst the garden – half wildly overgrown weeds, half dead earth – stood a charming cottage. And a rather large one, the cobblestone structure two stories high and rising into a turret. It was larger than the cottages in the countryside by Llanw Hall, and considering the stone walls and tiled roof it was also much better built.

“That is larger than I expected,” she said.

“Don’t flatter him,” Maryam laughed.

Angharad choked, wise to the implication, but of all things Tristan shot them a puzzled look. He was a man and a common birth, so surely he would understand bawdy humor.

“Come,” Song said. “Let us have a better look.”

The door was unlocked, which seemed to relieve Tristan. The inside of the cottage was, well, dusty. Their boots left footsteps as if walking in soot, and Song sneezed. But aside from the ravages of time, the cottage seemed quite pleasant. The bottom floor was the entrance, a drawing room by beautiful glass windows overlooking the garden and to the side a kitchen of respectable size.

They found stairs by the kitchen, leading up, and five rooms waiting there. Two dilapidated bedrooms, a locked and barred door that would require some ingenuity to get open, a reading room stocked with rows of books and a small storage. Within the storage was a ladder going up, which after climbing Tristan informed them led to a small stargazing room inside the turret.

“It will take some effort to make livable,” Song said, “but the space is there, at least.”

“I vote in favor,” Maryam announced, leaning against a wall.

She strung out the word vote teasingly.

“My opinion should be clear,” Tristan said, dusting off his shoulders.

The room up in the turret must have been no less dusty, for he was quite filthy.

“Angharad?”

The Pereduri wrenched her gaze away from the disaster and cleared her throat.

“It is a fine enough place,” she said. “I have no objection.”

Song nodded.

“It is settled, then,” the captain said. “Which leaves us to begin the work.”

She glanced at Tristan.

“Abrascal, take stock of the kitchen,” she said. “Do we have plates, cutlery, pans? Everything necessary to cook.”

The gaze moved to Maryam.

“Find out if there’s a broom in this house or anything to clean. If not, we will need to buy necessities – and find a source of water, if you can. I cannot believe a man of the rank of archbishop would have built a house without one.”

The Triglau nodded. Angharad stood at attention, waiting for her turn. She got it.

“Angharad, find out how much of the furniture is broken or rotten,” Song said. “We will likely need to replace parts of it.”

Song glanced at them, eyebrow cocked.

“I will make a list and look for a key to our mystery room,” she said. “Let’s get to it.”

It took them about half an hour to get the answers, to mixed results. The kitchen was still stocked on everything but food, though a shelf had collapsed when Tristan touched it and would need repair. They would need fuel for the cookpot, too. Most of the larger furniture had kept well, Angharad reported, and there was not a trace of rot or insects in the house. On the other hand, the chairs were either collapsed or about to and testing a bedframe with her boot had resulted in the thing coming apart at the seams.

Maryam found a broom and a mop as well as several copper buckets, but only the buckets were fit to use. There was a water well behind the house, she revealed, but it would need new rope and bucket to be of any use. Song, to the Tianxi’s visible irritation, did not find a key.

“It isn’t as bad as I expected,” Song opined, adding the last note to her list. “It is mostly the bedding that will be expensive. And if we organize properly, we should get most of what we need here in a single journey.”

Angharad cleared her throat.

“Can our brigade funds cover the expenses?” she asked.

“I do not know,” Song admitted. “Nor am I too versed in the prices for the food and supplies sold on Regnant Avenue. I need to visit the brigade vaults and find out the sum at our disposal.”

“We all have business in town,” Tristan noted. “Though in different places. Shall we split up and meet at the Rainsparrow Hostel when done?”

That seemed sensible enough, Angharad thought, until she considered the details. Both she and Maryam were headed to the farrago warehouse, so should the cabal be split… She opened her mouth to suggest a different arrangement, but she had been too slow.

“Agreed,” Song said. “Abrascal, with me. You two can pick up your affairs.”

Angharad’s eyes strayed to Maryam, who was looking back at her with the same lack of enthusiasm at the prospect of the common journey.

And to think the day had been looking up.

—

The poets liked comparing cities to living things, to beasts.

Only the pretty ones, mind you: leopards and wolves and eagles, the kind of creature some noble might proudly use as heraldry. Sacromonte tended to get the griffin, owing to old statues and a popular epic by Salivares that waxed on about the ‘lion-blooded city rising on eagle’s wings, twice-noble’. Pretty beasts, griffins. Tristan had once read they were so territorial they sometimes drove themselves to extinction by smashing the eggs of their own kind, so despite his best efforts Salivares might have stumbled onto some deeper truth.

Tristan was no poet, but he’d come to agree with them in a broad sense if not in the specifics. There was something alive about a city, be it sick or hale, and you could follow that pumping blood to the heart of the creature. Here in Port Allazei, he was finding that the vital center lay in a rough triangle of streets of which Hostel Street was the bottom. But it was on another side of the triangle that Song led him, after they parted ways with the others.

To the west of Hostel Street, past a narrow lane, lay Regnant Avenue. Paved and wide, it cut from southwest to northeast. On the bottom end lay the barracks and fort of the Port Allazei garrison, while along its length were nestled a multitude of shops and trades. Butchers and bakers, greenmongers of all kinds, but also proper tradesmen like smiths and tailors. There was even a shop that could only be called an armory, selling firearms of all kinds and powder by the barrel.

“Hard to believe they’re selling soldier’s arms out in the open like this,” Tristan noted as they passed by. “It is against the law in Sacromonte.”

Pistols could be bought by anyone with the coin, and even muskets so long as they were fowlers – hunting guns, better at killing birds than men – but the kind of muskets that might be used in war were not to be found. The Six strictly controlled their make and distribution and had banned their sale in the city by foreign traders. It was one of the rare laws the Guardia was heavy-handed in enforcing, and every year would-be smugglers got strung up for having tried their luck.

Sometimes the Six received complaints from other powers, but everyone knew they’d rather have those than face confederales armed with more than butcher’s knives.

“Sale is legal in Tianxia, usually,” Song told him. “It is owning them that is restricted. Most of the Republics have decreed that there should be no more than one such musket per household.”

“That’s still a lot more gun than infanzones would ever be comfortable us having,” Tristan said.

“That is because they are yiwu trash,” the Tianxi replied in the casual tone of someone stating a commonly known fact. “A people armed are answerable to, and the only answer to affronted dignity is uprising.”

The thief eyed her with surprise.

“I thought you a moderate, as far as these things go,” he said.

She had certainly wasted no time cozying up to nobles on the Bluebell.  The silver-eyed woman snorted.

“I am no Yellow Earth fanatic, arguing that we must liberate all Vesper by powder and sword, but I am certainly no royalist,” Song sneered, speaking the word with utter disdain. “Jigong spent most of the Cathayan Wars either under the Imperial Someshwar’s boot or being sacked by it. We have seen the true face of kings, Tristan, and care little for it.”

Song shrugged.

“Still, most of Vesper keeps nobles,” she said. “In time all will be free under Heaven, but until then we must keep to what is instead of what will be.”

“Practical,” Tristan conceded.

“The northern republics have to be,” she said. “Unlike the Sanxing, we do not have the luxury of sharing borders only with each other and the sea.”

The Three Stars, that word meant. The three southernmost republics of Tianxia, which also happened to be the largest and most powerful of the lot. They were the victors of the Cathayan Wars, as much as anyone could be called that, and had led the liberation of what was now Tianxia from Izcalli and the Someshwar. He flicked a glance her way, having caught the faint distaste at their mention. She did not elaborate, however, and he did not ask.

It had been a surprisingly cordial conversation and Song had grown more congenial since the cottage – and a demonstration of him being useful – but Tristan was under no illusion that the nature of their rapport had changed.

Having come to Regnant Street from further west and gone up its length to the northeast the pair had begun to approach the junction to the last third of the triangle: Templeward Street. They were not to go all the way, as their destination was the brigade vaults somewhere ‘inside’ the triangle, so he asked the Tianxi about it. Song laid it out for him, precise and methodical.

If Regnant Avenue had been concerned with practical goods like food and supplies, she said, then Templeward was concerned with the thoroughly impractical. In a word, luxuries. Song elaborated when pressed, listing a teashop with a garden terrace, a draper of silks and velvet, a clockmaker and no less than three launderers. And that was not even the whole of it, she assured him.

“There was a shop of curios and antiquities,” Song said, the two of them finally leaving Regnant for a side street. “And more structures further south the street I did not take the time to inspect.”

“That is an extravagant amount of extravagance,” Tristan flatly replied. “Even accounting for the presence of Watch princelings with coin to spend.”

Even assuming, generously, that a tenth of the four hundred students and change attending Scholomance were wealthy and feckless enough to buy silks and clocks for their quarters on the island, that was a mere forty souls. There were much too many shops catering to the wealthy for the wealth actually present. The garrison might indulge as well, he adjusted as a moment. But only the officers would be able to afford it, and there cannot be that many.

“It might not be as excessive as you think,” the Tianxi said. “For one, I expect the clockmaker will do brisk business with Umuthi students. It may be that some of these shops have similar uses.”

Tristan hummed, considering that. If covenant classes gave their students assignments requiring to dip into the luxury shops the entire affair might be sustainable, barely. Maybe. He’d have to get his hands on ledgers to be sure and he suspected those fine shopkeepers would not simply hand them over if asked.

“Seems thin on the ground,” he finally said.

He kept a careful eye on Song, wondering if offense would be taken. Instead she sighed, nodding.

“My guess is that it is an investment on the part of the owners,” she said. “Next year more students will come to Scholomance. We may be too few for them to truly profit now, but…”

Tristan picked up where she trailed off.

“In a few years, they will have the numbers and be established with students in a manner that would be difficult for latecoming competition to overcome,” he mused. “There is sense to that. So Port Allazei feels empty because it is as boots were are not yet filling, so to speak.”

“It is only a guess,” Song said. “We know unfortunately little of this place.”

And Song more than he, Tristan thought as he followed the Tianxi turning a corner to the right. She had guided them without once getting lost, not familiar with the streets but having clearly found landmarks to orient herself by. It was cleverly done, he thought, and he could only be glad one of their cabal had taken the opportunity to get the lay of the land.

“You should mark this neighborhood well,” the Tianxi said gesturing around them. “It is empty at this hour, but last evening many of the houses were full.”

Tristan cocked his head to the side, eyed sliding over the winding rows of stone houses with faded red tiles for roof. There were precious few ruins and collapsed buildings here, he had noticed, and many houses had wooden shutters or drapes. A sign they were inhabited.

“The shopkeepers live here,” he said. “Some officers from the garrison as well, I wager.”

“Their families as well, for both,” Song told him. “I have seen no young children, but some older ones were afoot playing in the street.”

“Rich living, having both a shop and home,” Tristan said. “Enough I doubt they own either.”

“I do not know if the Watch charges rent, in truth,” Song told him. “Regardless, I came across more than one student taking a look at empty houses last night. I imagine many brigades will be moving into the neighborhood over the coming week as the hostels begin to cost coin.”

The conversation petered out as they turned another corner and came in sight of what could only be the brigade vaults. He was mildly amused to see the blackcloaks had appropriated an old temple for their treasury: the tall house of yellowing stone still had alcoves on the sides where worn pedestals for statues stood. A pair of watchmen flanked the front gate, eyeing them as they approached, and demanded to be shown their brigade plaque before allowing them entry.

After they did one of the guards hit the great wooden gate with the pommel of his sword, thrice, and after a moment Tristan heard the sound of a metal latch being pulled up. The pair of them were ushered into the building without further ceremony.

Within a heartbeat of entering his footsteps stuttered, as did Song’s.

Every wall and ceiling of the once temple’s antechamber was covered with bas-relief of human skulls. Not an inch was spared, not a nook or cranny. The blackcloak who had gestured for them to enter let out a happy little laugh, grinning at their faces.

“I’ll never get tired of that,” she said. “Come on, kids. Coin’s inside.”

Song obeyed, face already a smooth mask of calm, and Tristan followed. Except for the same unfortunate taste in relief, the room past the antechamber was nothing remarkable. It had been filled with four desks, each of which was manned by a blackcloak clerk, and chairs had been set down for them to fill. Song asked a bored-looking Someshwari clerk about the Thirteenth’s funds while he sat by her side, learning that the vault currently held twenty-five gold ramas and that the same sum would be added on the first of the following month so long as they remained four members.

Tristan stared at the brown-skinned clerk, stunned. Twenty-five gold a month? For four of us, the thief reminded himself. It was still a significant sum, but not as large as it would be for a single man.

“I will withdraw five ramas,” Song said. “Three in kind, one in silver arboles and for the last two thirds in coppers.”

Song had to show her plaque again and to sign for the withdrawal, but there were no other formalities to go through. A watchman headed out back, and after some wait they were handed a fat pouch of coin. Tristan frowned. The brigade vaults would be difficult to burgle, given that there appeared to be only one way in and out of the old temple and a similar bottleneck to access the back of the building where they were keeping the funds, but fooling the clerks did not seem overly difficult.

All you needed was a plaque from that brigade, a name – the clerk had checked for Song’s on a list after she gave it – and some care. Biting his tongue, he waited until they were out of the temple and then out of earshot to speak.

“I would recommend we get our coin out of there as quickly as possible,” he bluntly said. “It is much too easy to steal from.”

Song frowned.

“You exaggerate,” she said.

He took it as the invitation to contradict her that it was.

“I don’t,” Tristan replied. “With about ten coppers’ worth of cosmetics, a change of clothes and your face I could empty one of the vaults today.”

He had expected for his words to be dismissed, or perhaps an argument to follow, but what Tristan got instead was Song Ren stopping so she could face him full and turn that unsettling silver stare on him. He cocked an eyebrow at her.

“Whose?”

“Pardon?” he asked.

“Whose vault, Abrascal?” Song asked.

Wait, was she really…

“The Forty-Ninth’s,” he said.

Silver eyes narrowed.

“Keep talking,” Song Ren ordered, and the thief grinned.

—

Angharad found the farrago warehouse to be a strange mixture of the laudably organized and the reprehensibly chaotic.

The building, though nestled between old and elegant stone structures, was mostly wood and recently built. It fit in appearance what one’s imagination would muster at the words ‘port warehouse’, a broad rectangle filled with crates and barrels forming broad alleys to walk through. There did not, however, appear to be any kind of order to the goods within beyond that shallow bottom line.

Just past the door a harried-looking woman of middle age sat at a desk, frowning down at a ledger she was messily crossing with lines. Past her a brown-skinned watchman was idling on a crate, blowing at a steamy mug of tea.

“If you don’t have a paper slip, leave,” the woman said, eyes still on the ledger. “This isn’t a shop, it’s-”

Angharad cleared her throat and approached, Maryam trailing behind her. The Triglau was not her preferred company, but she too had business here. Song’s assignments were apt, if not particularly pleasant. Still, fifteen minutes of walking in silence was better than the same spent sniping so the Pereduri felt it in bad faith to complain too much.

“I have a letter,” Angharad said, producing her uncle’s words.

The disheveled woman – a sergeant, by the pin on her collar – looked up from her work. Her stare slid past the noblewoman, coming to rest on Maryam, and there the watchwoman’s eyes widened in surprise. Before tightening again, in irritation.

“You again,” she bit out. “I told you last time, girl, I don’t care if you have a name and a plaque I won’t let you-”

Angharad frowned at her companion. What business had Maryam had here? The Triglau cut through the watchwoman’s words by revealing Tristan’s paper slip.

“Fine,” the woman sighed. “You, Malani, give me that letter.”

The Pereduri glowered at her, but the sergeant only snorted and snatched the paper from her hands. She brought it closer to her lantern, eyes scanning the lines, then grunted.

“I remember those,” she said. “The long crate and the casket. Sergeant Chen’s shift.”

The watchwoman blew on the pages where she had been crossing out words, drying the ink, then began thumbing through the ledger. After a moment she let out a little noise of satisfaction.

“Three hundred and three,” the sergeant announced.

She then eyed Maryam.

“I guess you weren’t full of shit after all,” she said. “Still, rules are rules.”

The Triglau’s pale face betrayed not a speck of her thoughts as she approached.

“So they are,” Maryam said. “Here’s mine.”

She offered up the paper, which got a quick look.

“One hundred and twelve,” the sergeant called out. “You hear both of those, Bibi?”

“Don’t call me that,” the brown-skinned man mildly replied, putting down his mug. “Three o three and hundred twelve, I heard you.”

Rising, he stretched his limbs and sighed.

“Come on, you two,” the watchman said. “Let’s not dawdle, it wouldn’t do for my tea to get cold.”

Angharad almost rolled her eyes. Such professionalism. Maryam, however, lingered by the desk.

“I don’t suppose,” she said, “that you happen to remember what time I came by?”

The sergeant eyed her strangely.

“Just a lick before five,” she said. “Is your memory going, girl?”

“Just curious,” Maryam smiled.

‘Bibi’ made an impatient noise and the Triglau pulled away. The pair of them followed after him, into the depths of the poorly lit warehouse. Angharad cleared her throat.

“You have been here before?” she asked.

Maryam’s face tightened. So it was as Angharad had suspected: the Triglau had, out of spite, tried to get at Uncle Osian’s gift. To steal it, destroy it? Who knew. Sharp anger bloomed. For one meant to be part of the same cabal to-

“I spent the night in an Akelarre chapterhouse with only one way in or out,” Maryam quietly said. “And left it around five thirty when Sergeant Mandisa came to fetch me.”

Angharad’s steps stuttered, as did her righteous anger.

“The sergeant lied?” she whispered.

“I don’t know,” the Triglau replied, openly frustrated.

She must be anxious indeed to be this blatant in her emotions. Maryam rarely deigned to show more than dislike when Angharad was about. Still, it appeared she had been too swift in her accusation. Though never spoken out loud, the thoughts shamed her. The noblewoman was reluctant to give apology regardless.

What good would it do?

The blackcloak led them first to Maryam’s cloak. Soon they were standing before a large open crate filled with straw, partitioned into smaller compartments. Numbers were carved in front of each compartment and the watchman slid a finger across until he had found one hundred and twelve. Digging into the straw, he yanked out a heavy black cloak with a lightly embroidered hood.

“All yours,” he said, and handed it over to Maryam.

The Triglau slid it on without a word. To Angharad’s critical eye it was too broad at the shoulders and slightly frayed at the hem but Maryam had implied the acquisition to be inexpensive. It occurred to her, after a moment, that it might be the hood – she had seen precious few on cloaks here – that interested the pale-skinned woman. The streets were largely empty, at this hour of the day, but Maryam had still drawn stares on their way to the warehouse.

Angharad had yet to see another Triglau on Tolomontera, and doubted she would.

“Now the rest,” the watchman hummed, putting a spring to his step.

Her uncle’s gift was deeper in, but a lantern had been hung close so they saw well enough. Their guide stopped by a hollow between two tall crates, leaning in and removing a plain wooden casket that he set down to the side. With a grunt he then pulled out a long wooden crate about five feet long but less than a foot wide and hardly even a foot long. The watchman got it clear out for them, then popped the lid open with a length of metal. It still lay atop the contents, though, revealing nothing to Angharad’s eager gaze.

“There’s your goods,” he announced. “The casket I set aside too. You’ll be inspected on your way out, so don’t get grabby.”

Gritting her teeth and the implied accusation of thievery, Angharad glared at his retreating back. She hoped his tea was tepid. Maryam cleared her throat, eyeing the crate, and the Pereduri knelt with a sigh. Setting the lid aside, she let her brow rise when she saw the contents.

Muskets lay in a bed of straw, four of them and unusually long. In a corner of the crate there was a silken red pouch. Angharad reached for that first, finding it heavy to the hand and clinking. Coins? She loosened the strings, peering inside, and found the gold luster of Sacromonte coinage – ramas. At least twenty pieces, she decided, perhaps more.

Good, she could repay Tristan by the hour’s end. The debt had been weighing on her.

“Useful gifts,” Maryam said, tone approving. “May I?”

Angharad glanced her way and found her kneeling by the muskets, hand just shy of taking one. She shrugged her assent and the Triglau took it, inspecting it curiously. It was only when she glanced inside the barrel she let out a surprised noise.

“Is it deficient?” Angharad asked.

It seemed unlike her uncle to send a broken gift, but perhaps he had been fooled by some merchant. Mostly she was puzzled at having been sent muskets at all, given that she was not a trained shot.

“There are grooves inside the barrel,” Maryam said. “Those are rifles, not muskets.”

“I do not know the difference,” the noblewoman admitted.

“They shoot further than muskets and more accurately, I think,” the Triglau said. “Though I hear they are also delicate things, and slow to be loaded.”

She then flipped around the rifle, showing Angharad the side of the wooden heft.

“That’s a word in Umoya, isn’t it?”

The Pereduri cocked her head to the side, reading the isibankwa discreetly carved there. She nodded, for it was.

“It means lizard,” she said.

“Lizard,” Maryam skeptically repeated.

Angharad’s lips quirked. It seemed that she, too, had a story to tell. If her own happened to be better told than the Triglau’s well, she would be satisfied in that.

“It is from an old Malani tale, almost old as Morn’s Arrival,” she said. “When the Sleeping God was yet the Waking God and making the world, he created mankind. First he decided they were to be as mountains and rivers, undying, and sent the fastest of all birds to tell them these news. But the bird, arrogant, stopped by a river to gorge on berries as it knew even so it would still make fine time.”

How long had it been since Father had told her that tale? She could not remember the years, only that she had been young. It was one of the rare tales from Malan he’d liked. Perhaps not so coincidentally, most Redeemer priests believed it to flirt with heresy.

“The Waking God grew angry at this laziness,” Angahrad continued, “and sent out a lizard to tell mankind they were instead to be as trees and animals, mortal. Only the bird saw the lizard, and in haste took flight.”

She cleared her throat, for Father had there made sounds and mimed the action but she saw no need to mimic that performance for Maryam Khaimov. Who, it must be said, was listening with seeming interest. It was more than Angharad had hoped for.

“The bird was so fast it would still have arrived first, so the God turned its feathers to silver and the weight made it fall it into the river. The lizard arrived first, announcing death, and in shame the bird took oath never to leave water – so turning into the first fish.”

Angharad hummed, pleased she had recalled it all without flaw.

“That is why we are mortal,” she finished, “and why fish die when they leave water.”

“So the rifles,” Maryam slowly said, “are named after the quick-footed giver of death.”

She nodded. The Triglau looked greatly pained.

“That is,” she admitted with great reluctance, “pretty catchy.”

Angharad did not quite allow herself to be smug, though she conceded to a quirk of the lips. No more, however. It wasn’t as if her uncle had named the rifles, though perhaps he had mentioned the tale to whoever did. As neither intended to carry the crate out, they removed the rifles and Angharad put away her uncle’s generous gift of coin. Only after putting the lid back on the crate did she recall the slender wooden casket, retrieving it and setting it atop the lid.

There was a latch, so Angharad knelt again to work it open. It popped open with a sharp tock, revealing red cloth wrapped around a long and thin object. She undid the knot and the wrap, heart beating against her throat, and only stopped when the whole of the sheathed saber was revealed.

 It was, Angharad mutely thought, a beautiful piece.

Practical in its use of leather and steel, made for use and not mere ceremony, but the chape – the metal tip at the end – was sculpted into a pair of harps. As for the locket it was made of the traditional rings of steel, but over them the two-tailed snake of House Tredegar was stamped in elegant silver.

Fingers trembling, she pulled the saber halfway out. Steel flashed in the lantern light, the blade pristine save for a discrete maker’s mark near the cross-guard that looked like a stalk of wheat. The guard was steel but touched with silver tips suggesting a forked tongue, the grip fine leather wrap ending in a rounded, angled pommel. Gorgeous work.

Her eyes burned.

Clearing her throat, she slid the blade back into the sheath. It should have made her happy, this gift. Her uncle must have spent a fortune on it and it was a loving gesture besides. Only, looking at the elegant work before her, she could only think of the saber she had left behind on the Dominion at the bottom of some dark cliff. Her father’s gift, traded for lives and honor.

It was unfair to compare the two, a disservice to Uncle Osian to… Angharad swallowed, mouth dry. And yet. Her last scabbard, it’d had rings on the chafe instead of the locket. Four of them? Angharad breathed in sharply. No, five. She could not remember. Not for sure.

Something like panic seized her by the throat. She could not remember.

“A valuable gift,” Maryam said, leaning against a wall of crates. “Your uncle is a fine kinsman.”

Angharad closed her eyes, trying to get her breathing even. She would not shame herself by weeping for no reason. She needed to get up, to move – Maryam had not said it, but there was an expectation in the Triglau’s voice that they were to leave now. Take the gifts and go.

Only Angharad’s limbs were lead. Her fingers shook against the scabbard, the silver rugged to the touch. She licked her lips.

“Do you have family, Maryam?” she asked.

Her voice came out rough. A moment of silence followed. Angharad did not quite dare face the other woman. Breathe, she told herself, eyes still closed. In and out, in and out. Only her heart was a horse gone wild, its eyes white.

“My aunt may still live,” Maryam finally said. “I am unsure.”

It helped, listening to someone else speak. Thinking about something else, anything else. The Triglau’s voice was unreadable.

“But not your parents,” Angharad said.

“No,” Maryam Khaimov softly said, “not my parents.”

She heard Maryam push off the crates, lightly step forward. It was cowardice, but Angharad did not open her eyes even when she felt the other woman looking. She was shaming herself enough already. Only instead of the barb she was steeling herself for, she heard Maryam kneel next to her. Not so close she could feel the warmth, but enough if she reached out she would find the other woman.

In and out, Angharad ordered herself. Breath by breath, until her heart calmed. Not that her limbs ceased trembling. The Pereduri felt sweat on her back, as if she had been fighting for her life. She spoke, if only so that she might know something else than the dull, panicked rattle inside her head.

“Was it us?” she asked, voice gone throaty. “Malan, I mean.”

Is that why you hate us all to the bone? Maryam did not answer, at first, and Angharad almost flinched. Fool she, to ask about such a-

“My father,” Maryam said, “died of gout. His heart gave.”

Angharad hid her surprise. Gout was called the rich man’s disease and with good reason. Was Maryam from a wealthy household?

“It’s my mother the Malani got,” she said. “Only they were not, Angharad Tredegar, content with killing her.”

The pause there felt like a blade leaving the sheath.

“They stripped her, beat her and impaled her on a wooden stake.”

Angharad swallowed.

“I am told,” Maryam softly said, “that it took her hours to die.”

Sleeping God, impalement? It was a rare punishment these days, reserved only for the worst of rebels and traitors. The practice was a holdover from the dark days before the Peace of Nine Oaths, when a thousand kings had ruled the land with red laws and redder hands.

“I am-” Angharad began, then stopped.

Sorry? She was, for impalement was a cruel way to die. Cruel enough that Maryam’s mother must have done something to earn it, but could such a thing really be earned?

And though Angharad could say that she was sorry, she also knew that the word would mean nothing to Maryam coming out of her mouth. No more than some induna bemoaning the end of House Tredegar would mean something to Angharad, for what weight did the word hold when it was the only recompense offered?

If the apology of the lips did not reach the hand, it had only the worth of a breath.

“I do not know what to say,” she finally admitted.

She could not see it, but she felt it – Maryam clenching like a fist, something in her tightening until it creaked.

“That might be the wisest thing you ever said to me,” she replied, tone sharp. “What is it about that saber that picked at your scabs, Tredegar, that you saw fit to pick at mine?”

She did not want to answer, not really. But it was owed, if not by honor then at least by right. Angharad opened her eyes, breath almost steady, and found her uncle’s saber waiting for her.

“I had a saber, on the Dominion,” she said. “It was a gift from my father.”

A noise of acknowledgement.

“Song told me you lost it fighting off the cultists,” Maryam said.

I lost it refusing the Fisher, Angharad thought. And that loss was not forced on me, I was a choice. So why does it now unmake me, looking at the arms that would replace it? The Pereduri stared at her uncle’s gift, breathing out slowly. Steadily.

“It is not about the saber,” Angharad whispered. “Only – only that sometimes I think the cruelest part of a death is what follows after it.”

Her stomach clenched. It had been months now since she last dreamt of screams on the wind, but right now she could almost smell the smoke.

“Seeing it happen, that grief, it is…” she trailed off, licked her lips. “Like putting a hand to fire, Maryam. It hurts, and it stays, but it is a candid sort of hurt.”

She felt Triglau’s heavy gaze on her but did not meet it.

“It is what comes after that creeps in through every crack,” Angharad confessed. “A song my mother loved found on a sailor’s lips. Speaking a courtesy my father taught me. Hearing children laughing and thinking of…”

She swallowed.

“My cousins, Maryam, they were just boys.”

Angharad wearily laughed.

“There is no vigil that will keep you from that, the remembrances the world springs on you. Thorns in the flesh. And still I would hold them tight, drive them in, because otherwise…”

She let out a ragged breath.

“My saber’s scabbard, I-,” she stammered. “I can’t remember how many rings there were on the chafe. Four, I think, but it might have been five. And it is a fool thing to be undone by, but I cannot remember.”

Her finger clenched until her nails dug into her palms.

“I did not care enough to mark the detail, when my father first gave it to me,” she whispered. “I was pleased with the gift, with the blade and the occasion, but it was not a treasure to me.”

She had known nothing, then, less than nothing.

“Only by the time I stepped onto the Bluebell,” Angharad continued, “it was the last thing I had of him. It mattered then – should always have mattered, but in the throes of plenty I never gave a thought to lack. So now here I am, wondering how many rings there were on that scabbard.”

How wretched, that she would be here kneeling besides a stranger who despised her and the words would simply not cease leaving her mouth.

“I simply do not remember, Maryam,” she said. “I am a tree shedding leaves, one by one. Small things, now, but that will not last. How long before I forget what my mother’s face looked like, the sound of my father’s voice?”

Maryam Khaimov did not answer, did not so much as move a finger. Perhaps that was why Angharad had said it all – she was confessing to a statue, not a woman. Maryam’s silence was as resounding as in a temple to the Sleeping God. A pale hand rose before the both of them, the other woman silently tracing a symbol against thin air. A circle, and something more intricate within it. There was the slightest sighs in the air.

A moment of silence followed.

“Five rings,” Maryam said. “Your scabbard had five rings on it.”

And though no explanation followed, Angharad believed her.

“My people do not call themselves Triglau,” Maryam said. “All those born below the Broken Gate are of the Izvoric, so I am Izvorica.”

The pale-skinned woman rose to her feet. She opened her mouth and Angharad found hesitation there, suddenly overcome.

“It doesn’t help,” Maryam brusquely said. “Remembering it. It’s just carrying their coffins on your back.”

“Some weights are worth bearing,” Angharad said.

“I used to think that too,” Maryam replied.

They did not speak another word to each other until they found the others.

# Chapter 11

“The pork?”

“Nine coppers a pound,” Abrascal replied as he slid onto the bench.

The tip of Song’s reed pen scratched against the paper, adding the latest price to the list. Poultry seemed marginally less expensive than pork, but the costs were more or less the same across the board. Frowning down at her work, an orderly cluster of names, goods and prices, the Tianxi fit the pieces together.

“We will have to rely on fish,” she finally said. “And rice.”

It had surprised her how cheap bags of rice were on Tolomontera. Though it was hardly an uncommon crop in Old Liergan, it was not a staple the way it was in Tianxia and the Someshwar.

“Maryam’s going to have a fit,” Abrascal snorted. “Did you see the face she made when I ordered ojo de pez this morning?”

Song took a moment to translate the Antigua – ‘fish eye’, more or less – and matched the meaning to the plateful of fish and eggs Angharad and the Sacromontan had taken for morning meal.

“She will have to grow used to it,” Song said. “It is the cheapest meat by far.”

“Well, we’re not living in Farm Allazei,” Abrascal drawled back.

Song did not roll her eyes at the feeble humor, though it was a close thing. The thief’s continued attempts at being charming were, at least, without witnesses: they were alone in the dining hall.

The Rainsparrow Hostel had neither a terrasse nor a garden, being an inferior establishment to the Emerald Vaults in every way. For eating what it offered was a sparsely decorated hall – drapes and tapestries hung from the walls – set with long tables, more a cantina than a true establishment. There were no servants doing the catering here, the guests instead invited to order at a counter in the back and choose their own table to eat.

After leaving word out front for Angharad and Maryam to be sent their way when they arrived, the pair had claimed at table in the corner and begun the work of accounting for their stay on Tolomontera. It mostly involved Abrascal venturing out to find out prices in shops while Song sat and took notes, putting together passable meals as she remained behind to ensure someone would be there should the others arrived.

She was on her second cup of water, but Abrascal was so often on his feet his first was still halfway full. Setting down the reed pen, Song looked up into the dark-haired man’s frowning stare. It seemed that, just like her, he could tell something was off.

“Suspicious, is it not?”

He sharply nodded.

“Those prices are too low,” he said. “There’s no way any of those shops are turning a profit.”

Reaching for his cup, he sipped absent-mindedly and set it down.

“Back in the City, if I stretched my leftovers and planned well I could live off about five coppers a day in food,” Abrascal said. “Now, let’s be conservative and double it-”

“More than that,” Song interrupted. “We will do strenuous physical exercise and keep long hours, both of which require good meals to compensate for. One portion of meat, one of rice and another third.”

He whistled, as if impressed. That bought him a sliver of pity, despite herself. Song’s family had been more influential than wealthy before the Dimming – generations of service even in the higher reaches of the bureaucracy brought respect but not overflowing coffers, unless you were corrupt – but even in the early days of their exile they had been able to provide at least this much in fare to their own.

“So about six coppers a head for every meal,” Abrascal said. “If we lean on fish and soup.”

“That sounds accurate, yes,” Song said.

He grimaced.

“The same meal you’re describing would cost somewhere between nine and twelve radizes, in Sacromonte,” the thief said. “And there is no way that food on this nowhere island should cost less, even if there is some kind of hidden colony tucked away somewhere.”  

And there she must agree again. The prices per pound were close to the bargain a buyer might get for acquiring a large bulk at once, or perhaps buying straight from the farm. Unless the meat and greens were quite literally dirt cheap, the shops could not be making a profit off the sale. Which meant profit was not the point of having those shops there.

A concerning thought.

“On our end, at least, the costs seem reasonable,” Song said. “At twelve radizes a head for every day, over a month the price comes to-”

Thirty-four copper radizes to a silver arbol, three arboles to a golden rama. That would come to – three hundred and thirty-six coppers a week, one thousand three hundred and forty-four a month. A little under thirty-seven silvers and a half, meaning…

“- around twelve ramas and an arbol every month,” she finished. “I would not wager it a coincidence that is half of the twenty-five gold our brigade receives monthly.”

Abrascal blinked at her.

“When did you have time work that out?”

Song’s brow creased.

“You just heard me,” she said.

“Did you-” he began, glancing down at her list for something before shaking his head. “Never mind.”

The thief cleared his throat.

“We haven’t got the prices for supplies yet but I suppose it doesn’t matter if we are not yet sure what we actually need,” he said.

“I think it prudent to assume another seven gold and two silvers,” Song said. “Between ink, paper, clothes and blackpowder the lot might end up rather costly.”

And it brought the costs at an orderly twenty ramas out of twenty-five, a round number satisfying to the mind.

“That’s five gold loose,” Abrascal said. “Toss a rama our way each in private funds, then stash the last away for a rainy day and that is still quite the generous allowance for the Watch to give us.”

“So long as the prices stay the same,” Song warned. “Should they rise…”

It would eat into everything else, and worse.

“That is the part that trips me,” Abrascal admitted. “The current prices are apt to ruin the business but the shops don’t seem Watch-owned. Why would the owners empty their pockets for our sake? It smells like a racket, but I cannot see the point of it.”

“The point could be to provide us food at an affordable price,” Song said.

“Then why involve shopkeepers at all?” he asked. “Why not have some Watch quartermaster run the whole affair instead?”

That was, Song would admit, a reasonable question to ask. It seemed unnecessarily complicated, something the Watch was usually decent at avoiding. Tristan drummed his fingers against the table.

“Last night, the cooks and servants at that fancy evening were not part of the Watch,” he said. “They were tradesmen, here at its sufferance.”

Song nodded.

“It is the same on Regnant Avenue,” she said. “I saw a watchman buy from one of the butchers when first exploring the streets and he paid as anyone would.”

The man grimaced.

“All right, so the obvious play is letting the shops raise prices so everyone gets squeezed,” Abrascal said. “I just don’t see the point.”

“Why not have higher prices from the start, you mean,” Song said.

He nodded.

“Poor planners might find themselves lacking funds,” she suggested.

“Would anyone that foolish make the cut for Scholomance?” he asked.

Again, a fair point. Song had yet to ascertain the skills of her fellow captains but it would be a mistake to assume incompetence.

“Whatever the game,” he continued, “we should stock up on food that’ll keep.”

It was a step in the right direction, but not far enough.

“We need to learn how to fish,” Song said. “Or find a place where we might hunt. That might be the very reason two days a week are potentially left to us.”

The Sacromontan hummed in approval.

“Well, we have a garden,” he said. “Good black earth, not that I know much of gardening. We could buy seeds and plant them so we won’t have to rely on the greenmongers.”

Clever, that. She nodded.

“Herbs and vegetables,” Song mused. “A fruit-bearing tree would take too long to grow to be useful, I fear.”

“Berry bushes can grow quickly,” he disagreed. “But better to stick with vegetables, yes. I believe saw a bag of carrot seeds in one of the shops.”

The Tianxi glanced down at her papers, musing a new list involving seeds, and found there was little room left for one. She should have brought more paper. It was unfortunate that only so much of it that could be carried on you easily in a Watch uniform. Before she could begin debating whether or not to set out to obtain more, movement at the entrance of the eating hall caught her eye. Given that they were late for the morning meal and too early for the evening one, she had a guess as to who it might be.

As expected, it was Maryam and Angharad.

The former wore a hooded cloak Song was going to have to discreetly inquire had been stolen from who, given the distinctive blue and yellow embroidery, while the latter had a new saber belted at her hip. Much richer work than the standard-issue Watch blade she’d been using since the Dominion, but the sword was not what caught her eye: both women were carrying a pair of muskets whose make she did not recognize.

Song saw in fine detail so long as she could see at all, a consequence of her contract’s nature – though her experiments had established that the guiding nature of the ability was conceptual instead of physical, so ‘sight’ was not entirely correct – and the look of those flintlocks was not artisanal. These were workshop-built. Interesting, given that the barrel was overlong for a musket. Were these like her Zhangshou, built for sharpshooters?

Maryam put the two guns she had been carrying on the table and sat by Tristan, stealing his cup of water without even bothering with a greeting first. He let that pass without comment, looking amused, and a heartbeat later Angharad set down the other two muskets on the pile before joining Song’s side of the table.

Now was not the time to ask about these, but most definitely would.

“There were messages in front,” Angharad told her, reaching inside her pocket. “From our covenants, unless I am greatly mistaken. I took the liberty of bringing yours.”

She passed Song a folded paper sealed in wax, the hand-and-bolts of the Academy clearly visible.

“My thanks,” she said, and broke it open.

The contents were short and to the point, almost brusque. A time and a place – three in the afternoon, the OId Playhouse – as well as a dress code. She was to come in her regular uniform and armed. Song turned, cocking an eyebrow at Angharad.

“Maryam and I also received one,” the Pereduri said.

“Akelarre lessons will be in the chapterhouse, unsurprisingly,” Maryam contributed.

“I do not know where the training will take place for the Skiritai,” Angharad said, “but it is at the front gates of Scholomance we are summoned to. Fully armed.”

“The Old Playhouse for us, armed as well,” Song offered, then flicked a glance at Abrascal.

“I haven’t received summons,” he said. “Unless Maryam has mine?”

She shook her hand. The thief snorted.

“I suppose it would have been too easy for the Krypteia to just tell me what it wants,” Abrascal said. “I’ll have to find my own way without summons, I think.”

Song slowly nodded.

“I could ask other captains about it, should you fail to find a trail,” she offered.

He inclined his head in thanks. Good. It had been a concern he might be too proud to accept. Song’s attention returned to the cabal at large.

“We have investigated our funds and a variety of prices,” she said. “Meanwhile, word was sent to Captain Wen as to our choices of electives.”

A pause.

“Now we must agree on what will be bought and how we will divide the work of obtaining everything before we return to the cottage,” she said, eyeing the other three.

Already there had been a casualty: Angharad had preemptively become bored by the matter. She was feigning attention, but not very well. And while Maryam seemed attentive for now, Song suspected most of the interest would be withdrawn when it was established what her private funds consisted of. The Triglau was tight-lipped about her origins, but Song had noticed in her a tendency to expect she would be provided for most common in those born to means.

It was rather irritating that the only other soul at the table with any financial acumen was an avowed thief.  Well, perhaps Song could add a little something to keep the attention of the miscreants.

“After which we will be discussing this afternoon’s robbery,” Song casually said.

And fancy that, now she had their full attention and all it had taken was crime.

—

The hood did its work.

Maryam looked suspicious going around with it pulled down, but it still drew fewer stares than her skin had. Suspicious was not that uncommon, in a place like Tolomontera, and she found it a relief. Her time on the Dominion had let her forget the invisible weight following her everywhere – oh, sometimes there had been stares but were too exhausted or worried to take issue with her paleness. But here on Tolomontera, where blackcloaks patrolled and students wandered around, she could hardly turn a street corner without someone gawking.

Or glaring.

The smithy’s front shop – called Brillante, if the sign hung above the door was to be believed – was run by an older woman of Lierganen looks, gray-haired and heavyset. Tristan haggled with her in Antigua so fast and so peppered with jargon she could hardly follow, though it appeared to involve the price of a pair of iron pans leading to either the Thirteen Brigade living in the streets and dying of the plague or the old woman being divorced by her wife while their grandchildren were sold as slaves to pay gambling debts.

By the time Tristan paid both seemed pleased, and the old woman threw in a tin ladle to encourage them coming back. Maryam remained profoundly unsure whether or not they’d been gouged.

“The old bastard at the Petstik will rob you on anything that has iron in it,” the old woman warned them. “Izcalli can’t work anything but noble metals properly anyway, everyone knows that.”

“I will heed your advice, tia,” Tristan assured her.

She rolled her eyes at him.

“Out, you pest,” she said, shooing him out. “I’ll need to trick at least two fools to make up for your taking advantage of me.”

Maryam trailed after him, openly amused, as he put away the pans in the bag. Song had left them with a list, written in her neat looping handwriting, and by the time Tristan looked up she had found the next items.

“We need knives,” she told him. “At least two. Should we head back in?”

He shook his head.

“Let’s go see the old bastard at the Petstik,” Tristan mused. “Might be he cuts us a price if he hears what the fine ladies of the Brillante have been saying about him.”

“You sound like you enjoy this,” she noted.

“I have never spent so much coin in a single day,” he admitted. “It feels like a fever dream.”

Maryam hummed. Neither had she, but that was because she’d hardly ever had to pay for anything. Her father had fed and clothed her as a girl, sometimes bought her trinkets, and Mother’s warbands had shared everything. There was no spare coin there, or sometimes any coin at all.

“Best not get used to it,” she said. “Between the clothes, supplies and arms we are like as not to be thin on coin by the end of the month.”

The dark-haired man’s face tightened. He cared little for most of his belongings, she knew, but the loss of Yong’s pistol had stung. Like as not he would begin looking for where the Ninth might have stashed their possessions, which she wished him luck on. Maryam had learned to travel light and always keep what she could not afford to lose on her, but she’d liked her clothes. They were comfortable and fitted to her frame. The pair cut out of Regnant Avenue and through an alley, heading north towards where they’d seen the other smithy earlier.

“I won some coin off the Forty-Ninth,” Tristan idly said. “If you need anything that will not get a nod from Song, tell me.”

She squinted at him.

“Are you telling me,” Maryam said, “that we are going to be robbing these poor souls twice?”

She had been pleased to hear of the scheme, even more so for the way it visibly made Tredegar uncomfortable.

“It took only a few silvers,” Tristan easily replied. “We can call it reparations for trying to ambush me, if you like.”

She snorted.

“I will mention it should there be pressing need,” Maryam said. “Still, it is amusing that you and Tredegar would be the ones with coin to spare, out of the four of us.””

He cocked a questioning eyebrow.

“She got a pouch of gold from her uncle, along the saber and the rifles,” she explained.

And there her steps stuttered.

Maryam had not heard it laid out so plainly before. It had not truly sunk in, how the rest of them made do with what they could steal or scrabble for while Angharad Tredegar had been handed treasures and a pile of gold without so much as lifting a finger for it. Simply by virtue of who she was.

And Maryam had hardly even noticed, because the Malani had looked sad.

“Maryam?”

She looked down at her hands, found the fingers clenched into fists. She’d been had. Maryam had known better and still been had. That was how insidious they were. A hand on her arm dragged her out of her anger to find Tristan frowning at her.

“What happened?”

“She grew fragile looking at her new expensive saber, whining of the old one being a gift from her father,” Maryam bit out. “And like a fool, I bought it.”

Tredegar had been literally pocketing gold as it happened and still she’d fallen for it. The shame burned, enough she felt like walking away – only she did not know where they would be headed. The pair was standing by a condemned house, the door walled in with bricks but the front steps still standing, and Maryam had not been paying much attention to their path.

“Her family was murdered mere months ago,” he said. “I do not believe that grief feigned.”

“So we all have to pretend she does no wrong,” she harshly replied, “because she is grieving and polite and she means well?”

“Well-meaning doesn’t come into it,” Tristan said. “The nicest tick still sucks blood, Maryam. Tredegar’s an exceptional swordswoman, but she had the chance to become that only because her family squeezed the blood out of a hundred other families.”

He shrugged.

“There might have been talents greater than hers plowing the fields of Llanw Hall, cleaning her kitchen or washing her sheets. The world will never know, because she was born with the right surname and they were not.”

“But you like her,” Maryam accused.

“I have forgiven worse of people I needed less,” Tristan frankly replied. “I’ll not forget what she is, but what gain is there in pillorying her for it? It won’t take back the name or squeeze her back into her mother’s womb.”

You sound like my father, she thought. It was not a compliment. Mother might have been half-mad with blood and rage, at the end, but she had been right about everything. That they hadn’t listened to her was why Volcesta was now called Ifanje on maps and Malan’s ram-horn banner flew over her childhood home.

“That’s how they get away with it, Tristan,” she harshly said. “They come to you charming and generous, until their foot is on the door and then they begin squeezing you out. Small things, they ask, and you’re always talking with a reasonable man – it’s another Malani who wants to raise tariffs, who raided that town or seized that mine. You just need to meet them halfway, and isn’t the golden peace worth a small trifle?”

She leaned in.

“Then you take a step back, they take a step forward and before you know they’re sitting in your house,” Maryam said. “Eating your food, drinking your wine, until they do away with even that and call it their house.”

Gray eyes considered her, and she already knew how it would end. Mother had told them how it would end, that pack of kings grown fat on trinkets and trade, and they had turned on her for it. Vranasestra, they’d called her. Crow-sister, mouth of ill omens. Tristan was cleverer than they’d been, but-

“All right,” he said. “If you’re sure, we kill her.”

Maryam blinked, looking at his face for any trace of a lie.

“It will have to be poison,” Tristan continued. “Something slow acting, dosed over several days – we can blame the cottage for it, maybe plant something sinister-looking in her room and claim it was a hidden curse.”

She licked her lips.

“You are serious,” Maryam said.

He shrugged.

“You have yet to steer me wrong,” Tristan said. “If it is your honest belief she needs to go, she goes.”

Maryam swallowed. Either he meant every word or he was a much better liar than she had thought. She let herself consider it for a moment – once Tredegar was gone they would have to recruit a fourth, but it should not be impossible. Glassy eyes, stiff limbs. Worst come to worst they could grab someone from a team of spares as a temporary helper until they found a better fit. That full face gone gaunt, feverish. It would be easier to make peace with the Ninth and… Maryam bit her lip and cursed, looking away.

Much as she wanted to think only on the consequences, the outcomes, that was not where her mind kept leading her. It would be murder to kill Tredegar now. Simple murder. There was no getting around that.

Feeling lost, Maryam stumbled back. She caught herself before Tristan’s hand could grab her elbow, gently lowering her to sit on the edge of the stairs. Her limbs were shaking, weakness haunting her. He sat down by her, close without touching, and spoke not a word. Her voice was shaky as her fingers when it came out, feeling like it belonged to another woman.

“They hunted me, you know,” she said. “An entire company. Hounds and men chasing me for half a month through the wetlands.”

Her nails bit into her palm.

“They would have caught me, if I hadn’t run into Captain Totec,” she said. “They were soclose, just hours behind. If the rain hadn’t swept the ford and forced me to go south, if I’d not used the Craft where the blackcloaks could see me, I’d be…”

She swallowed.

“I don’t know,” Maryam said. “Dead or a slave. I’m only here because I got lucky, Tristan.”

She passed a hand through her hair.

“How do you forgive that?” she quietly asked. “Coming so close.”

“You don’t.”

She found him gazing ahead, eyes fixed on the road. The thief hesitated.

“After my mother died,” Tristan said, “I had to flee. Had a coterie after me. Just thugs, really, but they had the run of the neighborhood and the landlord an in with them. But they knew the streets well, all the hidey holes. They found me twice on the first day and I had to run through the night, getting not a wink of sleep.”

He smiled bitterly.

“Then I found this attic in an abandoned house behind a tanner,” Tristan said. “Perfect place – you could only get there by the tanner’s roof and the stink kept everyone away. Only when I crawled in there, I found there was already someone inside.”

Maryam watched, saw how his face tightened.

“A boy, sound asleep,” he said. “Just a year or two older than me but bigger. Stronger. I knew he’d beat me if it came to a fight.”

“It might not have come to that,” she said.

“No,” Tristan softly agreed. “He must have been on the run too, to end up there. Might be we could have helped each other, shared the place. There was enough room.”

He paused.

“Or maybe he would have turned me in to the coterie for a few coppers.”

She bit her lip, put himself in his boots. About to collapse, alone and afraid. She knew how that story ended.

“I couldn’t take the risk, Maryam,” Tristan said. “So I loosened one of the tiles from the roof and I beat him to death with it.”

The gray-eyed man kept staring ahead.

“He didn’t die from the first blow,” Tristan said, “and there was nothing clean about what followed. I slept, Maryam, with his corpse three feet away from me and blood under my fingernails.”

“And you regret it?” she asked.

“I’m not sure,” he admitted. “I was cornered, so I fought. There can be no sin in that. The boy I was, he made the only choice he could.”

His gaze moved to hers, holding it.

“But I’m not that boy anymore,” Tristan said. “I made sure of that, Maryam, so that one day I would have a better choice than trust or the tile.”

And she felt like lashing out, for what went unspoken behind the tale, only every time she felt like raising her hand or her voice at him she was stopped by a single, simple truth: if she asked him to, Tristan would murder Angharad Tredegar. No hesitation, no questions asked. He would just do it, was likely already considering how to.

Maryam was not sure how to get into a fight with that.

“I don’t trust her,” she said, hesitating. “I can’t. She’s… she doesn’t see anything wrong with what they do, the Malani. Not really. She dislikes the uglier parts, but she doesn’t care about the rest.”

“So don’t trust her,” Tristan shrugged.

She looked away.

“Song asked me to make nice with her.”

“I expect she would settle for fewer barbs,” he noted.

“So I’m to just let everything go,” Maryam bitterly replied.

He hummed, as if considering her words.

“You don’t act like you’re her equal, you know,” Tristan finally said.

Blue eyes turned to glare.

“Careful now.”

“You don’t,” he said. “You’re not fighting her, not really. When she steps on your toes you prick her, but that’s… resigned? It’s not a fight, it’s ceding the ground. If you called her impolite, faced her like an equal, she might bend. But you don’t. The barbs are funny, sure, and probably scratch an itch. But they don’t move the needle.”

“It is not my responsibility to teach Angharad Tredegar her wrongs,” Maryam flatly said.

“I don’t care if you do,” Tristan said. “I care that you act like there’s no winning an argument with her. Like I would – Manes, even Songwould – be on her side just because she’s polite and good at stabbing people. You’re not less than her, Maryam. You’re allowed to tell her to fuck off without needing to hide it.”

“You don’t,” she said.

“I don’t care enough about her opinions to be offended by them,” he honestly replied.

That startled a laugh out of her. They sat there in silence and Maryam closed her eyes, letting the tension bleed out of her. After a moment she leaned to the side, her head on his shoulder. He stiffened, for a moment, then loosened and even slipped an arm around her shoulder.

“I feel like a nap,” she muttered, “and we’ve barely even begun the day.”

“Ah, but I know what will you cheer you up,” Tristan said.

“What’s that?”

“Song made the mistake of leaving us in charge of buying the bedding, so we can buy Tredegar the very ugliest sheets in the shop and then watch her force herself to politely thank us for them later.”

He was right, Maryam mused. That did cheer her up.

—

Earlier that morning it had taken Song twenty minutes of interrogation to be satisfied, and to Abrascal’s honor he had not seemed irritated by the questions.

First came the acquisition of the necessary materials: a sponge, powder and a binding cloth. Nine coppers for the lot, it turned out. Song bound her breasts tightly, allowed Abrascal to fake stubble on her face with the sponge and powder then received Angharad’s help in putting up her hair in a Sanxing topknot: the knot unadorned with loose hair to the side. After that came the details.

Did they have a name?

Yes, that of Captain Tengfei Pan.

Did they have a brigade plague?

Yes, Tristan had seized one from his ambushers last night.

So the required essentials were in hand, leaving only questions. Song might now be able to pass as a man so long as she was careful with her voice, but what of her eyes? Their silver tint was distinctive, apt to unmask her.

“We saw the list they use when you took coin from our vault,” the thief pointed out. “It has names but no descriptions.”

True, but the silver of them remained recognizable and she had been seen there earlier today. Two silver-eyed Tianxi visiting the same day was sure to draw suspicion. How many of them could there be on Tolomontera?

“So we wait until the afternoon,” the thief said. “When the morning shift is gone and no one who saw you is still present.”

Feasible, she admitted. What, then, if the Forty-Ninth Brigade came to withdraw funds while she was present? It was unlikely but not impossible.

“The rest of us lay an ambush in the street,” the thief proposed. “We can fire one of those rifles their way to drive them off.”

What if they returned with allies, reinforcements?

“You should be able to hear a shot from inside,” the thief said. “If you do, hurry or retreat as you see fit.”

And on and on they had gone, until Song exhausted the worst outcomes her mind could muster and was yet satisfied with the Thirteenth Brigade’s ability to extract itself from the situation should the situation turn on them. It had been… oddly satisfying, planning what was in practice very much a crime. Not by the rules of Tolomontera, perhaps, but certainly by the world’s.

It was with a straight back and little uncertainty that ‘Captain Tengfei Pan’ entered the brigade vaults, ushered in by the guards.

Advancing unhurriedly past the antechamber and into the main hall, Song chose among the four desks the one opposite from the one she had last visited. The clerks inside were not the same as before, and neither were the guards in front, so it was likely unnecessary. She still did it.

“Plaque,” the bored young Lierganen at the desk instructed.

He had a half-eaten pastry on the corner of the desk and kept batting a fly off it. She provided the Forty-Ninth’s pilfered silver seal and received it back after a moment.

“How much is left in the vault?” Song asked, deepening her voice.

The clerk stuck out his tongue, paging through his ledger, then let out a little noise as he found the line he was looking for.

“Twelve ramas, two arboles and one radiz,” he replied.

Song kept her face calm, her heartbeat steady.

“I will withdraw everything,” she said.

The clerk did not answer. For a cold moment Song thought she had been caught, her voice or eyes caught on to, but it was not that.

Barely an inch above the pastry on the man’s desk, the fly was trapped as if the air around it had turned into amber. The Tianxi breathed in sharply, the sound of it deafening in the sudden and oppressive silence of the room. She pushed back her chair, rising to her feet, and turned to see a world gone still. One of the guards was adjusting his belt, a clerk had stopped while licking her thumb to turn a page.

“No,” Song cursed. “Already?”

It had only been four months, she’d thought she would have longer before… Her jaw clenched as she looked around. There was no one in the great hall but her and the frozen watchmen. Did she need to leave, pass through the gates and go outside into Tolomontera?

“You always miss what’s under your nose. The cost of turning it up so often.”

The voice was coming from besides the desk. And she could smell it now, the smell of wine and dirty clothes.

“You,” Song hissed, taking a step to the side.

And there he was.

The god was sprawled on the floor, back against the wood, and drinking from a gourd of plum wine as his pilgrim’s staff lay on the frozen clerk’s lap. His faded red robes were messy, tied only loosely at the waist, and he was barefoot. Infuriatingly enough he had sandals, but they hung off a rope tied to the staff and Song had never once seen him wear them. His robes and beard were stained with wine and meat juice, his hair matted and unkempt. Luren flashed a broad grin, then took a long drink from his gourd and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand  afterwards, sighting in satisfaction.

He was her god, the granter of her contract, and Song despised him from the bottom of her heart.

“Do you know this?” Luren asked.

Her fists clenched. Always he asked this and always the words were meaningless.

“I won’t,” Song bit out. “Because you are a profligate liar who invents his stories in the moment.”

“Lies are better than truth,” the god said. “Truth is lazy.”

She grit her teeth. To say this was to insult their very contract, since she had asked to – Song smoothed out the thought, the rising anger. He did it, she knew, to get a rise out of her. But she would not fall for it this time. Song had prepared herself, meditated on the matter. Her hand would remain on the chisel. The Tianxi forced herself into a formal bow.

“I thank you for your visit, teacher.”

There was a clap like thunder and Song flinched, eyes flicking up to see Luren had slapped his palm against the side of the desk.

“King Cathay once summoned me to his palace,” the god said. “He had great treasures but could not decide which was the greatest, so he called on the aid of this monk.”

King Cathay was a nothing-name, what old folk tales called the legendary king that had ruled before Cathay and given the land his name. There had been no such king, the figure as much a lie as the rest of the story.

“What would a monk know of treasures?” Song challenged.

Luren was openly pleased.

“What would you know of monks?” he asked.

She had a retort on the tip of her tongue – Song had read the entire six volumes of the Way of Ways purely to establish beyond argument that Luren was, in fact, a terrible monk – but she swallowed it. She could not let herself be drawn into that. The god delighted in pointless, circular arguments and would drag them both into a pit of futility if she let him. Song bowed again.

“I thank you for your insight, teacher,” she angrily lied.

This time she was ready for him to slap the desk when she took her eyes off him, pushing down the flinch at the thunderous sound.

“King Cathay presented me three treasures,” Luren told her. “The first was the purest, most luminous jade that ever was or will be. It had no match in Heaven or Earth and was capable of upending all the nations of men.”

The god did not sound disapproving of such upheaval.

“The second was a great war spear of death-steel, making one triumphant in all battles and capable of slaying gods like stray dogs,” Luren said. “One wielding it could conquer all the world, as he once had in his youth before he began making trouble for monks instead.”

Song twitched. In the old tales, King Cathay was never claimed to have conquered all of Vesper. It was not even a good lie.

“The third was King Cathay’s own wife, a friend of his childhood who knew his true soul and loved him truly despite his flaws and crown. That affection was true and could not be bought or swayed. He did not deserve her.”

If she could see his true soul, how could she not know the king was undeserving of her? Song’s fingers tightened.

“King Cathay sat across from this monk and smirked, for in his heart of hearts he played a trick. To his mind the greatest treasure was the crown set on his brow, for without it he was no longer king and possessed nothing at all.”

Song allowed herself a sliver of relief. They were soon to be done.

“So you chose the crown,” she said, helping the ending along.

The god laughed.

“Know this,” Luren said. “This monk slapped him across the face and said: there, I now hold the greatest treasure.”

Song twitched.

“Liar,” she said, finally unable to resist. “You would have been killed for that.”

“Yet here I am, so you are wrong,” the god happily said.

He took a swig from his jug, only he began laughing at the face she made halfway through the swallow and sprayed plum wine everywhere, staining his beard and clothes and the floor and…

“Would you stop-” she snarled.

No. Fuck. Again. Song breathed in, walked away with her hands on her head. She fought down the urge to strike at the wall. Every time. Every single time he got to her. It was like every detail about Luren was meant to drive her wild with anger – the sloppiness, the filth, the obvious lies and the nonsense lessons. Every iota of the god grated her sensibilities. She walked back, calmer but no less defeated for it.

“Thank you for your lesson, teacher,” she spoke through gritted teeth, bowing again.

“You learn nothing,” Luren dismissed. “Despite my many attempts.”

“You once told me to cut down trees until enlightenment followed,” she snarled back.

“And I notice you’ve stopped,” the god said, clicking his tongue disapprovingly.

Her finger clenched but no, he would not get her twice.

“What do you want from me?” Song asked.

“I thought it evident,” Luren said, squinting at her. “You should begin slapping kings.”

The drunken god eyed her with feigned worry.

“You were not this slow as a girl, Song.”

No, she had been worse. Fortunately, felling thirty-three trees with a dull handaxe at Luren’s sage instruction had cured her of it.

“You have told me your story,” she said. “Release me from this visitation.”

Dislocation, the common term was, but it was not the one Song had been raised to. Luren had brought her into himself, to torment her once more.

“Release yourself,” the god said.

“I cannot,” Song replied through gritted teeth. “That power is in your hands.”

“Because you leave it there,” Luren smiled.

Her fingers twitched, itching to punch that light out of his eyes, and in that very moment she understood. That was the point of his tale: King Cathay had the crown as his greatest treasure, but Luren had slapped him and so he possessed ‘a hand that can strike a king’. The greater treasure of the two.

So Song slapped the god, who took it with a thundering laugh.

The world around them began to crack, like glass fracturing in spiderwebs.

“See,” Luren said. “In your hands all along.”

“You are a liar,” Song said.

“Oh no,” the god grinned. “I’m much too lazy for that.”

Song’s fist clenched, and before she could reply-

“I will need you to sign for it,” the Lierganen clerk said. “And to see your plaque again.”

She was sitting in the chair again, freed of the visitation, and the watchman was frowning at her lack of answer. Song took in a shuddering breath, mastering herself enough to offer the silver seal again. And seeing the glint of it on light, she thought anew.

The Forty-Ninth would know they had been stolen from soon enough, she thought. They would ask questions of the watchmen, the patron seeing to it they received answers.

And since there was no hiding the silver of Song’s gaze, there would be no hiding the truth. The Forty-Ninth Brigade would only need ask around for a Tianxi with such eyes to know that who it was that had acted against them. Confrontation was inevitable.

And if the inevitable was on its way, why face it meekly?

“Apologies,” Song said. “I have changed my mind, I will not be taking everything.”

She paused.

“I have not thought to ask until now, but might I add something to the vault?”

The blackcloak clerk cocked an eyebrow.

“Only if it is no larger than a hand,” he said.

“It is not,” Song said.

He acceded carefully enough when she asked to borrow ink and paper. Minutes later, Song Ren walked out of the building leaving only two things in the vault of the Forty-Ninth Brigade.

The first was a single copper coin.

The second was a folded piece of paper bearing a short message: you may consider the truce offer withdrawn.  

# Chapter 12

Angharad woke to the smell of breakfast.

Tossing aside her sheets – where Tristan and Maryam had found such a profoundly ugly shade of brown, she had no idea – she pushed herself up. Though she had slept in a bedroll laid on the ground, it had been a decent enough night’s sleep. The Pereduri still looked forward to securing a proper bed and mattress for the bedroom she’d claimed, possibly paired with sheets that did not make her feel like wincing.

Getting up, she washed herself with a cloth and a pot of tepid well water before putting on her new combat uniform. There was no looking glass in the room, or indeed much of anything except dust and the bags she had set down yesterday, but there was one downstairs she would use to verify nothing was askew. Coming down the steps – they creaked under her feet – she found that Song and Maryam were already seated at the drawing room table, chatting quietly over plates and cups of tea.

Song nodded her way, Maryam instead shoveling in a mouthful of eggs and rashers and loudly chewing. The Izvorica had been unreadable since Angharad faltered before her yesterday, which left her unsure of her footing around the other woman.

“Tristan still sleeps?” Angharad asked, nodding back to Song.

Their captain shook her head.

“He woke first,” she said. “He’s out digging in the garden.”

Very industrious of him, Angharad thought approvingly. Yesterday there had been talk of planting herbs and vegetables in the yard so they might have a supply even should the goods in Port Allazei grow too expensive. A most prudent notion. While it had not happened in Angharad’s lifetime, she’d heard that Frangoch Heights – the lands to the east of Llanw Hall – had closed its roads to merchants in her grandmother’s day and the sharp rise in the price of lumber and iron had almost ruined House Tredegar.

Being at the mercy of one’s neighbors for necessities was a dangerous thing.

The noblewoman helped herself to a plate in the kitchen, learning the meal was Song’s work when she asked, and sat with the others to eat. Conversation was halting but amicable and though Angharad polished off her plate rather quickly there was no snide comment from Maryam following. Though her cheeks yet burned at the memory of how she had shamed herself blubbering out her grief to a stranger, she dared hoped that the continued silence might mean they had reached a truce of sorts.

It was encouraging that last night Maryam had specified to the others that she was not merely Triglau but Izvorica, implying they had not known before. It had thus been a true gesture for the pale-skinned woman to tell her that, not mere window-dressing.

When Angharad brought back her empty plate to the kitchen, she found Tristan was in the antechamber wiping his boots. The Sacromontan was faintly sweaty, his hands and knees caked in dirt, but at least he had only gone out in his shirt and trousers instead of dirtying a uniform.

“Morning,” he greeted her. “Is everyone done eating?”

“Good morning,” Angharad replied. “Song will soon be finished with her tea, I believe.”

The gray-eyed man grunted in acknowledgement.

“Then I best get changed,” he said.

Well, if he was headed that way already… Angharad cleared her throat.

“I bought a comb yesterday,” she said. “In case you were looking for one.”

Tristan’s lips twitched.

“If my hair is known to be messy, then when it is combed it can serve as a disguise,” he told her.

She did appreciate that he attempted not to lie, though given her familiarity with exact wording his efforts were very much transparent.

“My father once told me the trick to getting away with that is using a truth that sounds like a lie,” Angharad advised him. “That way the adversary chases an untruth that does not exist.”

He cocked his head to the side.

“Your father sounds like a wise man,” Tristan conceded.

It should not have made a difference, to hear the word in someone else’s mouth when she had just spoken it, but it did. Angharad was suddenly aching at his absence, and struggled to master herself.

“He was,” she finally replied, and left it at that.

And dead, sure to be, but the knowledge that there had been survivor from Llanw Hall threaded that grief with new uncertainty. Imandi Langa had told her a prisoner was taken by the men who had slain her family, but not who. A cousin, her uncle? A servant, more likely, but Angharad could not imagine those unknown soldiers thinking a servant of House Tredegar being worth much as a hostage.

Who would pay for their release with mother dead and Angharad herself disgraced? Unless they had known secrets of the house, and that was why they were kept alive. There had to be a reason House Tredegar had been struck at, for that slaughter had been carefully planned. But Angharad knew nothing, and the only answers at hand were in another woman’s grip – to be paid for, and dearly. And yet the urge to know was like an itch she could not scratch.

Within ten minutes they were all ready to leave, a merciful distraction from her thoughts. They were all armed, bearing the pistols Song had insisted they all acquire at the hip and their preferred arms besides. Angharad’s saber and their captain’s straight sword were no surprise, but the handaxe belted at Maryam’s side was. The Izvorica did not have the callouses of someone trained in wielding such a weapon, but there must have been a reason for her to pick it over more common blades.

Tristan bore a knife, but Angharad knew better than to think it his only one.

They crossed the garden and took the stairs down, first going down a series of convoluted passages and circling stairs – empty doors windows stared at them like unblinking eyes, every scrap of metal turned into rust-red strokes like blood spatter – before reaching the opening that Tristan had yesterday seen from the outside. It looked as if a courtyard had been carved a single saber’s blow, broken stacked rectangle-houses hanging open on both sides. Rusted metal wires, each large a fist, hung across the gap for some mysterious purpose and copper pipes peeked out like ribs.

It was not stairs they stepped onto down to the street but rubble, the stones large enough they served the purpose with little danger.

“If we are to remain here for several years it might be best to clear this out and put in proper stairs,” Angharad said.

She did not look forward to carrying mattress stuffing up this, or solid furniture for that matter. The Thirteenth was in a most dire need of chairs.

“We should first settle the cottage properly,” Song replied. “It needs a thorough cleaning and further furnishing.”

“Tredegar’s right,” Maryam said, shaking her head. “If it rains this all turns into a slippery death trap. We should look into putting up a rope rail, at least.”

Surprised, Angharad nodded her thanks for the support. The Izvorica curtly nodded back to. A pleasant turn, and perhaps a hopeful one.

Once they were out in Port Allazei they took to the streets eastwards so they might find Arsay Avenue, the road that led straight to Scholomance and was said to be regularly patrolled by the blackcloaks.

The Grand Orrery’s false stars cut a green swath this morning and it made it stand out all the more that the neighborhood around their new home were overgrown with trees and vines, like flowers grown on bones of stone. Twice Angharad caught sight of what looked like silhouettes watching them rooftops, but no one ever emerged. It took them only ten minutes to make it to Arsay Avenue, which they found quite busy.

Given the hour – it was now nearly six forty-five, according to Tristan’s watch – that was no surprise. According to the instructions Captain Wen had passed along, every student in Scholomance was meant to be in class by seven thirty.

A patrol of twelve armed watchmen was briskly marching down the avenue, but the others were all students. The Thirteenth drew eyes at having come out of ruins, but little more than that. They would not be the only ones indulging in shortcuts and detours. As they came onto the road they crossed paths with another cabal whose captain, a handsome Malani with carefully tended beard, came over to introduce himself with three companions.

“Captain Philani, Thirty-Eighth Brigade,” he said, offering up his hand.

“Captain Song, Thirteenth,” Song replied, taking it.

The man’s brow rose, perhaps in recognition, but the demeanor remained friendly. After a brief round of introductions, they agreed to move forward together.

“I am told the garrison made a deep sweep along the avenue last night to clear out the lemure nests, but beasts always creep back in,” Captain Phalani said. “There is safety in numbers.”

Certainly others believed the same, as Angharad glimpsed other groups trudging along the road that were too large to consist of a single cabal. As they set out she and Song ended up at the front with the captain, Tristan and Maryam instead keeping pace with the others.

“I have yet to see a lemure on the island,” Angharad admitted. “Though we are admittedly recent arrivals.”

“Shades are the most common,” he said. “But like the Malani breed, they flee groups and strike only at the weak or wounded. The real threats are the lycosi packs. The Ninth Brigade also spread word there is a briarid wandering along the western edge of Allazei, but it sounds easy enough to avoid.”

Angharad knew of the latter lemure, mostly by virtue of it looking striking on bestiary pages. Briarids were also called ‘hundred-handers’, both large and extremely territorial. The other name, however, she was unfamiliar with.

“Lycosi?” she asked.

“Wolf-like creatures capable of some shapeshifting if they have recently partaken of meat,” Song contributed.

The other captain nodded.

“One is hardly a threat to a trained soldier,” Captain Phalani expounded, “but they move in packs and are known to use cunning stratagems.”

Conversation continued pleasantly as they walked down Arsay Avenue, though after ten minutes or so they were forced to halt. There was some sort of road blockage from a fallen house, a crowd of students milling around the rubble. Both the Thirteenth and the Thirty-Eighth approached in curiosity, finding the reason for such interest – there was a wounded. A tanned girl had a mangled leg, perhaps broken by falling rubble, and a handful of students were seeing to her wound.

Around her were a pair of bloodied corpses, but they belonged to lemures and not men: harpies, feathered monsters with fearsome talons and some measure of intelligence. Some sort of ambush must have taken place here, Angharad thought. A disconcerting prospect, given that they would need to pass through here five mornings out of seven.

Students were beginning to circle around the collapse, though some enterprising soul instead made their way through the rubble-strewn avenue. That was half the reason for the crowd, as the easiest way across was somewhat narrow and an informal line had formed. They parted ways with Captain Phalani there, as he intended to cross the rubble while Song decided they would be going around instead. They backtracked for a bit then cut west, through a cracked stone courtyard.

There, however, surprise struck.

“Take a tracing, then,” Ferranda Villazur exasperatedly said. “It isn’t going anywhere.”

On the other side of the courtyard, beneath a pair of broken columns, the Thirty-First Brigade was inspecting some kind of mechanism. Zenzele was leaning against one of the columns, hat pulled down and looking half-asleep, while Ferranda was addressing a kneeling Tianxi that Angharad could only see the back of. Their designated lookout, however, did not miss the Thirteenth’s arrival.

“Well, well, well,” Shalini Goel grinned, pushing off the wall. “Look what the cat dragged in.”

“I see we are too late,” Song solemnly replied. “The Someshwar’s already invaded.”

“We’ve come for your hats and women,” Shalini agreed.

She turned to Angharad, wiggling her eyebrows, and the Pereduri could not help but snort.

“It is good to see you as well, Shalini,” she said, offering her arm to clasp.

The short, curvy gunslinger took it. To Angharad’s surprise she was even drawn in for a quick embrace, just as quickly released as the Someshwari went off to greet the others. Meanwhile Zenzele had come to join the reuinion, and just as he traded greeting with Angharad they were joined by the last two of his brigade. Ferranda she was familiar with, naturally, but the fourth was a new face.

“Angharad, if I might introduce you to our fellow cabalist Rong Ma,” Lady Ferranda said.

The Tianxi was barely taller than Shalini, dark of eye and with short black hair combed to the side. With those slender eyebrows and delicate features, Angharad was honestly unsure if she was looking at a man or woman – or other, for that matter.

“Angharad Tredegar,” she said, offering her hand.

“Please, call me Rong,” the Tianxi replied shaking it.

The voice was soft and ambiguous, which did nothing to settle the matter. Angharad was going to have to ask.

“Rong is an Umuthi Society recommendation,” Ferranda said. “They’re headed for the Clockwork Cathedral track.”

Ah, there it was. Angharad nodded her thanks at Ferranda for saving her the awkwardness of asking a stranger their gender, getting a smile back.

“I must confess I do not know of this Cathedral,” she said.

“It is an internal distinction of the society,” Rong told her. “Tinkers of the Clockwork Cathedral concern themselves with entirely mechanical devices, whole those of the Deuteronomicon study mainly aetheric machinery.”

They cleared their throat.

“I hope you do not find me too forward to asking, but are you truly related to Captain Osian Tredegar?”

Angharad paused, taken aback.

“He is my uncle,” she replied. “How do you know of him?”

“He is a rising name in the Clockwork Cathedral,” Rong told her. “If not for the opportunity to attend Scholomance, I might well have attempted to enter his workshop as journeyman.”

One of these days, she thought, she was going to cease being surprised by the sheer depths of things she did not know about her uncle Osian. Yet today was not that day, evidently.

“He had sent word he will be passing by the island soon,” Angharad said. “I could make introductions, if you would like.”

Rong’s eyes widened.

“That would be very kind of you,” they happily said.

That set a rather friendly tone which extended into a round of introductions between the cabals, faltering only when the Tianxi was introduced to Song. The hand they had been about to offer went down, as if fearing to be burned by the touch, and the face of Angharad’s captain tightened. To their honor, Rong grasped the rudeness of the act.

“Apologies,” they said. “But everyone knows touching a Ren is…”

“Bad luck,” Song evenly said. “So I have heard. It is no matter.”

Angharad’s gaze cooled as she stared at the other Tianxi, who looked somewhat abashed but not in any way inclined to take back the snub. Perhaps her uncle’s schedule would not allow for an introduction, after all. Ferranda pushed through the tenseness with forced cheer, suggesting they walk to Scholomance together, and Song agreed.  The mood had somewhat soured, but thankfully the walk to the outskirts of the school grounds was a mere few minutes long after they cut back east and returned to Arsay Avenue past the rubble.

Scholomance’s silhouette grew taller and taller, like a giant staring down, and around them ruins grew sparser and sparser until they were flanked by little more than fields of grass. Walking in the hulking school’s shadow, they approached the school through a wide paved yard. The span of Scholomance’s grounds was traced by a shallow canal long gone dry, Angharad saw, and there were but two stone bridges across it.

Before each bridge a tall bronze statue, most of them lost to time, and near them students were lining up to wait. Beneath the statues were pairs of blackcloaks with ledgers and equipment, which were handing the students something Angharad could not make out before sending them on their way. The Thirty-First picked one line and the Thirteenth another, bringing their common road to an end.

The parting was polite, but noticeably cooler than the first greetings had been. To Maryam’s honor, she seemed even more miffed by Rong Ma’s lack of etiquette than Angharad herself was. As they made to stand in line the noblewoman saw there were only two cabals ahead of them, but the process seemed slow-going. Angharad found her gaze drifting past the blackcloaks and students onto the school itself, at last getting a closer look.

Scholomance, she found, was beautiful.

She had not expected that. From a distance the school had seemed like a looming specter, dark and dangerous, and it was certainly that – but it was also poignantly beautiful. The heart of it was a cathedral of pale gray stone, but nothing like any she had seen before. At its summit of it stood a great dome made of flashing brass bones set in green tiles, large as small town, and from there the school unfolded like a madman’s bewitching dream.

Flanking the front gates were twin towers carved of stone so fine it looked like lace, but it was the front facade that had hundreds staring: it was made entirely of stained glass. Even the gates themselves, wide open as they were. Behind that splendor lurked ghostly lights moved by some unseen mechanism, their course making it seem as if the colors of the facade were themselves alive.

To the sides lesser halls spread out, their roofs set with the same green tiles with veins of bronze and strangely wide – some led into towers, of which there were many, and which were connected by a veritable maze of arched walkways hundreds of feet above the ground. Far to the east Angharad glimpsed a great sphere of glass touched with wrought iron balconies, the inside filled with what appeared an ocean of library stacks. To the west she made out the silhouette of a tortured spire covered in vines, roofless for the pale stairs spiraling upwards into nothing.

Everywhere Angharad looked there was something to see: a bronze statue tucked away between shadows, a stream of red flowers grown out of cracks in the walls or a path between two rooftops made entirely out of crystal chandeliers hanging from an archway above. The last of these was so strange that Angharad sought it out again, but no matter how much she looked she could not find it. Had she imagined it, her mind moved to confusion by the surfeit of wonders?

“That place,” Maryam Khaimov said, “is a cauldron of Gloam. Trust nothing you see.”

Angharad stiffened.

“These are illusions?”

Was some spirit inside her mind?

“Oh no,” the Izvorica grimly said. “We’re not that lucky. Everything is real – so long as our eyes are on it, as it bears the weight of observation. The moment it’s not, it will move as it wills.”

“Are you saying that school is alive?” Angharad asked.

“Something is,” Maryam hedged.

“It is a god. There is a god in there.”

They both turned towards Song, who even as she spoke had never taken her eyes off Scholomance.

“I cannot see its body, but I see its… tendrils, for lack of better term. It is everywhere in the school, like a vine grown inside a corpse and bursting out of the flesh.”

“Well, at least I no longer feel hungry,” Tristan muttered. “What do we need to watch out for, Song?”

The Tianxi grimaced.

“I don’t know,” she admitted. “I have never seen anything like it, not even on the Dominion. It’s so deep I’m not sure if it infested Scholomance or if it is Scholomance. I can warn you if we approach danger, but nothing more than that. It moves.”

The noblewoman swallowed. That was… unsettling to hear. Would they truly be taking their classes inside the belly of the beast? Yet the conversation was not to continue, for while they spoke the line had advanced enough that they were moments away from being called on, their pair of watchmen by the broken statue – a head and arm were gone – shouting for them to approach. Song took the lead in doing so, Angharad close behind, and a mustachioed man bade them to stop when he judged them close enough.

“Brigade?” he asked.

“Thirteenth,” Song replied.

“All of you?”

Angharad nodded when his gaze found her, as did the others in turn. The watchman glanced at his partner, who put her hand in an old leather hat and after a heartbeat pulled out a pebble painted yellow.

“That’s four for yellow,” she said. “I’ll mark it down.”

Even as the watchwoman took  up a ledger tucked away behind the statue’s foot and went reaching for an inkwell, the other blackcloak picked up a leather bag and pulled from it a handful of yellow ribbons. He counted four, shoved the rest back into the bag then passed them to Song – who in turn passed them out the rest of the cabal.

“Around your wrist,” the watchman instructed

Angharad cleared her throat while she attached it as bid.

“Might I ask,” she said, “the meaning of the color?”

“Yellow,” the watchman flatly replied. “The fuck do you think it’s supposed to mean, girl?”

Angharad’s lips thinned.

“Four hundred students are too many for a single teacher,” the watchwoman informed them without looking up from the ledger. “You are to be split in four groups of a hundred, which are differentiated by color.”

The man snorted disdainfully.

“Once you cross the bridge there will be officers bearing colored flags,” he said. “Head to the one in your color and they’ll sort you out for class.”

“Thank you,” Song replied, inclining her head.

“Don’t hold up the line,” the watchman grunted back.

Angharad spared him a dark look as they walked past him, which he failed to notice entirely as the pair began the same sequence for the cabal that had been waiting behind the Thirteenth. The four of them crossed the bridge, finding on the other side what they had been told. Spread out across the paved plaza were four officers under colored banners – red, blue, green and yellow.

Their man was the leftmost, an Aztlan in his late twenties, and to Angharad’s distaste he appeared quite disreputable. Not only had he brought a folding chair to sit on, propping up the flag against his shoulder instead of holding it up, but he was also smoking a pipe. It was worse when she approached and got a proper look. Between the stubble, the unkempt long hair in a ponytail – with the sides shaved – and the glasses slightly askew, the man looked more a brigand than a blackcloak. Even his uniform was sloppy, creased while his coat was meant for a man twice his size.

He waved when he noticed them, pulling at his pipe. Brown eyes moved from one to another, then he chuckled and blew out a perfect circle of smoke.

“Silver eyes,” he listed. “A mirror-dancer and the only paleskin on Tolomontera. Despite the absent tricorn, you must be the Thirteenth Brigade.”

Angharad blinked, taken aback. Had their reputation even reached the local garrison?

“We are,” Song confirmed. “A pleasure to meet you…”

“Professor Tenoch Sasan,” the man said. “By the color of your ribbon, it appears I will be teaching you Saga.”

A professor? But he looked so… Perhaps it was some Izcalli fashion, Angharad desperately thought, and it only looked like he couldn’t bother to dress presentably. At her side, Tristan let out a noise.

“Friend of Wen’s, are you sir?” he asked.

Professor Tenoch laughed.

“Sharp boy,” he praised. “What gave it away?”

“I’ve barely worn the tricorn on the island,” Tristan said. “That and Captain Wen is from the historian track of the Arthashastra Society, which fits the subject you teach.”

Angharad had not even known Captain Wen belonged to a covenant, so this came as somewhat of a surprise. Still, a Laurel? There was not a diplomatic bone in that man’s body.

“We came up together,” the professor confirmed. “Though until last night I hadn’t seen him in years, not since the tussle in Tariac that got him put out to pasture.

The Aztlan grinned.

“I do believe he’s gotten worse,” he said. “That’s quite impressive.”

While Angharad struggled in vain with how she was meant to reply to such a thing – agree, question, politely ignore? – the man cleared his throat.

“But you’re not here for old stories,” he said. “Let’s get you on your way to class.”

The professor jutted his thumb to the side, towards the open gates of stained glass.

“For today, you enter through there,” he said. “You’re headed to the western lecture hall, which means taking a left just after getting past the door. Before the great hall, to be clear. Don’t go inside it.”

He puffed at his pipe, afterwards exhaling the smoke through his nostrils. Angharad crinkled her nose at the smell of tobacco. It was a most distasteful vice. Father had greatly despised it, to the extent he had once tried to talk her mother out of even shipping the leaves.

“The path is straightforward,” Professor Tenoch told them. “About every ten feet there will be a metal stake hammered into the floor that has a yellow ribbon tied onto it. Follow that trial and it will lead you directly to the lecture hall that is your destination.”

The Aztlan then leaned in.

“Do not, under any circumstances, stray off that path,” he said. “Scholomance is not your mother’s salon: the school is very much alive and out to kill every soul within its walls.”

Angharad stilled at the blunt admission. She had felt the whole business to be sinister from the start but not expected to hear it so plainly said.

“Until you have learned to navigate the halls, never wander away from the stakes,” Professor Tenoch continued. “They force Scholomance to remain continuous in a radius around them, which stops it changing the layout so it can lead you into its depths to get you killed.”

The professor raised four fingers.

“Here are four rules that should help you live through the year, given out courtesy of my good mood,” he said.

Angharad straightened her back. Despite how he presented himself, she was not inclined to dismiss his words. Surely the Watch would not have taken him on as a professor were he as careless as he looked.

“First: never trust anything you hear or see outside a closed room. Scholomance can and will shift itself the moment you are no longer paying attention, but within the closed boundary of a room it cannot do so.”

A finger went down.

“Two: never go around alone or unarmed. The school willlead lemures and devils towards you if it believes it has a chance of getting you killed. It does this carefully – there are only so many that still wander into clutches and it find it difficult to herd more than one at a time – but it will absolutely take the shot if it believes there is an opening.”

A second finger went down.

“Three – just to be sure, all of you still have your plaques?”

Nods all around. In truth, as Tristan had confiscated one from the Forty-Ninth during their failed ambush their cabal even had a spare.

“Good,” Professor Tenoch said. “Keep them on you at all times, and should you ever find yourself somewhere that does not appear to be Scholomance try to have constant skin contact with it.”

Angharad frowned at the warning, which seemed a sideways manner of referring to the strange place Tristan had stumbled into by accident.

“You’re talking about layers,” Maryam said.

“Ah, right, one of you found the Witching Hour already,” Professor Tenoch mused. “Indeed, be careful of layers. There is at least one that can be entered through the school grounds and Scholomance will try to trick you into that so beasties can possess you. Having a source of high purity Glare light helps prevent this, if you can afford one.”

They could not, even when counting the coin Angharad’s uncle had sent her. Such things were steeply priced, even more so on isolated islands like Tolomontera. The last two fingers came down and the hand with them.

“Fourth and final,” the professor said, “you should prepare for the eventuality of having failed to respect the first three rules.”

Angharad blinked in surprise.

“You will be tricked by Scholomance,” Professor Tenoch said with ironclad certainty. “It is an ancient and vicious entity, one that has swallowed many secrets and treasures to barter with. It will find a way to tempt you into doing something unwise eventually.”

Song’s face was forcefully even, Tristan’s openly skeptical, and Maryam’s hidden – she had pulled up her hood. Angharad was, in truth, inclined to believe the professor. She trusted in her will to resist a spirit when encountering them and their tricks, but to encounter them every day for years on end? That was a different story. Water always found a way through.

“You can deny this, of course,” the professor continued, “and find yourself lost when that day comes.”

He shrugged.

“Or you can plan for the eventuality and perhaps survive. It is up to you.”

The professor reached inside his oversized coat, producing a match and striking it against his sleeve. He lit anew the pipe that had gone out, puffing at it carefully. He then exhaled a stream of grey, humming in satisfaction, and Angharad wrinkled her nose again. The smell truly was foul, and she knew it clung to everything.

“Go on, then,” Professor Tenoch said. “Try to enjoy Mandate class, I hear good things of your teacher.”

Angharad licked her lips, hesitating. But if she did not ask, how was she to know?

“Sir,” she finally said. “Why does the Watch want us to study here, of all places? Why risk our lives?”

The man studied her a moment, as if weighing her with his eyes,

“Have you ever stood on the precipice of doing something wildly foolish, Tredegar?” he asked.

She thought of a lake black as ink, its surface unstirred by the wind yet reflecting the stars above like a mirror. Of a shrine like broken teeth, whispering into the silence. She could have turned back, that night. Taken the boat to the shore, kept moving north. She had not.

Angharad swallowed, then nodded.

“In those moments, it is our nature for doubt to creep in,” the professor said. “Hesitation, that urge to live.”

The man smiled, revealing stained teeth.

“Scholomance,” Professor Tenoch Sasan said, “is how we kill that voice.”

# Chapter 13

They looked like ghostly vines, faint curls of smoke that were reaching hungry hands.

Song could see them creeping across the checkered, cracked floor of the entrance hall. The god was everywhere, blind hands tugging and pulling at the insides of Scholomance like a child at play – moving this and that, just itching to smash it all onto something that would scream. Hand on the chisel, she reminded herself. Fear would do her no good in this place. Fear never helped anywhere.

Hammered into the floor were metal spikes, each tied with a colored ribbon, and four paths unfolded deeper into the school. Two through the great hall whose massive span she could only glimpse in the distance, one going up a set of stairs to the right and the promised yellow-ribbon trail headed left. Lanterns hung from the ceiling, intricate pieces of silver and gold – and the matching light within came from flowers of the same tint, gently glowing.

“Don’t touch those lanterns,” Maryam warned. “Those flowers inside are fresfloren, light made into metal.”

“Dangerous?” Song asked.

“Eating a petal will turn your insides into a slurry of blood,” she said. “I am unsure what merely touching would do, but…”

“Best not to risk it,” Abrascal finished. “I hear you.”

“They are quite pretty, for something so deadly,” Angharad mused.

Song could hear another cabal approaching and she had no intention of lingering here so she took the lead and let the others fall in behind her. Save for the spikes and the lanterns, the hallway they took was little different from any other. The stonework was delicate and the pale gray stone of great quality, but aside from that Scholomance did not seem all that different from any other great edifice.

If you could ignore the vines of smoke slowly creeping in their wake, the god’s attention following them. Song forced herself not to look at it, or the red-dressed goddess by Abrascal’s side that feigned skipping along and taking in the sights in some sort of twisted game. She kept talking and pointing, no doubt filling the thief’s ears with dangerous secrets.

That he was not yet a Saint was almost as fearful a thing as if he had become one.

The Thirteenth passed several closed doors, a long window of clear but patterned glass that seemed to reveal an intricate crypt whose tombs were adorned with tortured, bejeweled effigies and two sets of stairs leading up to the story above. It was soon after the latter of these they found what must be the western lecture hall, for the last ribboned spike jutted out a mere few feet before wide open oaken doors. Song was the first to cross, abandoning the golden light behind for the clearer Glare burn inside.

The lecture hall was large and broadly circular, but that was not what drew the eye: it appeared to have no ceiling.

Tall, curving support beams of marble cut into an open view of firmament like slender rabbit’s ribs but Song knew this could not be true. There was a second story above, they had passed the stairs leading there on the way, and there was a roof above that level besides. The Glare-lit sky she beheld must thus be an illusion, which was equally impossible by simple virtue of the fact she beheld it at all.

Song Ren saw the truth of things. This, and only this, could she count on as the foundation of who she was.

Therefore the sky she was looking at, that dark expanse swept by the lights of the Grand Orrery, must be both impossible and true. She peeled open the contradiction like a riddle, concluding this: first, she was truly looking at the sky above Scholomance. Second, it was not possible for this to be the roof of the room she stood in and indeed it was not. Professor Tenoch had several times mentioned that the school shifted, so Song was merely looking at a ceiling of Scholomance, not the one originally belonging to this hall.

The god of this place had decided that yawning emptiness above was to be the ceiling to their first lesson.

Satisfied she had settled the matter within the bounds of her understanding, the Tianxi let her gaze move on from the expanse above. Three fourths of the hall were filled with long desks on descending platforms – each apt to sit four, with chairs to match – while the last fourth bore only the professor’s desk and a large writing slate set on wooden easel. At a glance there were thirty desks, more than were needed for the number of students, and no sign of the professor meant to teach the class.

They had their pick of the room, as their cabal had arrived early enough only three others preceded them. The Thirteenth earned a few curious glances, but no one seemed inclined to chat. Fourteen students, Song counted, five contractors among them. She suggested they claim desk on the right edge, near the middle of the rows, and was largely met with acquiescence – Angharad tried to argue for the front, but the others were lukewarm at the prospect.

Using her cabal’s movement to hide it Song took a longer look at the contracts present, catching glimpses of the golden letters unfolding above their heads. Two in Antigua, two in Umoya and one in Omeyetl – the Aztlan language she was least familiar with. She discarded that last attempt immediately, and her Antigua was better than her Umoya so she discarded those as well. Of the remaining two she was able to read some mention of… water-stepping, or perhaps walking on water? The other was about memory in some manner, but she could not look any longer without risking notice.

She slid into a seat at the left edge of the table, beside Angharad.

“There’s a peephole in the door,” Tristan noted.

Song’s gaze followed where his had gone, finding a thick wooden door opposite the one they had used to enter the hall. There were some decorative bronze castings on the wood, long gone green, and cleverly hidden within she caught the glint of light on glass.

“Odds are good the professor is looking at us through it,” she said. “Best we behave accordingly.”

The chairs were not particularly comfortable, the wood digging into her back, but it was not intolerable discomfort. It would serve to keep awake should she tire, at least. Song unpacked, preparing a stack of papers as well as a reed pen and an inkwell. No such instructions had been given, but it paid to be prepared. By the time she was done there was chatter in the hall, a large wave of students arriving all at once – and among them some faces she would not call familiar but recognized from description.

“Make room to draw,” she told Angharad, then glanced at the others. “Ready yourselves.”

The captain was not looking for them, or anyone in particular, but with so few seated it was only a matter of time until – Captain Tengfei Pan of the Forty-Ninth Brigade, whose foolishness meant the handsome face and neat Sanxing knot were wasted, let out a snarl at the sight of the seated Thirteenth. Or, more specifically, the sight of Tristan Abrascal on the table’s other edge.

“You,” the man snapped.

“Me?” Abrascal asked, sounding bemused.

Song did not need to look to know Abrascal was putting on an angelic smile. It was radiating off the thief like heat in a cold room. Five cabalists, she noted, two contracts among them – both on Tianxi men. The short, chubby one with the covered topknot was revealed to be called Huang Pan by his contract. A relation of the captain, or simply from the same region?

The other one, which Abrascal had pegged as a Skiritai, was named Muchen He. The text of his contract was short, which Song had learned to mean it was either markedly above or below average in effectiveness. Having a contract with loose terms meant you received what your god felt like giving you, which could vary significantly between individuals depending on the relationship.

Captain Tengfei stomped over angrily, followed by his cabal.

Song spared a heartbeat to consider the two she had skimmed over, the Lierganen girl called Ramona – Abrascal had clocked her as wanting to replace the captain, a fellow Stripe – and the nameless Malani girl who seemed remarkably capable of walking for someone who’d been crippled a mere two days ago. That one’s dark eyes kept straying to Abrascal, warring between fear and hatred. Someone had made an impression.

“You filthy sneak,” Captain Tengfei snarled. “You robbedus.”

Song’s contract had turned her eyes silver, but in truth it did not use them to work. While it only worked on what her eyes were ‘seeing’, it was a conceptual limit and not physical one. On the first hints she’d had of this as a child was that human eyes could only take in so many details at once while she had no such limitations. So Song breathed in and blinked once, languidly.

Then she took in the five people before her like a painting made in a heartbeat.

Ramona, fair-haired and scarred across the nose, was leaning in but her eye was on Tengfei and not the Thirteenth. She was waiting for an opportunity to cut in, to correct him. Muchen’s eyes had dipped slightly past Song, at the height Angharad’s sheathed saber should be. There was no wariness in his dark gaze, no flinch. He would not balk at a fight. Huang Pan was already flinching away, like a turtle trying to bury inside its shell, and was leaning back. The Malani? Leaning in, hands near a knife.

She wanted a fight, to bleed Tristan as he had bled her. Setting her off would be trivially easy.

Standing in front of them all Captain Tengfei Pan was not only angry, but angry enough that in his haste to loom over her he had wedged the table between the two of them – the angriest of them, she decided, but not actually prepared for a fight. Operating on feelings, not a plan.

Song breathed out, smiling, and ignored the other captain completely. She caught Ramona’s eye and cocked an eyebrow.

“You allow your man to speak on your behalf, captain?”

Cold, gleeful delight slid into that blue gaze.

“He still fancies himself captain, you see,” Ramona replied.

Another blink. Tengfei half a step back, unprepared for the flanking by an assumed ally. Muchen’s eyes slid away from Angharad, more worried about this than the Pereduri drawing. Which means either his judgment is mud or infighting is a real possibility.

“I am captain of this brigade,” Tengfei harshly said.

Song feigned surprise.

“Even after that botched ambush and allowing you to be stolen from?” she asked. “His leadership must be distinguished indeed.”

She cocked his head to the side.

“Unless he compensated you for causing the loss of funds.”

Ramona laughed cruelly.

“Now wouldn’t that be something. You going to do that, Teng?”

“Now is not the time,” Muchen cut in flatly.

Another blink. The Lierganen was shifting to face the tallest of the three Tianxi, and by far the most muscled. Wary of him, likely to bend if pressed. Should Muchen and Tengfei browbeat Ramona back into line, this would return to the original trajectory. Diversion, then. There was an obvious pressure point to us for it, and it would dovetail into an earlier weakness.

Song smiled at the yet nameless Malani, who’d barely even glanced at her teammates as they bickered.

“How is your leg, anyhow?” she asked. “I hear Lady Knot does good work, but surely a crippling cannot be cheaply bought off.”

The Malani’s face twisted and she drew the short sword at her side.

“Ya smug bitch,” she hissed. “Ya think just ‘cause we’re inside Scholomance I won’t-”

And now…

“Fara,” Captain Tengfei sharply said, “don’t-”

He had come to pick a fight but was not ready for it – and so would react to it being started on another’s terms by reflexively pulling back. ‘Fara’ turned to glare at her captain, and so the cabal was no longer split between Ramona and her opposition but between two factions. Now Tengfei Pan had a choice to make. Either he turned right around and forced a fight, in which case Song had her hand on her pistol and would shoot him in the stomach at the first sign of violence. Or he would decide that it was too risky to attack when his house was in disorder, swallow the humiliation and pull back for now.

Song saw the conflict in his eyes, the hesitation. How it only worsened his reputation in the eyes of his cabal. A bad decision made quickly was better than the finest decision made too late.

“Tengfei,” Huang nervously said. “We’re in a lecture hall, we shouldn’t make trouble.”

And that settled it, Song saw. Captain Tengfei sneered, straightening his back, and took the excuse his perhaps-kin had provided.

“This isn’t over,” Tengfei Pan said, “count the-”

It came from a dead angle. That was why Song did not see the pistol pointed at the side of the captain’s head until the last moment – when a finger pulled the trigger, the shot exploding in a billow of smoke. Utter surprise blanked her mind for a heartbeat, but she had not gone blind.

That was too little smoke.

A heartbeat later Tengfei Pan backed away coughing, the side of the head covered in soot as his cabal drew blades and pistols – even the trembling Huang. The man that’d just fired a blank, underpowdered shot at the captain of the Forty-Ninth idly pointed down the pistol and crossed his arms.

“Shoo,” Tupoc Xical said. “You’re boring me. If you’re going to get everyone’s hopes up, at least stab someone before flouncing off. This is just embarrassing.”

“I don’t know who you are,” Captain Tengfei said, “but if you think you can-”

“I just did,” the Izcalli replied, flashing perfect teeth. “Fight or flee, Forty-Nine. You’ve blown enough smoke for the day.”

Tengfei flicked a glance their way, his body tense as a spring. He knew, just like Song, that almost the entire class was now present and looking at them – some of them with weapons out from the noise, but most looking on like vultures awaiting a meal. If he backed down now, he was done. His reputation buried. If he did not back down, however…

Song calmly placed her pistol atop the table and the other Tianxi’s jaw clenched. Yes, if he fought now he was risking tangling with two cabals at once. The damage would be more than simply reputational. Tupoc was currently using the Forty-Ninth as a stepping stone for his Fourth’s reputation, so the Aztlan was sure to bleed them a little to make his point. And as Tengfei Pan kept hesitating, the death knell of his authority came when Muchen stepped forward.

“We are done here,” the dark-eyed man stated. “This is not the time or place.”

Song suspected that when talks were next had with the Forty-Ninth, she would be sitting across from Captain Ramona.

“Fine,” Captain Tengfei said, putting on a halfhearted sneer. “Come on, the air here has fouled.”

And as he stalked off angrily, his cabal following him in fits and starts as whispers bloomed across the lecture hall, Song was left with a situation that she was not strictly sure was an improvement.

“My friends,” Captain Tupoc Xical grinned. “What a great pleasure it is to see you again!”

His cabal had followed him, though they’d held back from the confrontation and were still holding back now. Song’s gaze swept through them quickly enough to confirm none held a contract, then settled on the Izcalli himself. The bastard had not changed a whit since the Dominion. Eerily symmetrical and pale-eyed, the too-perfect Aztlan sported no sign of ever having had an eye taken from him by Zenzele.

Not unexpected. A single term in Centzon – yekayotl – kept Song from grasping the fullness of Tupoc’s contract, but she knew that it was at its strongest when given time to work. More interesting was the question of what a nobody from no great family had done to attract the attention of the Grave-Given, one of the most famous gods of Izcalli.

“The implication that we are in any way friendly is the most insulting thing I have heard in some time,” Song replied after a short pause.

“I could give a whirl to beating that, if you’d like,” he affably replied.

Behind Song, whispers bloomed anew.

“The hundred-group is the same for all the general classes, right?” Abrascal asked.

“I believe it is,” Maryam grimly replied.

“Sigh,” the thief said, making a point of speaking the word instead of sighing.

Obnoxious as Abrascal was, he was right it was no pleasant turn to learn they would be stuck in the same room as Tupoc Xical five half-days a week. Such a punishment should follow a crime, at the very least. By the time Song’s attention fully returned to the wolf at the gate, Tupoc had ushered his cabal closer and begun introducing them. He’s pretending there are ties between our brigades, Song realized. The eyes of most the room were still on them.

“Alejandra Torrero, my second,” Tupoc said. “The rest, in succession-”

Song’s eyes slid over the small, scowling dark-haired Lierganen girl he had just introduced – a signifier, according to Abrascal – and onto the others.

“Bait.”

A nervous, bespectacled Someshwari. He had a fighter’s frame, she noted, but did not hold himself as one. It was not a kind thought, but Bait looked like a man who had all the willpower of a piece of soggy bread. No wonder Abrascal had cracked him in a matter of minutes.

“Expendable.”

A gloomy Malani boy with startling yellow eyes that would have leant him a fierce and wolflike look, if not for the way he kept staring at the ground. Contractor.

“Last and least, Acceptable Losses.”

A Tianxi girl with a heavily scarred face – the entire left half was burned, that eye a milky white. She let out a giggle at the introduction, baring crooked teeth. Song cocked an eyebrow at her.

“Condolences on your cabal,” she said in Cathayan.

The girl snorted back.

“Pity from a Ren?” she said, then spat on the ground. “This for that.”

Song let the insult wash over her. She had heard worst from countrymen and with less prompting. Unfortunately, she had forgot that not all her cabalists were so restrained.

“Your manners,” Angharad Tredegar coldly said, “are lacking.”

Song only half-glanced back, but it was enough to see the Pereduri had that dueling look in her eyes. We cannot be involved in two fights so quickly, Song thought. It will make us pariahs, too much trouble to associate with. That might well be what Tupoc was after, in truth. For all his swagger the man was rather canny.

“Now now, Lady Angharad,” Tupoc chided, “don’t go glaring at Acceptable Losses. I love her like my own child, until the moment it becomes moderately inconvenient to me for that to be true.”

And now Song needed to cut that off before the noblewoman was drawn into his pace and they were all made to dance on the palm the Izcalli’s hand. Attack, riposte.

“There are better ways to ask for a meeting, Captain Tupoc,” Song said, raising her voice enough the nearest tables would be able to overhear. “Despite your reckless behavior on the Dominion, we would have heard you out for old time’s sake.”

A hard glint entered Tupoc’s eyes as they slid off Angharad and moved to her. It won’t be that easy to burn all our bridges and force us to bargain with you for alliance, Xical, she thought. This was not the Dominion and while Tupoc was no smaller a fish the pond had grown a great deal larger. The other captain opened his mouth, but his reply was cut off by the sound of a door being opened.

The hall went silent in an instant, a reluctant Tupoc shepherding his cabal to the table behind the Thirteenth’s – unfortunate – as the woman likely to be their professor closed the door behind her and strode past her desk.

She was Someshwari, in her early thirties and unusually tall. Close to six feet, by Song’s reckoning. Straight-backed and tanned, the watchwoman was in the coat of a combat uniform and that did not appear to be a mere pretension: there was a hollow in the professor’s right cheek that must be a scar from getting shot, pulling up the side of her lip slightly. Her dark hair was kept in a crown braid and she had a pistol at her hip, elegant gold loop earrings the sole concession to coquettishness.

Calm black eyes swept the room, finding the students within seated and silent, and gave a pleased nod.

“My name is Kavita Iyengar,” she said, the Antigua accentless. “So long as I teach in Scholomance, you may refer to me as Professor Iyengar or ma’am.”

Turning, she took a piece of chalk from atop her desk and moved up to the writing slate on the easel.

“First, allow me to speak plainly: there is no such thing as a ‘Mandate’ field of studies,” Professor Iyengar said, writing the word on the slate. “It is merely a useful way of naming what you are to be taught here, which is not a coherent corpus of learning.”

She turned a steady look on them, the scarred cheek pulling up the corner of her lip into something almost a smirk.

“This class is not merely an introduction to the workings of the Watch but a study of what the Watch is and what purposes it serves in Vesper,” she said. “This will involve history, statecraft, law and commerce as well as rote memorization. On the last of these you will be tested every two months by assignment.”

The professor’s voice was as stern as her demeanor, Song thought. Unless she missed her mark it was trained, and she herself trained in oration. That bearing was too martial for her to be Arthashastra, so the easy guess was Academian.

“Given that many of you will have ties to the Watch, you may question what my qualifications are to teach you in this regard,” Professor Iyengar said.

Song found not a hint of that in the room. The professor was not someone whose mien invited backtalk.

“I was, until three months ago, commodore to the second squadron of the Garrison’s eastern fleet,” Professor Iyengar said, and that got a few gasps.

Someone on the other side of the hall exclaimed ‘Iron Tigers’, which got even more gasps. The professor ignored them. Song did not know that name, but the rank was impressive. A commodore was a flag officer – the lowest of them, true, but Professor Iyengar was still young for such a rank. She must have distinguished herself greatly, and she was almost sure to be an Academy graduate.

Uncle Zhuge had told her that Stripes always promoted each other when they could, an unseen thread of fellowship running across both the Garrison and the free companies.

“My assigned duties were to hunt rampant gods and track pirate flotillas back to their lairs,” Professor Iyengar informed that. “As a result of their exercise, I have fought in two wars and negotiated six treaties on behalf of the Conclave with the nations of the Riven Coast – be they ruled by men or hollows.”

Impressive, Song mused, though the ‘nations’ of the Riven Coast were hardly worth such a grand word. That stripe of coast to the east of Sacromonte was an ever-shifting patchwork of petty kingdoms and pirate havens, the distinction between them often narrow.

“Earlier in my career, I spent two years serving on the staff of our ambassador to Old Saraya and distinguished myself sufficiently to be recommended to the Academy and graduate with commendations.”

Impossibly, the professor straightened further and folded her hands behind her back.

“Should any of you deem these qualifications insufficient, speak now.”

Utter silence answered her. Humorlessly, the professor nodded.

“Then we will begin,” Professor Iyengar said. “I have been instructed that today is not to be a full class, merely an introduction to the subject matter, and though this seems to me unnecessary the decision is not mine to make.”

She stepped back closer to the slate, chalk still in hand.

“I will ask you all, then, a simple question. Any of you wishing to answer it may raise your hand, and when called on will provide their name and brigade before elaborating.”

Song cocked an eyebrow. That smacked of a trap.

“What is the Watch for?” Professor Iyengar asked.

There was some tittering but the Tianxi did not join in it. Simple questions were always the most difficult to answer, because they required you to define the building blocks of the concepts every other mode of understanding was made of. Fortunately, this time Song had the inside track.

She refrained from raising her hand, knowing that immediately giving out the correct answer would both run against the instructor’s purpose and position her as a teacher’s pet besides. Instead, as a dozen hands went up she leaned back into her seat and began discreetly counting contracts. The distraction serve to keep her curiosity under wraps.

The professor called on a dark-skinned boy in front.

“Kasigo Njezi, Twenty-Third Brigade,” he smoothly said, then cleared his throat. “The Watch’s purpose is twofold. To protect Vesper from the Old Night, the threat without, and the unchecked gifts of spirits, the threat within.”

It had the cadence of words recited to it, which their professor soon confirmed.

“That is the exact line the Conclave likes to answer my question with,” Professor Iyengar acknowledged. “It is the answer you will be expected to give out there in the world, certainly, so mark it well.”

She turned a stern gaze on them.

“It is also incorrect.”

The dark-skinned boy bit his lip, displeased. Song spared some attention for the exchange, but mostly she kept up the count. She was nearly halfway done. It would have been faster, but she had paused to make certain she was not mistaken and someone had truly struck a bargain with a god named the Tail-Puller.

“At any time, somewhere in the vicinity of six tenths of the Watch is in the employ of nations great and small,” the professor informed them. “It has been centuries since more watchmen than not dedicated their days to old gods and forbidden contracts.”

She paused.

“Knowing this, can you still maintain the assertion that our true mandate is what you described?”

Kasigo Njezi did not answer, which was answer enough.

“Try again,” Professor Iyengar addressed the room.

Song did not raise her hand, instead finishing the last row and her count with it. There were ninety-eight students in the lecture hall, and of these twenty-seven had contracts. Roughly a fourth, which held to the proportion she had marked out in the streets of Port Allazei. Among students, anyhow. The local garrison held truer to the realities of Vesper beyond this isle, barely any contracted in it.

With three of its four members being contractors the Thirteenth was above average in its proportion of god-gifted to not, but it was notthe most stacked in this regard. Song had picked out a cabal of six whose every member held a contract, a brigade she would ardently strive against ever being at odds with. Even the least of contracts could be dangerous in clever hands.

A second student was called on, a Lierganen with long dark hair on the other side of the teaching hall.

“Cressida Barboza, Nineteenth Brigade,” she said.

Song’s eyes narrowed. Abrascal had reported to her that Bait, Tupoc’s erstwhile spy, had been brought into the party by a ‘Lady Cressida’ of the Nineteen Brigade. The hard, hatchet-faced girl she was looking should be that very one. By the way Abrascal leaned in further down the table, he’d caught on as well.

“No contract,” Song whispered just loudly enough for him to hear.

He let out a sigh of relief, nodding in thanks.

“The Watch,” Cressida Barboza said, “are ratcatchers.”

That set half the class to murmuring until the professor quelled them with a look.

“Continue,” she ordered.

“We are meant to cull the numbers of hollows and lemures before they can become a threat,” Cressida said. “When we do not, kingdoms fall.”

The professor studied the girl for a moment.

“Lusitanian, are you?” she finally asked.

“Yes,” Cressida bitterly replied.

“You are not wrong,” Professor Iyengar told her. “Preventing cults and lemures from growing enough to become a risk is the most important reason the free companies of the Watch exist.”

She then stepped away, hands behind her back once more.

“The free companies, however, are not the whole of our order. If the whole of our mandate is the culling, Cressida, why does the Garrison exist?” Professor Iyengar asked.

Cressida scowled.

“To allow for multiple free companies to take the field together when there are threats too great for a single one,” she said.

The professor shook her head.

“If that were true, the Watch would be a loose alliance of mercenary bands,” Professor Iyengar said. “Yet the Garrison numbers between half and a third of the Watch, depending on the leaning of the decade.”

Professor Iyengar turned to address the hall at large.

“There are practical reasons for our order to exist beyond the need for hands to spill the blood that keeps the cogs of civilization greased.”

The Lierganen looked unconvinced, but she bowed her head in concession. With a gesture, the professor opened the question to the class again. Song raised her hand this time, but it was an Izcalli boy out in the back that was picked. He had to raise his voice to be heard but not by much. The hall’s acoustics were impressive.

“Patli Cuateco, Brigade Thirty-Six,” he announced in accented Antigua. “The purpose of the Watch is to preserve the know-how of deicide, to ensure that a force capable of killing the old god always stands ready to fight.”

“Closer,” Professor Iyengar praised. “You are correct that the Watch exists because of the limitations of nations, which have to allocate their limited resources to purposes other than our work, but what lies under our black cloaks is not so unique. Every great power of Vesper trains and fields soldiers to do the what the Watch does.”

There were some disbelieving murmurs. The professor cocked an eyebrow.

“The Crocodile Society of Izcalli,” she listed. “The Lefthand House of Malan, the Savituri orders of Someshwar and Tianxia’s endless gaggle of chivalrous sects. All are taught how to hunt cults and gods, doing so supported by the treasury of rulers to one degree or another. Make no mistake – the Watch is better at its trade than anyone else in Vesper, but we hold no monopoly.”

Song frowned. It was true that wuxia sects sent their disciples into the countryside to gather experience by slaying evil and protecting the innocent, which often meant facing off against wicked cults and their patron gods. It was equally true that the individual republics had close relations with the larger sects based in their lands, relations that included funding and permissions.

She had never considered those two facts put together, or that the sect traditions might have a purpose beyond the stated one. An outside perspective could help open one’s mind to the truth, she reminded herself. This time when the professor opened the question to the class again, only a few raised their hand. Song was one of them and to her pleasure found herself called on.

“Song Ren, Thirteenth Brigade,” she announced. “The Watch exists to enforce the Iscariot Accords.”

Dozens of gazes stayed on her, expecting addition and elaboration, but Song simply leaned back in her seat. None was needed. To her surprise, Professor Iyengar laughed – the sound more akin to a gunshot than anything mirthful.

“That is factually true,” the professor said.

Song straightened with pride.

“And the closest to accurate I have heard today.”

Her face shuttered. Closest? It was the plain truth, as told to her. Professor Iyengar’s eyes slid off her as she turned to address the hall at large.

“If Kagiso’s answer earlier was the Conclave’s favorite line, then Song just gave me the Academy’s. It is, to the word, what officers are taught there.”

As it should be, coming straight of Uncle Zhuge’s mouth. Was Professor Iyengar not a Stripe as well? The tall woman shrugged.

“You are all, however, students of Scholomance,” Professor Iyengar said. “Your perspective cannot be so narrow and Song’s answer is very much that.”

The Tianxi’s face tightened as the professor turned back to her.

“Tell me true, Song Ren,” she said. “If tomorrow the Grasshopper King refused to let us enforce the Iscariot Accords within his lands, would the Watch have the power to go against his will?”

Song’s face was stiff as she shook her head. The king of Izcalli had a great army – the greatest in Vesper, should the Someshwar not be stirred to unity – and a wealthy land under him. The Watch could not hope to beat him through either steel or gold.

“No,” she forced out.

“No,” Professor Iyengar agreed. “The Lunkulu Crisis, back in the Century of Accord, made our limitations clear. When faced with the real prospect of going to war with the Kingdom of Malan, the Watch was forced to bargain regardless of being in the right.”

Song knew only the bare bones of that incident, which had never come to fighting and so rarely warranted more than passing mention in histories. The High Queen of Malan’s purges of country gods had begun tensions, she remembered, along with her outlawing foresight contracts in her kingdom. To decree such a thing had been solely the Watch’s prerogative under the Iscariot Accords. Song recalled that when threatened with sanctions, the Queen Perpetual had in turned threatened to turn several free companies to her service and found her own rival Watch.

“Make no mistake,” the professor said. “By tradition the Watch is counted as one of the great powers of Vesper, sometimes even a successor state in its own right, but in truth it would be hard-pressed to win a war against any of them. We cannot enforce our will by force on peer powers, and often not even lesser ones.”

The Someshwari swept the class with her gaze.

“So what is the Watch for, then?” she repeated once more.

This time no hands went up. She had exhausted the boldness of those present, Song included.

“The simple answer to a complicated truth,” Professor Iyengar said, “is that we exist to be neutral.”

She stepped away from the tables, returning to her writing slate. There, after erasing the word Mandate, she drew a quick, sharp outline that Song and any other Tianxi in the room had no difficulty in recognizing. It was northern Tianxia, more or less. Two republics, mountains and beyond the passes the wolves of east and west: Someshwar and Izcalli.

“Allow me to use as an example one of the most recent large-scale wars of Vesper,” Professor Iyengar said. “I will speak to you now of the invasion of Caishen by the raja of Kuril, known as the Kuril Dance to some and the Long Burn to others.”

A dance to Someshwari, who in their distant palaces thought it all a game. The Long Burn to Song’s people, who had seen much of Caishen’s precious fields and rice farms turned into an ash-strewn graveyard for a decade and a half. Professor Iyengar traced two lines, one leading from the raj of Kuril into northern Caishen and another from the eastern borderlands of Izcalli into the same republic’s left flank.

Two simple strokes of chalk to represent a bogged down invasion by Kuril followed by a horde of Izcalli sunflower lords charging it to loot, enslave and set aflame.

“Over the span of the war, the main theater of battle proved to be the northern half of the territory of the Republic of Caishen,” the professor said, encircling the region. “Can anyone here tell me why?”

Two dozen hands went up. Song had not turned to see who was picked to answer, so she was surprised by the voice.

“Captain Tupoc Xical, Fourth Brigade.”

She resisted the urge to turn and look at him.

“Izcalli forces attempted to push into the core regions of Caishen but never managed to break the defensive line at Hanshan, forcing the offensive to push contest the northern flatlands instead.”

Xical spoke plainly and without taunt or untruth, but the simple description still had Song clenching her jaw.

Hanshan lilies bloom only red

liars that do not bring but bury

I dream of powder-song dirges

and blood like fresh dew

It was said that to speak Shaoqing Mao’s famous poem in a Caishen tea parlor was sure to bring at least one old man to tears. More soldiers had died storming and holding the slopes of Hanshan fortress than there had been land to bury them, and the tales claimed had been so many corpses in the river the Izcalli had used them like a ford.

“Correct. That led to a situation where three states with broad parity of means and men contested the same region, resulting in the northern flatlands changing hands so often between the belligerents that they effectively became lawless for over a decade,” Professor Iyengar said, tone matte-of-fact.

You are Watch, Song reminded herself. The Watch does not take sides.

“The mountain chains between Caishen and Kuril are riddled with hollow tribes,” the professor continued, “so the chaos inevitably resulted in the empowerment of cults even as the local gods began going rampant.”

Lesser gods were fragile, Song new, not yet fully set in their nature. They could go mad from having their shrines trampled or their followers slain, sometimes even simply from them taking to death a littletoo well. The ensuing madness – rampancy, the Watch called it – saw them turn on the living viciously.

“Now,” Professor Iyengar said, “the cultists raids and escalating rampancies were a gain to no belligerent involved. Yet to suppress these activities would have required either heavy garrisoning, or the halt offensive action until their possessions could be consolidated.”

The professor folded her arms behind her back.

“What would have been the rational answer, in this situation?”

Hands went up again and a familiar face was called on.

“Muchen He, Forty-Ninth Brigade,” the perhaps-Skiritai said. “They should have brokered a truce and purged their held territories of cults and rampant gods.”

His contract was Cathayan, but extremely old-fashioned. Song itched to jot it down to read properly later, but it would be too obvious and Tupoc would be watching from behind her.

“Yes,” Professor Iyengar approvingly said. “That would have been the right decision. What happened, instead, was that whenever an attempt was made to take a defensive posture it was immediately punished by the other belligerents.”

The Someshwari wrinkled her nose in disgust.

“There are even alleged occasions of cults being armed to they would undermine the opposition.”

Song was not surprised to hear it. Tianxia’s neighbors had long ago grown adept at using the tensions between the Republics to their advantage, that they would extend such policies to hollow cults was simply the natural extension of the practice.

“The very notion of truce or even just consolidation became toxic to mention,” Professor Iyengar told them, “which leads us to the incident that tipped over the vase: Kuril troops shelled an old temple, releasing a god of the Old Night bound there by the Second Empire.”

She marked the slate with chalk, though to Song’s eye in the wrong region. She had been given to understand it was closer to the western borders.

“The Mist Serpent was sealed along with a horde of its finest bound servants, rapidly overwhelming the troops present and displaying the very reason Liergan saw fit to seal it: its ability to seize the unworthy dead and press them into service.”

Song could almost feel the hall wincing.

“The situation turned disastrous in a matter of weeks,” Professor Iyengar said. “Yet no belligerent withdrew, as such a defeat would mean facing grave consequences at home.”

Song was unfamiliar with the ruling circles of Caishen, but she suspected a general tacitly ceding half the republic’s holdings to the enemy would be publicly executed after a brisk formality of a trial. Tianxia had not lost significant territory since the end of the Cathayan Wars and to suggest anything to the contrary would be… ill received.

“All three powers wanted an end to the war,” the professor said, “but none of them could afford to call it.”

She set down the chalk on her desk.

“What happened after?”

Hands went up. Song did not pay attention to the boy called on, save that his name sounded Someshwari.

“The Watch stepped in, invoked the Iscariot Accords and forced a truce in Caishen until the Mist Serpent was slain and its servants released to the Circle.”

Professor Iyengar nodded.

“Indeed,” she said. “Which leads me to my point.”

She eyed them all seriously.

“The Watch could have easily forced the Izcalli border lords, the Caishen militia or the raja of Kurin to withdraw from the region if they did not wish to – much less all three forces at once. But they did retreat when called on to, because they already desired to do so.”

And so the Watch had been a mere pretext, the professor was implying.

“The Watch’s position as a neutral, otherwise uninvolved power allowed the belligerents to retreat without losing face, each claiming at home that they would have prevailed if the war continued,” Professor Iyengar continued. “We were, in that sense, an excuse for them to act in a manner they already wanted to.”

The professor smiled, the mocking tilt of her lips pulling further.

“I can almost hear the doubt,” she said. “How you tell yourselves we must be more than an excuse, surely, that all those ships and guns and fortresses must amount to something greater. So I invite you to consider some facts.”

The smiled went away.

“The Kuril Dance was the bloodiest war of the last fifty years involving great powers,” Professor Iyengar said. “It lasted for two decades and filled over a hundred thousand graves.”

And too few of those belonging to soldiers, Song thought.

“Now consider this: more soldiers died in the first two weeks of the Succession Wars than over the entire span of the entire Kuril Dance.”

The answering silence was resounding.

“The territory lost to the Gloam in the fall of Second Empire represents a number of souls broadly equal to the current population of Izcalli and the Imperial Someshwar added together,” the professor continued. “Children, the Watch exists because, when the great powers emerged from the red haze of war, they saw that the world around them had grown smaller.”

Such a harmless word for such a stark meaning. Smaller. Reduced. The Succession Wars had made the world less, permanently so.

“They saw the world needed ratcatchers,” Professor Iyengar said. “That it needed armed hands rooting out cults and hunting lemures that would not be stopped by borders. They saw that Vesper needed god-killers who would not be sent to die in petty battles, scholars who must be allowed to unearth truths uncomfortable to kings.”

The tall woman let that sink in for a moment, then broke the silence.

“The recognition of that need is called the Iscariot Accords.”

She was warming to her subject, Song thought, and she was not alone in that. She heard someone shift behind her, and was startled to see Tupoc leaning in with a fervent burning gaze.

“It is fitting that we are called blackcloaks,” Professor Iyengar said, “for the cloak matters most of all we wield. Not Signs or swords, not the ships or guns or burning secrets – few of these are unique to us, and in time none will be. The Watch exists because the great powers recognized that they cannot be trusted to enforce the Accords, either by themselves or on each other, and yet the Accords need to be enforced.”

The professor stood ramrod straight, but her dark eyes burned bright.

“We alone bear a black cloak, of all men and women, because it sets us apart. Because that is what the Watch is for: to stand apart, to be neutral.”

The professor gestured at them all.

“Over your years of wearing the black,” she said, “you will take sides. That is natural and inevitable – putting on the cloak does unmake the ties of roots and blood. But if you learn anything at all from your time in this hall, let it be this.”

Her gaze was all iron as she faced them.

“There is a line,” Kavita Iyengar said. “A watchman can take sides, but never the Watch. It is the sole poison our order cannot survive.”

Her lips pulled up in another mirthless smile.

“Do not ever forget that,” the professor warned them, “else the last thing you will ever hear is a Mask pulling the trigger.”

So ended the first lecture Song Ren was given at Scholomance.

—

After that striking end, a hush fell over the class.

Professor Iyengar ordered them to return next week with ink and paper enough to take notes, for the organization of the Watch would be covered in detail and those details would be tested on at a later date. Song kept an eye on the Forty-Ninth, but no threat came from there: they were out the door in moments, almost fleeing.

She had expected to be dealing with the Fourth, at least, but the lecture had left Tupoc with a strange a manic energy he seemed disinclined to turn on others for once. He exhorted his cabal to set out and prepare for their afternoon classes, handing Song an unpleasant reminder that the Izcalli was another Stripe recommendation and so she would be seeing him further.

Lovely.

With many students heading out the doors were clogged, leading the Thirteenth to elect staying behind. To discuss the lecture was only natural, and Song found she was not alone in disagreeing with some parts of what they had been told.

“It is the perspective of a high-ranking officer,” Song argued. “Someone who sees the situation from above – and only there.”

Abrascal nodded approvingly.

“Looking down puts on just as many blinders as looking up,” he agreed. “Mind you, that ominous little bit about the Masks seems true. It was implied to me the Krypteia is expected to deal with treachery within the ranks.”

Angharad stiffened. Upset, Song fondly thought, at the thought of any betrayal of the oaths they had all taken. The noblewoman was thoroughly reliable in such regards.

“I find it easy to believe that the Watch’s position as a broker between states is of paramount importance,” the dark-skinned woman said, forcefully changing the subject. “It explains why I have never heard of blackcloaks out in the colonies, despite the many savage spirits of those lands.”

It was said absent-mindedly, almost carelessly, and Song knew that no insult was meant. That did not mean none had been given – the look on Maryam’s face cold enough it would have made winter wince.

“As it happens I was recruited by an officer of the Watch out in the colonies, Tredegar,” Maryam snapped back. “As for savagery, the only kind I saw at work was that of the Malani.”

To her honor, the noblewoman’s contrition came quick and heartfelt.

“I meant no offense,” Angharad said.

That, however, had been a blunder.

“Then cease giving it, you fucking ass,” the Izvorica harshly retorted. “My patience has limits.”

Angharad visibly swallowed an answer, likely one involving how her own was stretched thin by Maryam’s constant barbs. Which was for the best, because while the blue-eyed signifier had rarely missed an opportunity for venom that venom was being kept at a boil by her the noblewoman’s constant small slights. Would their relationship have been cordial, should Angharad have more deftly navigated those waters? Outwardly, at least, Song believed it would have.

Maryam was polite to Zenzele Duma, who was just as lordly as Angharad and measurably more Malani. Part of that no doubt came from not having to continuously be in his presence, but Zenzele’s avoidance of any topics remotely related to colonies and slavery could not be hurting.

“There is no need for insults,” Angharad said through gritted teeth.

“That’s what I keep saying,” Maryam said. “Yet here we are, aren’t we?”

She grabbed her back and pushed forward, Angharad getting out of her way. Thank the gods for that, Song thought. Given their respective sizes and strength, had Maryam pushed into the Pereduri she would have been much more likely to bounce off than brush her aside. Angharad turned her gaze on them, almost pleading.

“Ill-done,” Abrascal simply said, grabbing his bag.

The thief traded a nod with her and followed after Maryam. Good, none of them should ever wander Scholomance alone. Song turned to Angharad with a sigh, which had the noblewoman’s jaw twitch with a suppressed wince. This one was on her head, the Tianxi decided, for not having taken the time to address the matter with Angharad yet. Given how full their time had been and the thaw she had thought she was witnessing Song had thought… no, an excuse. She had not made the time because she believed the situation under control.

That should be owned.

“Walk with me,” Song ordered.

Most of the lecture hall was gone by now, hurried out the door, so it was with little company that they returned to the pale gray halls and the path of stakes. Song still refrained from beginning the conversation until they were well out of Scholomance, back onto the great stony grounds. It was not difficult to find a bench tucked away near a faded bronze, Song inviting the noblewoman to sit while she remained standing.

“Abrascal was not wrong,” the captain said. “That was ill done of you.”

Angharad’s lips thinned.

“As I said, I meant no offense.”

“That is a foolish assertion, considering what you said,” she replied.

The noblewoman opened her mouth to speak, but was cut off by her captain’s raised hand.

“By your words, you implied that the land of her birth had no states in it,” Song said. “You then implied them to be savages.”

“Their spirits,” Angharad insisted. “I said their spirits are savage, not them. And it is true, Song. The tales I hear are chilling. Spirits that strangle all who come near their shore, serpents of flame whose whispers drive men to take their own lives and-”

Song leaned in.

“Are you certain, Angharad Tredegar, that you want to discuss dealings with savage gods?” she gently asked. “Holding the contract that you do?”

The other woman’s rising confidence crumpled. It had been an empty thing from the start.

“You have never been in Triglau – Izvorica – lands,” Song reminded her. “Your truths are all borrowed, and from men and women who have made a fortune out of clapping Maryam’s kin in irons.”

She hesitated, a heartbeat for it was a delicate subject.

“I do not know if House Tredegar ever traded in slaves-”

“No,” Angharad firmly said, then bit her lip. “But we shipped iron shackles and salted fish to Port Cadwyn that was meant for slave hulks.”

The Pereduri scowled.

“I know slavery is indecent, Song,” she said. “But the Izvorica do it to each other. I hear most slaves sold in the northern colonies are sold by the tribes themselves. Yet to hear her you would think Malani the sum of all evils for partaking in a trade that near every nation of Vesper practices.”

No one does it the way Malani do, Angharad, Song thought. She could have argued the point, laid it all out. How Malan’s practice of slavery was unprecedented: emptying towns, clapping entire tribes in iron and sending them in the western lands so they could toil until they died and their children toil after them. How even Izcalli granted rights to their serfs but the Malani shielded their slaves with no law, for why would any be needed when honor of their owner was the finest possible guarantee?

But that would have been losing themselves in the weeds, in the details of the argument. So instead she spoke another truth.

“I am a daughter of Tianxia, Angharad Tredegar,” Song Ren said. “Do you think to find sympathy in me for such evil? You forget who I am: all are free under Heaven.”

She met the noblewoman’s dark eyes, unflinching, as she spoke the words of the Feichu Tian

“If gods deny this, bury them beneath the river. If kings deny this, chop them in four quarters.”

Silver faced brown, unblinking.

“If slavers deny this, hang them with iron chains.”

Silence stretched between them. Angharad looked away first and Song released the breath she had been holding.

“You spoke carelessly to Maryam and have done so before,” she said. “She is not alone in finding this reprehensible – it does you no favors with either me or Abrascal.”

“Am I to lie, then?” Angharad bitterly said. “Praise her people with empty words, pretend they are not quarrelsome tribes hiding in hills at the end of the world?”

“If you cannot muster care for your own words,” Song flatly replied, “then silence will suffice. It is nothing less than what you ask of her.”

The other woman flinched. Twice struck in as many sentences. Song knew she had much used the stick today, and so she must adjust the approach lest this be remembered as nothing more than a browbeating.

“I expect there are brigades out there that will not require this of you,” the Tianxi said. “Should you wish to speak such words and opinions unchallenged, I can approach another captain for a trade on your behalf.”

She paused, shrugged.

“You are skilled and of good repute, it will not be difficult to find a taker.”

Angharad’s hackles rose like an angry cat’s. It would not have been the noblewoman’s natural inclination to leave, Song thought, but now that it had been framed as a failure to do so the prospect should be well and buried.

“I am capable of minding my own manners,” Angharad stiffly replied.

Vinegar first, now honey.

“That is a relief,” Song made herself admit. “Much of Abrascal rubs me the wrong way, so the tensions between you and Maryam have been a concern to me. I would not see our cabal break from within.”

The Pereduri was only too eager to change the subject to a weakness of Song’s, after the earlier exchange. Besides, now keeping the peace with Maryam was no longer just the noblewoman swallowing her words – it was a favor being done to Song, which Angharad would find much more palatable. She was willing to tolerate much more for the sake of others than she was for her own.

“I had noticed,” Angharad said. “Though I cannot bring myself to fully trust him, I must admit I have found him an agreeable fellow. Where lies the trouble?”

He’s a grenade with a lit fuse, Song could not say. One whose final explosion I cannot seem to predict the timing of.

“He is a competent but reckless man,” she said instead, choosing another truth, “whose actions I have only the barest influence over but whom I am and will remain responsible for. Worse, he has no intention of amending that behavior.”

‘Rat’ was an apt description, Song had often thought, for he took the authority much as the animal did. Behaving when there was light and attention on him, but returning to his tricks and plans without batting an eye the moment Song was no longer there to look at him. The Tianxi had no illusions of control over the thief: the moment she asked of him something he did not want to do, he would refuse. The authority of her captain’s rank simply did not weigh on the scales for Abrascal.

“Tristan has only known bad lords.”

Song blinked, returning her attention to Angharad.

“He does not respect authority because he has never known authority worth respecting,” the noblewoman said. “You act as if the part objected to is you, but it is not – it is the authority itself. That it is held by you is, I think, largely irrelevant to him.”

That was… it sounded reasonable, Song silently acknowledged. And though he should have been taught better as the pupil of a high-ranking watchwoman, his teacher was a Mask. Uncle Zhuge had opinions on their covenant, the kindest of which was ‘sometimes their existence is a necessary evil’. What was the solution, then? To show she was worthy of wielding authority? She was not sure how that would be done to a man of his background. It might well cross lines she was not willing to cross.

“I will think on that,” Song said. “My thanks.”

Angharad sighed, looking away.

“And I will think on what you have said,” she replied. “I would not allow myself to become the instrument of discord.”

It was start, Song thought, but talk would only get them so far. Angharad watching her tongue and Maryam holding back barbs would be the work of weeks, months. She needed mortar to bind the Thirteenth Brigade together, and that would require more practical reasons to come together.

A common enemy should serve fine, and it just happened that the world had seen fit to provide some for Song Ren to pick from.

# Chapter 14

Angharad sat on a bench to eat alone with her thoughts, which was no mercy.

Half her cabal was long gone, and the last member… Much as the noblewoman disliked sitting there brooding and biting at the tail of her own thoughts, to share a meal with Song after their previous conversation might have been worse. That her own captain had believed it necessary to inform her she lacked manners was mortifying beyond words. That Song had then considered she might prefer finding another cabal to mending her own behavior was much, much worse.

Had she truly tarred her own reputation so thoroughly without even noticing?

Oh, it was a certain thing that the others came into the matter with blinders. Tristan had been born to the gutter and so kept sharp sympathy for those on the losing side of history while Tianxi hated slavery enough to forgive anything of those inflicted it. And Maryam, she was understandably attached to the land of her birth regardless of its genuine merits. None of this, however, excused that Angharad had been giving offense so regularly that others now expected it of her.

That the dishonor had crept up on her unseen did not unmake it, but that was not even the part she was chewing on. How did one make reparations for such a thing? Offering courtesy going forward was ending a wrong, not making a right. Monetary reparations were an acceptable manner for a lady to extend an apology to one lowborn, but Angharad was now only titled by courtesy. Such reparations might rightly be considered putting on airs. A service, then, or some manner of boon. The Pereduri would have to ponder what ceiling should be appended to such an offer – death, wound, first blood?

It was vexing that Father’s lessons on giving justice to common folk had been as their liege lady, not an associate. Then again, how many peers of Peredur had ever been placed in a position to call lowborn folk their associate?

While frowning at the stone pavement, Angharad had finished most of what she packed away as a snack – salted fish and a few cherry tomatoes – without noticing by the time footsteps had her looking up. What awaited had her wiping away her frown, but her stomach did not unclench: Captain Imani Langa was no soothing sight, accompanied by a stranger or not.

The Malani was just as lovely in the cut of a standard uniform as she had been in her more fashionable one – she filled it just as enticingly – and today her hair was worn in long intricate braids that formed waves. She was still smiling that mysterious smile, which Angharad found to her distress was made no less enticing by the knowledge Imani Langa was an agent of the Lefthand House. She made herself look at the companion instead.

That man, Angharad decided after a heartbeat, what Tristan would be if the Sacromontan mold that made him was filled with deadliness instead of charm. The Lierganen was of the same height as her cabalmate, as messily dark-haired and though he was grim where Tristan was all smiles and the eyes were brown instead of gray they were restless in that same casual, lying way. This one, though, he was leanly muscled and his face was marred by a cross scar on the chin. He had the calluses of bladework on his palms and a worn side-sword at his hip.

Angharad had known enough of the breed to say he moved like a killer, and a seasoned one at that.

“Lady Angharad,” Imani smiled. “What a pleasant turn to find you here.”

The noblewoman set aside the last of her meal and rose, clearing her throat.

“Captain Imani,” she replied. “The pleasure is all mine.”

The lovely spy offered her hand to kiss, and it would have been terribly impolite to refuse so she gently pressed her lips against the knuckles. Once more she raised her eyes to a slightly widened smile, which she took more pleasure in than she should have. Imani withdrew her hand, then turned to half-face the third.

“I thought I might introduce one of my cabalists to you,” she said.

The dark-haired man nodded a curt greeting.

“Salvador,” he said.

His Antigua had the same lilt to it as Tristan’s, Angharad thought. He must be Sacromontan as well.

“Angharad Tredegar,” she replied. “Thirteenth Brigade.”

“Alas, you refused Thando’s invitation to change that,” Captain Imani lightly deplored. “I must confess I introduce Salvador to you with an ulterior motive, my lady – he is a Skiritai as well, you see, and I must leave him behind now to head off to my own class.”

The lovely spy touched her wrist.

“He is quite shy, so I thought to leave him here to wait in good hands.”

Salvador leveled his captain with a glare that was not particularly shy but then he sighed.

“I would appreciate company,” the dark-haired man said.

“That I can provide,” Angharad said, giving him a nod he returned.

However halting the man’s conversation, it would be better than continuing to stew in her own thoughts.

“I am grateful for the kindness,” Captain Imani said, smiling in relief. “Though I fear I must now impose on your manners, for I have pressing business on Hostel Street.”

“I would not detain you, then,” Angharad gallantly replied.

“Oh, but you must,” Imani smirked. “Simply not right now. Do come by when you have the time, Angharad. I still lodge at the Emerald Vaults, you need only ask for me in front.”

The stark reminder of what it meant that Imani Langa was an ufudupoured cold water on anything that smirk and implication might have stirred in her. The other woman was not inviting her for a rendezvous but to incite her to steal from the Watch on the behalf of the Lefthand House – for though the High Queen had asserted what was being sought belonged to her and so it must be true, the Watch might well feel differently and Angharad had sworn oaths to them.

She simply nodded, leaving the conversation to die, and Captain Imani sashayed away as suddenly as she had come. Angharad turned, meeting Salvador’s brown eyes and impassive face, then swallowed.

“Fine weather today,” she tried. “Good for walking.”

The Lierganen cocked an eyebrow ever so slightly, and it occurred to the noblewoman a moment too late that the weather on Tolomontera was, in fact, dictated by Grand Orrery on a set cycle. Alas, none of the cracks between the paving stones were large enough for her to disappear inside and die.

“Angharad, there you are!”

The Pereduri turned to see Shalini Goel striding her way, and silently swore one day she would return this great favor. The curvy Someshwari was armed to the teeth, bearing four pistols and a straight double-edged at her hip – a vaal, Angharad remembered they were called. Nobles and captains of the southern Someshwar dueled using them. They were distinguished from the common aruval billhook blades by being used only to spill blood in battle, never to cut through underbrush.

Angharad thought it strange that Shalini would be trained in such a weapon when she had no noble name to defend, until it occurred to her she might have been trained to use it on Ishaan’s behalf. She felt a pang of pity for the other woman’s loss, which tainted her smile as Shalini nearly bowled the both of them over coming to a halt.

“What were you doing hiding by a statue?” Shalini asked, then shook her head. “No matter, I still found you. Who’s this?”

Angharad cleared her throat.

“Salvador, may I present to you Shalini Goel of the Thirty-First Brigade,” she said. “She is a fellow Skiritai.”

“Pleasure to meet you,” Shalini said.

“Shalini, may I present to you Salvador of the Eleventh Brigade.”

The Lierganen grunted and gave a nod. Angharad sent her friend a look that was just short of pleading.

“Not a great talker, are you?” Shalini amusedly said.

Salvador shook his head.

“Throat,” he said.

Ah. A condition, then, and not simply his natural disposition.

“Sounds unpleasant,” the Someshwari said. “But worry not, I can speak for two.”

“Modest of you,” Angharad noted.

Shalini rolled her eyes.

“Islanders, they always think they’re funny,” she told Salvador. “Mine keeps making these quips about how Tianxi teas must ‘all taste equal under Heaven’ so our cabalmate is this close to just pressing a pillow over his face while he sleeps.”

Salvador snorted, then coughed into his fist.

“Imani says she will raise our allowance if we’re good,” he sympathized.

The treachery of the continental peoples of Vesper, well documented by the pages of history, was ever a burden on the greatness of the Kingdom of Malan. The noblewoman packed away the last of her salted fish with due dignity, amused to hear Shalini wish she had remembered to pack something to snack on as well. Angharad had not, in fact, remembered this.

Song had reminder her that unless she wanted to go back and forth between their cottage and Scholomance alone – a risky proposition – then she would be left to wait by the school gates for some time and should perhaps bring something to eat or read. Angharad had not thought to acquire books yesterday, so she had settled for something to nibble on instead.

The three of them headed out onto the square where they had been instructed to wait, finding the press of students long gone. Now it was only the Skiritai that were left, told as they were to wait before the gates of Scholomance for their covenant-appointed teacher to come and fetch them. The students stood around in small groups, chatting quietly – as if Scholomance’s shadow might take offense otherwise – and Angharad let her eyes stray. She recognized few faces here, though some stood out.

Lord Musa Shange was there, surrounded by others and carefully ignoring her existence as he conversed with a slender Someshwari. Muchen He from the Forty-Ninth was there as well and keeping a watch on that wolf-eyed boy from Tupoc’s cabal. ‘Expendable’, she believed? He was one of the rare students standing alone, his gaze almost never leaving the ground.

“At least sixty of us here,” Shalini said.

“More,” Salvador said, but nodded.

“I thought there might be more of us than that,” Angharad admitted. “It seems to me no cabal should be without a Skiritai.”

“Not everyone’s making a fighting company,” Shalini pointed out. “I know Ferranda in-”

The curvy gunslinger was interrupted, but not by another’s words: the clarion call that cut through was no metaphor but the actual sound of two clarion trumpets being sounded. Poorly. Angharad watched with something like disbelief as a pair of gaudily attired boys, neither older than thirteen and each wearing enough ribbons and frippery for a whole salon, crossed one of the bridges leading to Scholomance before moving to the sides.

The taller of the two, ruddy-cheeked and bright-eyed, cleared his throat as somewhere in the vicinity of sixty heavily armed students stared him down.

“Now announcing His Grace,” the boy called out. “Marshal Hermenegildo Berenguel Adamastor de la Tavarin, Count of Encoberto.”

The other boy whispered at him.

“Retired,” the page hastily tacked on.

Silence followed. The announced man was nowhere in sight.

Angharad was left in the uncomfortable position of hoping this was some manner of prank. Besides, were blackcloaks not sworn to renounce their titles when they put on the black? This Marshal de la Tavarin should no longer be a count.

“Wait, if he’s retired can he still call himself a marshal?” Shalini frowned.

Angharad blinked.

“I… think not?” she slowly said.

Had the Watch somehow been tricked by a charlatan? That was most distressing. The page boys had been shuffling on their feet, discomforted by the weight of the stares, but when they suddenly straightened Angharad glanced past them and finally saw the approaching professor.

The man was Lierganen and old, perhaps the oldest man Angharad had ever seen. He walked leaning on a brass lionhead cane, back slightly curbed, and his face was tanned and creased like old leather. Though there was still some touch of black to his eyebrows, it was his impressive pure white mustache and equally snowy long locks that commanded attention. For a heartbeat, anyway, as the old ‘Marshal’ was most eye searingly dressed.

Though his knee-length coat was Watch black, its sleeves were pinned back and vivid yellow with flashing silver buttons. His trousers and hose were pristine and white, matching his overlarge cravat, and his delicate doeskin shoes were better fit for a ballroom than the street. His hat was wide-brimmed and embroidered in silver, not that one would notice considering the almost absurd size of the yellow feather pinned back on it.

His slow, unhurried advance set the students to murmuring. Salvador let out a small noise of surprise, earning her attention.

“Farfan,” he said.

Angharad hid her bemusement behind a pleasant smile. Thankfully Shalini knew what he meant.

“Farfanes are mercenaries,” she explained. “Their companies fight out in Old Liergan for whoever will pay, even hollows. Fine soldiers, I heard, who see more blood on the regular than anyone save the Izcalli.”

The Pereduri was rather curious as to how a girl from Ramaya – near as far from Old Liergan was it was possible to be and still live within the borders of the Imperial Someshwar – had come to know of such hired swords, but this was no time to ask. With an entirely unnecessary flourish of his cane the old man came to a stop and cleared his throat once. He got the silence he had not quite asked for.

He opened his mouth to speak, but whatever he was saying was drowned out by the sound of the page boys sounding their clarions again. They both stared at him expectantly afterwards, and after a moment the old man sighed and flipped them a golden coin. They put down the clarions and ran off without a second glance, chattering excitedly.

There was a sudden epidemic of coughing fits among the students, which some might have interpreted as poorly suppressed laughter.

“You may call me Marshal,” the old man announced in weathered voice, “or Your Grace. I have been charged by the Skiritai Guild to make something useful out of you.”

Angharad eyed him skeptically. Under the formal etiquette of the Second Empire, which most of the Lierganen states still followed, the proper address for a count was ‘Your Excellency’. Though he was not claiming the courtesy due a higher title, in a way it was even worse: ‘Your Grace’ was not, as far as she knew, even a Lierganen address. She vaguely thought it might have been used in the ancient Kingdom of Cathay, but it had fallen somewhat out of vogue around the same time Cathayan nobles keeping their heads became similarly unpopular.

“Follow,” the Marshal idly ordered, and with another flourish of his cane turned about.

The old man began crossing the bridge anew, and after a heartbeat of hesitation students began to follow. Angharad shared a look with Shalini, who shrugged.

They followed.

—

They had been told to gather at the Old Playhouse by the fifteenth hour but Song knew within moments they were not to stay there.

The great structure was simply too large and empty to serve properly as either a classroom or salon. Oh, the Old Playground could likely be pressed into such service if there was need. But was there? Song doubted it. The Academy was the largest and the wealthiest of the covenants – in absolute numbers, if not comparatively – and if the Navigators had been able to afford a chapterhouse in Port Allazei then the Stripes were sure to have their equivalent.

Something in a better state than this ancient theater, which had weathered the years impressively but was still very much a ruin.

Still, she allowed herself some time to study the grounds where an evening had taken place she had not attended. There were few traces left of the festivities, little more than lines of ripped earth in the grass and swaths of recently cleaned stone contrasting to the natural grime of the rest, but she could imagine the lay of it all. The pavilions, tables and torches, the way the guests would be incited to mingle on the bottom floor but there would be room for private walks in the lodges-turned-garden. It would have been a lovely evening, no doubt, and her eyes would have gained many useful insights.

But the Ren name would not have fit through that door.

Instead of lingering on that unpleasant reality, Ren picked out one of the prettier lodges for herself. A stone railing behind a stretch of grass and fragrant red flowers, perched on the ring nearest the bottom while moderately distant from the stairs leading there. She had arrived at twenty before three but found half a dozen students still preceded her. Captain Philani from that same morning was one, so she detoured to trade polite greetings. The captain Thirty-Eight Brigade was polite and welcoming but there was no warmth to it so she did not linger.

It was Song’s duty to make alliances with other captains so that the many rivals of the Thirteenth would take pause at the enmity aggression would earn them, but the Thirty-Eighth was not high in the list of candidates – she was satisfied with having established Captain Philani was not hostile to her even when Angharad was no longer there to impress.

Song had been of the early birds but by the time she returned to her lodge numbers had begun trickling in. Many headed down to the bottom floor, where the playhouse stage lay, and began chatting there. It would not have been a bad time to begin making connections, as some captains were doing before her very eyes, but the Tianxi had her reasons to hold back. Given the number of enemies the Thirteenth already boasted she should get the lay of the land before wading in, and even beyond that it was her personal preference to favor quality over quantity.

Better even a single skilled, reliable ally than a gaggle of fair-weather friends.

She was approached in her lodge by Captain Anaya of the Twenty-Third – leader of the Malani boy who’d broken the ice during Mandate class by answering first – and found herself delicately probed by the grim-faced Someshwari. It took a moment for Song to be certain what the other woman trying to find out, but when she did she made sure to immediately give it.

“Of course, we all carry our enemies with us. One of my own cabalists nearly dueled Tupoc Xical to the death on the Dominion of Lost Things,” Song idly said.

Captain Anaya frowned, but not in displeasure. She was, as far as Song could tell, simply a natural frowner.

“A singularly unpleasant man,” the Someshwari said.

“That is the only reliable thing about him,” Song agreed. “I would not wish an alliance with him on my worst enemies.”

Captain Anaya made her excuses soon after that, leaving the silver-eyed captain amused. Tupoc had made enemies of the Twenty-Third Brigade, at least enough that its captain would approach Song to ascertain where the Thirteenth would stand if conflict erupted. Playing this like Dominion trials will get you killed, Xical, she thought. Not that she was inclined to help him by saying as much.

By the time the trickle of arrivals tapered off entirely there were precisely sixty students present, including herself, and that simply had to be a quota.

And with the last arrivals came a second visitor. Her study of where the pieces were falling was interrupted by the sound of boots on grass, the Tianxi turning with a pleasant greeting smile – only to find Ferranda Villazur looking back with an amused look.

“Song,” she said, nodding.

A single strand of blonde hair had come loose from her bun, which Song had to force herself not to mention.

“Ferranda,” she replied instead. “You are cutting it close.”

It should be mere minutes now before the appointed time came to pass. The infanzona stepped forward to lean against the stone balustrade by Song’s side.

“I went and had a look at where the Umuthi Society hole up for their classes,” Ferranda said. “The Tinkers have a proper workshop tucked away to the east of the docks, it was quite surprising.”

Song inclined her head, acknowledging the gift, and returned it in kind.

“They are not alone in having such luxuries at hand. The Navigators have a chapterhouse close to Hostel Street.”

A thoughtful hum.

“It must have cost a fortune to rebuild Port Allazei so it would be habitable beyond the garrison barracks,” Ferranda said. “And quite a bit of time as well. I wonder how long the Watch has been planning all this.”

And why, she did not say out loud. That they all wondered, because the answer would shed a great deal of light on what the future held for them all. Why had the Watch opened the ancient, murderous school anew? There must be a reason, a plan or a need. The two of them remained comfortably silent after that, eyes on the unfolding alliances below.

And Ferranda was quite noticeably not leaving.

They both knew that was a statement to anyone who cared to look, which was nearly every captain on Tolomontera.

“Are you certain?” Song simply asked.

“That Musa prick won’t lay off Zenzele just because Angharad trounced him once,” Ferranda pragmatically replied. “My enmity with the Ninth isn’t up to debate, just the precise degree of it. Together we don’t look nearly as soft a target.”

“You could come to an accord with the Third,” Song lightly said.

The fair-haired infanzona rolled her eyes.

“So I can become Captain Nenetl’s stalking horse in getting rid of Sebastian Camaron?” she replied. “I must decline that honor, same as you.”

Song smiled. One clever ally was worth ten.

“They have been so open about their rivalry I have wondered if it is feigned,” she admitted.

“Oh, I can tell you she genuinely hates his guts,” Ferranda said. “I had them together once at a captain’s council and it was quite an experience. There’s just no way that sheer amount of petty spite was faked.”

That was good to know, and once more reinforced the use of attending such a council. Song inquired when the next one might take place and was told the schedule was not yet decided but that she would be informed as soon as it was. The pair, now solidly and openly in the same boat, then set to picking out the currents around them.

Familiar faces abounded. Song had been glared at by Captain Tengfei of the Forty-Ninth earlier while his would-be replacement Ramona waved cheerily instead – she’d nodded back, intending to make peace with the brigade if the opportunity came. Tupoc had blown through and was now displaying an unexpected capacity for conversation not involving insults by entertaining two Izcalli students with a fast-paced story that had them both laughing loudly.

But these were small fish, and there were whales in the water: down below, on the bottom floor, three rival courts had formed.

Captain Sebastian Camaron of the Ninth presided over the largest, over a dozen students mingling around him. Song committed their faces to memory, knowing them for possible tools she might have to face. One of them she thought might match Abrascal’s description of Captain Imani Langa but the silver-eyed Tianxi held out hope she was wrong. If she was not, prying Angharad away from the charms of such a sultry beauty was going to be a long and thankless labor. It was Ruesta all over again, only more dangerous for the new woman’s lack of general uselessness.

To put a name to the leading figure of the second-largest gathering, the strongest rival to Sebastian Camaron’s, she required the help of Ferranda.

“That’s Captain Vivek Lahiri of the First Brigade,” the infanzona said.

The captain had a contract, Song noted, and one of the longest she had ever seen – the equivalent of pages of text in what appeared to be Samratrava. She was itching to have a better look.

“Background?” she asked.

“The way I hear it he’s got relatives in every Someshwari free company worth remembering the name of,” Ferranda said.

“So we have one princeling from the free companies and the other from the closest regional seat of the Garrison,” Song said. “That reeks of blackpowder.”

The most powerful of the free companies would have ordered their children to band together and edge out the Garrison students – the other way around being likely true as well, though accounting for internal enmities in both branches of the Watch. Now that Scholomance was open again everyone had an interest in securing the school. Even setting aside whatever secret design there was for this place, simply dominating an institution that would make covenanters by the literal hundreds was something worth a sea of gold.

“They’re steering clear of each other for now,” the infanzona said. “Though that won’t last. Sooner or later one of will want to show they have the biggest stick and they’re the boy king of Allazei.”

Song hummed.

“And then trailing behind them,” she said, “we have our old friend from the Third.”

Captain Nenetl Chaputl of the Third Brigade, her delicate features atop a rotund silhouette difficult to mistake for another’s, had gathered a court of her own. It was noticeably smaller than either of the other contenders’, however, and of lesser quality as well.

“She’s picking up the leftovers from both the free companies and the Garrison,” Ferranda noted. “It’s halfway clever, but it will only get her so far.”

They had not been the first picks of the greater forces for a reason, and Captain Nenetl would not have as convincing a banner to wave to keep them behind her as the other two did. Still, the position was hardly bad. For now.

“She only needs to last with some degree of prominence until Camaron stumbles, then she can usurp the parts of his faction she can use,” Song said.

It would be a delicate line for her to walk until then, however, juggling such disparate interests. And if Sebastian Camaron did not stumble on his own, she must arrange for him to trip or see her position wither on the vine. Only the most foolish of gamblers kept backed a losing horse. Still, in the end between them the three leading captains had barely half the sixty students gathered below. Many of the captains had come down to pay their respects but were now keeping their distance and would for months still.

A sudden quiet below, the courts turning quiet in a heartbeat, drew her gaze and Ferranda’s. They saw the reason for it in an instant: their professor had arrived.

“Up.”

The order was clear, crisp, and it sent every student who had come to the bottom floor hurrying back up to the first ring.

It had come out of a Tianxi’s mouth, a woman in her late forties cutting a sharp figure in her formal uniform. She was short, Song thought, and her face plain. Yet she had presence, piercing eyes that straightened backs wherever they passed and her look was only strengthened by the austere bun she wore her hair in. The red silk scarf worn in a knot around her collar was the sole departure from the traditional uniform, which was finely made but very functional.

The professor came to a halt at the end of the stage, the sword and pistol at her hip glinting dully under the pale Orrery lights.

“My name is Colonel Chunhua Cao,” she said. “I was sent here by the Academy to bring you up to an acceptable standard before you graduate Scholomance.”

Colonel Cao pitcher her voice to carry.

“My qualifications for teaching you are as follows: I have served under both free companies and Garrison forces.”

Her stare continued sweeping across the crowd.

“I held a frontline command during the general Watch muster called to suppress Loving Kiss and went on to serve as field officer during both the Long Burn and Sordan War. I was a named negotiator at the Peace of Concordia and dictated terms of surrender at the siege of Yueliang Shan.”

The Peace of Concordia, Song knew, was the treaty that had put an end to the Sordan War. As for the siege mentioned it had to be part of the Red Rice Rebellion, when a bandit cult in the Sanxing had risen in revolt at the urging of a conspiracy of mountain gods. Their hidden fortresses were said to have offered brutal resistance long past the cause being lost.

“Of the ten highest decorations granted by the Academy I hold seven,” Colonel Cao stated, “and I have twice refused promotion to lieutenant-general.”

A rank that, while beneath that of marshal, would have given her a fortress to command and a seat on the Conclave to go with it.

“It has been prevailed on me to teach at this school, but I warn you now that I have no patience for lackluster effort or petty arrogance. If you fail to perform to my standards, I will see you thrown out of my class and Scholomance with it.”

A look told Song some were skeptical of that, which Colonel Cao noticed. She offered up a cold smile.

“I have spent thirty years as an officer in the worst fires known to our order,” she said. “I am owed more favors than I know what to do with and I have buried enough bodies to fill a lichyard. By all means, write to your patrons.”

She leaned forward.

“They will tell you the same thing I do now: step out of line and I will have you on the next ship out of Port Allazei.”

This time even the princelings knew better than to show doubt. Silence stretched, until finally Colonel Cao nodded in satisfaction.

“That will do,” she said. “You may now come down. I will show you the way to the Academy’s seat on the island. Do not dawdle and be certain to commit the path to memory – I will not show it to you again.”

A fire burned in Song’s belly, not at the thought of the lodge or even the first class: it was the teacher that had her thrumming with enthusiasm, much as she tried to hide it.

How could she not be excited, when it seemed she was going to be taught by a woman who was everything that she wanted to be?

# Chapter 15

The Chimerical was open, not that Tristan had ever seen it close. Did devils even sleep?

“Oh, this place again,” Fortuna enthused. “I just love that hanging crocodile, you should see if it’s for sale.”

He would not, in fact, be doing this. Tristan snuck a look sideways at the goddess, who was traipsing around in her red dress and by all appearances in a fine mood.

“You do not mind the inside, then?” he asked.

Maryam had looked like someone freshly socked in the stomach when recounting how she’d tried to use Gloam sorcery inside. He would have thought Fortuna just as vulnerable to the eldritch trap Hage had lain within. The Lady of Long Odds laid a finger on her chin.

“The drapes could do with some dusting,” she mused.

Not what he had meant, which she knew very well.

“So it isn’t like the Witching Hour,” he said. “It cannot make you disappear.”

Fortuna rolled his eyes at him.

“I wander off for a walk and suddenly you begin clutching at my skirts,” she said. “Tristan, darling, this is growing into somewhat of an embarrassment.”

His jaw clenched. Lying. She was lying about it again. No matter how much he pressed Fortuna refused to acknowledge that when he had wandered the layer she had been gone. Her insistence that she had merely been wandering around was a lazy, transparent lie that she forced into holding by simply ignoring him when he called it out. It was incredibly frustrating, and not at all in the way that Fortuna usually frustrated him.

Forcing himself to calm, Tristan walked the last dozen feet to the front of the coffeehouse. The thief did not wipe his boots on the welcome mat, which was more filth than straw, and struggled to force open the old oaken door. He was fairly sure part of the top rail was either swelled by humidity or too large for the door frame, because it needed fighting on both the way in and the way out. After a minute of effort, he gave up the job and left the door only nine tenths closed.

The acrid smell of coffee remained unpleasant and, even worse, the kind of odor that stuck to your clothes afterwards. Hard to sneak on someone when they smelled an approaching coffeehouse the moment you stood upwind. That audaciously fat black cat – Mephistofeline, he must admit the devil had fine naming sense – waddled close, rubbing his side against Tristan’s boots and then looking up expectantly.

“Your Majesty,” he greeted, scratching under the ears. “How fares your claim on Pandemonium?”

Mephistofeline purred, then sat on his boot and let out an expectant meow. Tristan had always liked cats, their unfortunate tendency to eat rats notwithstanding. They could take care of themselves, which he’d always respected. Though not enough to get one as a pet, as only a fool grew attached to a creature wandering the Murk.

There were never a lot of strays on the streets of the Murk, but especially few the week after rents were due.

“I do not have food,” the thief informed the cat.

Mephistofeline rolled around on his boot, batting his feet up, then meowed again as if that display might have magically added fish to Tristan’s pockets.

“Still no,” he said.

Either miffed at the lack of reward or satisfied he had charmed a new subject into vassalage, the black cat wobbled away with a swinging tail. There was no way Hage had not heard him play with the cat, so he should be out from wherever he usually hid. Tristan’s gaze swept through the booths and the counter, the cluttered display of knickknacks and-

The front door slammed shut and he nearly jumped out of his skin, biting his lip until it almost bled.

Hage had somehow gotten past him without his notice and now stood behind him, faintly smiling. The devil’s shell had not changed a whit – all tall limbs and owlish eyebrows squeezed in a fashionable jerkin and doublet and a rust-red cap – but now that he knew what to look for Tristan thought the brown eyes a little off. Too flat, and when they moved it almost felt like something was looking through them.

“I have always enjoyed cats,” Hage mused. “It is the shameless disloyalty, I think. There is not a single example of the breed that would not turn on you for a large enough salmon.”

“Proper royalty, then,” Tristan said.

“Finer than most,” Hage smiled, revealing the teeth behind the teeth. “He would require salmon first, at least.”

Despite himself, Tristan tensed when the devil stepped past him on his way back to the counter – nearly brushing his shoulder but not quite. He could not forget that evening in Cantica, how damnably quickeven those young devils had been. How their strength had splintered wood and pulped flesh, like the world around them was made of parchment. Hage would not kill him, he knew.

But if he wanted to, it would be as easy as reaching out and squeezing.

“If you’ve come to order water again, boy, you will find each cup is a full arbol,” Hage informed him.

The thief swallowed his discomfort, spread it out until its weave thinned into nothing, and put on a smile. Fortuna, he noted, had ignored all this and pursued the retreating Mephistofeline whose princely hide had committed the great sin of ignoring an invisible, intangible being. He slid into one of the high seats by the counter, calmed by the sight idly noting several of the copper pots were full of water with lit flames beneath. None at a boil, but close.

“What would you advise,” he said, “for someone who has never had coffee before?”

“Another shop,” Hage drily replied.

But the devil withdrew a step, bending to reach for a cloth bag beneath the counter.

“Espuma azul,” he said. “The way they take it on the Riven Coast, short with a layer of berry syrup.”

That sounded absolutely atrocious but Tristan pretended otherwise with a pleased smile. He had no intention of drinking coffee beyond what circumstance forced on him, regardless, so he thought of the cost more as the price paid for a conversation. He slid the seven coppers – Manes, that was almost two meals – Hage asked him for across the counter, which the devil snapped up dexterously before getting about the business of making the promised abomination.

Mephistofeline leaped up onto the counter, drawn by the noise, and drew Fortuna back with him. The black cat stretched and settled for a map like a plump furry cushion, purring happily when Hage scratched his head. Still visibly miffed at having been ignored, Fortuna began peering at all the copper devices behind the counter while the devil poured beans into a mortar and began crushing them. The goddess spared him a glance.

“Now that’s an old one,” she noted. “And not too empty inside either.”

Tristan kept his face smooth. Empty inside? Putting a meaning to that would be more work than he could afford at the moment, so best to keep to the shallow truths. Hage was old even by Fortuna’s reckoning, which meant the devil was almost certain to be annealed. Immortal in the sense that no matter how many times he was killed he would come back.

“I had not thought to see you again,” Hage idly said as he pressed the pestle against the coffee beans. “You did not seem keen on trying my brews.”

“Well,” Tristan said, “I had a thought.”

“It was bound to happen eventually,” the devil said. “Worry not, boy, the headache will pass.”

He rolled his eyes even as Fortuna chortled at his expense.

“It seems to me like the Krypteia would balk at putting all its recommendations in the same room, where anyone could see them and commit the faces to memory,” Tristan said. “Besides, though I confess I know little of the Masks their remit as told me is large.”

Abuela had told him the Krypteia were charged with killing traitors within the Watch, but the Cryptics were also supposed to be spies sniffing out cultists and those breaking the Accords as well as interrogators and assassins. Compared to the duty of the Skiritai Guild, which as far as he could tell began and ended with the sentence ‘kill things’, it was a generous helping of responsibilities. Too many, perhaps, for a single set of skills to apply across the entire Krypteia.

“Enough that many teachers might serve better than one,” he continued.

The devil, done with crushing the beans, carefully poured the powder into now-boiling water.

“A reasoning not without cleverness,” Hage said. “Though if you think to buy names from me, it will not be cheap.”

The thief had considered that, as it happened, but it wasn’t why he was here.

“It seems to me,” Tristan continued, “that if the Masks planted teachers there must be some way to find them out. To confirm they truly are one.”

“It would make for a pointless chase otherwise,” Hage agreed.

“The simplest way,” he said, “would be to order them not to lie when asked.”

Tristan leaned in.

“Are you a teacher for the Krypteia, Hage?”

The devil chuckled.

“So I am,” he said. “What led you to suspect?”

“You got the drop on all of us when we first visited,” Tristan said.

As far as he could tell, Song could see through anything aetheric – including the existence of contracts – and she had still missed him. Tredegar had been caught unaware, and unless she was busy brooding that girl was damnably difficult to slip by.

“That and Wen implied the Chimerical has existed elsewhere,” he added. “Put that together, and your being a devil on a Watch island? There are only so many explanations.”

Even if Hage had not turned out to be a professor, he was almost certain to be some sort of lead.

“Wen has always been too chatty for his own good,” Hage said. “His time on the Dominion has done nothing to mend the flaws that saw him sent there.”

A tempting morsel to nibble at, Tristan thought, but he knew bait when he heard it.

“What do you teach?” he asked. “How many of them are you?”

Hage sighed, stirring the copper pot. He clicked his teeth disapprovingly, the sound too long and drawn out for it to have been men’s teeth.

“Creepy,” Fortuna appreciated.

She leaned forward to look into the devil’s mouth as he spoke, like a buyer inspecting a horse’s teeth, and Tristan almost twitched.

“There are five of us on Tolomontera,” Hage said. “To be allowed to remain at Scholomance, you must find two of us and learn a trade to our satisfaction before the end of the year.”

Tristan frowned.

“And your trade is?”

The devil turned and glanced back.

“What do you think?” he asked.

The thief narrowed his eyes.

“I think that coffee would cover the smell of strange brews and your devices to make it the sound of more exotic distillations,” Tristan said.

“I teach poisons,” Hage agreed.

Too easily.

“But not just that,” the gray-eyed man added, frowning. “Spycraft? Things can be overheard in a coffeehouse and you have the only one on the island. Officers will chat here, loosen their tongues.”

Not as much as they would when drunk, but you drink wine in your own home. Coffee was much harder to obtain, and a popular vice among the wealthy.

“The Chimerical has been many sorts of establishments over the years,” Hage said. “Coffee is only the latest of my fascinations.”

The devil, deeming the boiling finished, stole away the copper pot and busied himself out of sight. The process involved filtering, vapor released from a valve and what looked like a leathery pastry bag. Tristan was served a cup of coffee taller than wide, no larger than his thumb, the liquid’s surface was layered with a purple-blue syrup slowly turning into foam.

“Pretty,” Fortuna opined.

“Wait twenty seconds, then sip,” Hage instructed, then cocked one of the great eyebrows. “You may learn from me, Tristan Abrascal, either the art of poisons or the liar’s game – what we call the ‘lesser tradecraft’, these days.”

“Spying,” he said.

“We are all spies, boy,” Hage chuckled. “The liar’s game is the one played on your feet: picking locks, doubling papers, twisting arms and hunting down rumors.”

Tristan cocked his head to the side.

“Would that not be the greater tradecraft?” he asked.

Hage gave a twofold smile, which had grown no less disturbing for the repetition.

“Liars are a spent like coppers,” he said. “The greatest of our craft move the board, not on it.”

Unsure what one might reply to that, Tristan tried a sip of the drink to buy himself time.

It was, to his surprise, quite good.

He had expected something sugary and warm, like a pie made into liquid, but instead the drink was quite bitter. Yet it was also refreshing, the aftertaste of the berry syrup smoothing out the tang of the beans. Not something he would partake of for pleasure, but hardly the chore he had expected to be putting himself through.

“It is to be drunk quickly,” Hage said, “before the syrup is entirely thinned by the heat.”

Tristan took another sip, considering his option. The devil had implied he would only offer tutelage in one trade, and in truth that was for the best – he still needed to find another of the teachers hidden in Port Allazei, which would take time. One trade was best, keeping that in mind. Which left the question of which he should take.

Neither felt like it quite fit, in truth. Abuela had made him learn Alvareno’s Dosages and its uses, so he was passable in the use of poisons already. No expert, certainly, but Tristan had picked the elective class of Medicine and he expected that there would be some bridges in that knowledge. On the other hand, he knew precious little of the sort of exotic substances that would be required to kill the likes of devils and gods. And he was unlikely to ever be killing the likes of those with a blade, wasn’t he?

Lesser tradecraft sounded a great deal like what Abuela had been training him in since she took him under her wing, and it felt almost insulting that he should be trained in something he had been doing all his life. Pride aside, it was in such matters he felt most confident. Yet it was one thing to practice these skills and another to practice them the ways the Krypteia wanted him to. It would, besides, be arrogance to expect that his few years of tutelage were all there was to know.

Tristan took another sip and considered what it was he would most be called on to do on behalf of the Thirteenth. That was his answer, in the end.

“I have been known to dabble in lying,” he told Hage. “It is a fitting game for me to learn, I think.”

The devil seemed amused.

“Ah, the hardest of my tests,” he said. “As expected of the Name-Eater’s latest.”

“A test,” Tristan warily repeated.

“Did you think we would teach anyone who asked?” Hage said, clicking something that was not a tongue and did not sound like it. “No, first you must prove worth my while.”

“And how,” the thief said, “would I do that?”

“Simple enough,” the devil replied. “The Watch keeps a dossier on all students who attend Scholomance. There are four transcripts of yours in Port Allazei: before midnight, read one and return to answer my questions on its contents.”

Tristan mulled on that, for a moment, then cleared his throat.

“Might I read your transcript?” he politely asked.

“No,” Hage replied.

The hard way it was, then.

“Welcome to the Abbey.”

Professor Baltasar Formosa’s hair had not grown any less wild since Maryam last saw him, or his beard any less neatly cropped, but the tall middle-aged man looked as haggard as they all felt. Standing on the edge of the depthless pit of darkness, framed only by shaky candlelight of the chamberstick he was holding up, the professor looked more scarecrow than man. The silver signet ring on his hand, the mark of a Master of the Guild, glittered coldly as he gestured at the pit below.

The sixty of them had followed him deep below the Akelarre chapterhouse, handed worn iron chambersticks and sent down narrow stairs where only one fit at a time. The great room waiting beneath the ground was an intricate pattern of arching pillars and transverses, the gray and red tile patterns on the ceiling dizzying to the eye even in the trembling glow of their candles.

But all their eyes had inevitably strayed to the heart of the room, where the pit breathed like a gargantuan beast.

Professor Baltasar had led them to the edge, where a well of darkness plunged into the depths of the earth, but tucked away were further secrets. Spiraling down and facing the dark were small stone cells, large enough to fit one soul and little more. Maryam tried not to look down, where the dark became Gloam and the depths of nothingness would swallow whole the unwary.

“We did not build this place,” Professor Baltasar said. “Unlike much of this island it does not bear the mark of the Antediluvians, so our best guess is that it was dug during the Old Night.”

Maryam believed him. She had walked the shrine path below the Broken Gates as a girl, to prove she was worthy of being taught by her mother, and the oldest of the shrines – built after the Antediluvians unmade themselves by shattering the walls encircling Nav – had the same… feeling to them than this place. Not winter-cold but grave-cold, the kind that left the skin cool but settled deep in your bones.

“Many a cult and court have held the Abbey over the centuries,” the professor continued, “and always for the same reason: it is one of the single finest places in all the known world to educate signifiers.”

Whispers spread between shivering candles, eager and wary both. The Craft was not something that ever gave without taking.

“The Gloam here is malleable, settled,” Baltasar Formosa said. “You will find it easier to form Signs and should you stumble you will find it easier to cut the Sign before it lashes back.”

So that was how the Guild would get around the strictures of teaching the Craft.

To form a Sign was to paint with fire: the smallest of mistakes would see your fingers scorched. All it took for backlash to happen was to fail to fit the Gloam into the Sign strongly enough. Tendrils of power would surge out, like with waterskin being gripped, and mangle everything around them. If you lacked discipline, losing a finger would make you release the incomplete Sign out of pain and then you were likely to lose an entire hand – if not an arm.

Most signifiers only learned Signs under the eye of an elder of the Craft for that very reason: the older Akelarre could snuff out the backlash before it hurt you, then show you where you had gone wrong. It had been greatly unlikely for the Akelarre Guild to send sixty Masters to teach the students at Scholomance, however, given how much their services were worth. Even a more reasonable split of five students per Master would have represented a ruinous expense. But if the Abbey made mistakes more forgiving, learning easier? A handful of teachers would be enough. More guides than mentors, which seemed the way of things at Scholomance.

“I teach you nothing you do not know when I say that the Art is not something that can be made standard,” Professor Baltasar said. “The process of obscuration is personal, and talent with certain Signs can make difficult the mastery of others.”

Standing fearless by the edge of the drop, the professor had turned his back to the dark to address them. It leant him a ghostly air, standing surrounded by a circle of flickering candlelight with the abyss lurking below.

“I will not pretend otherwise by teaching you as a crowd: you will learn as you please, according to your understanding of your strengths.,” Professor Baltasar said. “The chapterhouse library will be made open to you, but no book within will be forced.”

It could not only that, Maryam thought, for to be left to their own devices when learning Signs would be… hazardous, regardless of the Abbey’s boons.”

“I and other Masters on the island will teach you Sign-patterns if asked, and smooth the wrinkles in your understanding by conversation, but that will be at your own initiative,” the professor told them. “No time in the Abbey is mandated of you, and it is your right to never return here if you so wish.”

You showed us the long length of the leash, Maryam thought. Now how are you going to tug it to remind us it is still very much there?

“But at the end of the year,” Professor Baltasar calmly said, “any of you who have not mastered the fundamental Signs of at least two of the five branches of the Art to my satisfaction will be sent away.”

His gaze turned disdainful.

“If you are incapable of accomplishing this with the advantages we will offer you, to keep you here is a waste of our time.”

Maryam flinched, glad that her hood hid it. This was not glad news.

“Now,” Professor Baltasar mildly, “I would begin showing you the benefits of studying at Scholomance. Can anyone here name the Two Measures?”

Hands rose, though not Maryam’s. She was still chewing over mounting despair.

“Grasp and Command, professor.”

Maryam had been taught using the words Grip and Control, but the meanings were the same. The Two Measures were the way by which the ‘strength’ of a signifier could be quantified, more or less. Grasp was the amount of Gloam that one’s nav was capable of gathering, the power that was there to be shape. Command was the amount of Gloam that a signifier was capable of shaping at once, usually by forming it into a Sign.

The ceiling of a signifier’s capacity lay at the intersection of these measures: the peak of what you could Grasp and Command was your peak. Having superb Command but weak Grasp meant you would be forever condemned to petty tricks, while having great Grasp but weak Command meant using any complex Sign risked melting your brain. It was very rare for someone to be perfectly matched in both, most signifiers naturally leaning one way or the other and learning to compensate.

Maryam was not one of the souls blessed with perfect metaphysical symmetry, to her great bitterness.

The Two Measures were not perfect, of course. She had been taught that some Akelarre scholars argued for other measures to be added – Extent for the time you could manipulate, for example, or Density for the concentration of Gloam that you could achieve – but there were even more arguing that such additions were ultimately derivative and should not be held up as fundamentals.

“Correct,” Professor Baltasar said. “It is rare for a precise assessment of where one stands relative to the two measures to be feasible, but the condition of the Gloam here in the Abbey allows for the use of these.”

Fishing inside his robes, the scarecrow man produced a wide, slender circle of stone no larger than two fists put together. It was engraved with intricate channels on its surface, whose patterns were dizzying to contemplate. Maryam resisted the urge to send out her nav to feel them out, knowing she was being presented with conceptual symmetry – the flesh was ill suited to contemplate such things, but the Abbey was a dangerous place to get curious with her soul-effigy.

“Some of you will recognize what I hold,” he said. “But for the rest of you: this artifact is called a Kuru Maze. It restricts the gathering and guidance of the Gloam in very specific ways, allowing for a precise measure of your Grasp and Command.”

He cleared his throat.

“Time has made such creations fragile and a significant loss of control will shatter the stone,” Professor Baltasar said. “In the Abbey, however, the risk is significantly diminished. Consequently you will be allowed to test yourself using the maze and learn where you stand regarding Grasp and Command.”

He paused.

“The value you will be given is cross-referenced in many of the books in the chapterhouse library, which should markedly ease the process of learning new Signs,” the professor continued. “As in all things, you will not be forced – it is, however, my strong recommendation that you take this test.”

There was some eager chatter. The notion was a popular one, and why not? The manipulation of Gloam was deemed the Craft by Izvorica and the Art by the Akelarre Guild because much of it was imprecise, hard to measure. The few certainties they could get their hands on were priceless things.

“Now, let us get you in your cells,” Professor Baltasar said. “I will be moving down in order to handle the maze and any questions you might have.”

Maryam’s lips thinned. She already knew she would decline use of the Kuru Maze so she should decide on a believable reason as soon as possible.

Because if Professor Baltasar saw her measures, he might well just tell her to stop coming to class.

—

They had assembled at the Old Playhouse because of a hidden path.

None of them had seen Colonel Cao arrive earlier, though given where she’d appeared Song had guessed she came from the back of the stage. This proved to be correct, though not in the way she had expected. The colonel walked past a half-collapsed corridor that must lead back to the city and instead went into the basement of the playhouse, through what must once have been some ancient storage. There waited great wooden doors, which were of much more recent make than anything else Song had seen here.

Pulled open, they revealed a narrow lantern-lit hall that continued beyond what the Tianxi could easily make out.

“The last in are to the close the doors,” Colonel Cao instructed, then proceeded in.

The hall was only wide enough for two at a time, which left Song and Ferranda side by side. The fair-haired infanzona was keeping quiet, eyes moving across the lit hall as if there might lie hidden secrets in the walls of stone. They walked behind a pair of Izcalli, the same Song recalled having seen speaking with Tupoc earlier. The two spoke in Centzon the entire way, seeming to believe using their native tongue would keep the talk private.

Unfortunately for them Song had been fluent in Centzon since she was ten years old.

Alas, the pair were not sharing great secrets. Mostly they talked about how a girl called Serinda was ‘scorching as summer heat’ and ribbed each other about how they were going to be the one to seduce her into bed. The only mildly interesting thing to come out of their mouth was a passing mention of Tupoc, whom they called ‘the leopard-man’ and did not seem to take all that seriously.

Song knew little that was not secondhand about the Leopard Society, but she recalled it was not considered prestigious the way that most Izcalli warrior societies were. That was sensible enough given that they were a pack of raiding, slave-taking bandits but she had not considered that it might lead other Izcalli to look down on Tupoc. That might be of use.

The path to their destination was simple: they went in a straight line until there was a crossroads, then took a left. Word came from the front, and thus Colonel Cao, that the right turn would lead into an alley close to the junction of Regnant Avenue and Templeward Street. Continuing north would, instead, eventually lead to Misery Square. Song memorized the former path, which promised to be the most convenient for her in the future.

At the end of the turn waited a wrought iron door, kept alight not with lanterns but by replaced stones around the doorway whose masonry had soaked in Glare and gave off that pale burn still.

“Expensive,” Ferranda murmured, and the Tianxi nodded in agreement.

The two of them were about halfway down the line and there were several people taller than them in the way, so neither could make out what Colonel Cao did before the door – but all heard her rap her knuckles harshly thrice, then a shutter slide open. Something was said, the shutter closed and after a few moments the door opened wide. The students began entering, the surprised gasps Song heard when she was close enough to stoke her curiosity.

Soon they were past the threshold and the guards by it, the Tianxi breathing in sharply despite having prepared herself: she was standing within what she could only describe as the child of a cathedral and an officer’s club.

There were ten stories to a structure whose shape was that of a rectangle ending in a rounded wall, but much of it was empty: wooden galleries went around the walls and left a hollow space going up to the distant wooden ceiling in the middle. From the fourth story onward, what would be well above ground level for the island, the rounded walls became great stained-glass windows whose colored light painted everything it touched.

Stairs went from one level to the next, and as they followed Colonel Cao up them Song saw the galleries were filled with dormitories, meeting halls and private offices. There was even a library! It was brisk exercise to climb, but she was too excited to tire.

On the eighth story there was a dining room and kitchen, a handful of officers eating at the tables there, and the two levels afterwards were entirely filled with small, tastefully decorated salons. Yet there was more, as what she’d believed the ceiling was in truth a floor and unlike the others the room at the summit filled that entire level.

And what a sight it was! Nearly half the walls had been removed and replaced with windowpanes, their glass clear and clean. Along one wall was a long counter behind which wine and liquors were stocked, while the opposite wall was entirely covered with a board full of pinned papers. In between the walls was an intricate layout of couches and armchairs set by low tables, looking sinfully comfortable.

Song’s belly clenched with something that was neither quite greed nor admiration: this was everything she wanted about the Academy distilled into a single edifice.

The simple implicit power in having this place refurbished out here on this nowhere island, in maintaining it. The exclusivity, the comfort, the grace. It was the heights she needed to reach if she was to ever make the name Ren into anything but a curse.

“Claim seats as you wish,” Colonel Cao said, waving them off.

The older herself went to the counter, where a sharply dressed man poured her a glass from one of the bottles on the top shelf without even needing to be asked. Only after taking a sip of amber liquor and letting out a sigh of satisfaction did the colonel pull back a seat and sat on it facing them. Song claimed the closest armchair and turned it to face her, sitting ramrod straight, while Ferranda was forced to share a couch with a pair of Lierganen girls and crane her neck instead.

Once Colonel Cao was satisfied with the arrangements, she set down her cup and cleared her throat.

“This,” she said, gesturing at their surroundings, “is the Galleries.”

In the burning pale of the lamplights she seemed younger, as if invigorated by the elegance of their surroundings. Song could sympathize. The prospect of returning to her filthy cottage later already felt like a punishment.

“The dormitories, rooms and library are for you to do with as you please,” Colonel Cao said. “This was once the privilege of Academians alone, but the circumstances of Scholomance’s reopening have seen this courtesy extended to you.”

Murmurs of approbation. Even the little kings and the duchess trailing them seemed impressed by their surroundings, which were no doubt the finest on the island.

“It goes without saying that none of you may bring outsiders and that such an attempt would be harshly punished.”

A shame, Song thought. Angharad might have enjoyed spending the occasional evening here and the Pereduri would have been a great help in navigating the social occasions. Her duel with Musa Shange had, while painting a target on her, also made her the equivalent of a conversation piece. Between the novelty of the story and her Angharad’s good looks, people wanted to talk to her.

“The dining hall is manned at the expense of the Academy, so you will find its fare requires coin – and is far superior to anything else this island has to offer,” she continued. “The same is true of the salons below, if  you require refreshments to be served there.”

She sipped at her drink again.

“I expect, however, that you will be spending the most time on this level,” Colonel Cao said. “The reason is behind you.”

Song turned to better study the great boards filled with pinned papers. Several she recognized as maps with a glance, others as interesting information – there appeared to be a list with the number of students for the year, of cabals and even the number of students by covenant – but the vast majority was something simpler. They were, she saw, bounties.

“The bounty boards are filled with not only the Academy’s chosen tasks but also that of professors, other covenants and even select students,” Colonel Cao said. “Though I will be explaining to you the nature of your training and time in Scholomance, I first invited you to rise and read the existing bounties.”

The watchwoman reached within her coat, pulling out a silvery pocket watch on a matching chain. She popped it open, then glanced at the time.

“You have five minutes to claim one by taking the paper,” Colonel Cao calmly said. “And if your cabal has not accomplished it by the end of the week, you will pack your bags and head to the harbor.”

Chaos erupted.

—

The Fisher liked it here.

The old spirit slithered through her veins like icy water and the feel of him was almost hungry. Angharad kept her eyes straight ahead as they descended into the chasm, trying to force him out, but it was like fighting the tide itself. He would leave when he cared to and not a breath before.

The stairway beneath her feet was carved out of snarling beasts, wolves and lions snapping at her heels as she followed Shalini and Salvador down into the dark. The way below was cut with stripes of light and darkness, the burning paleness of the oil lamps never quite reaching another’s cast as the students followed Marshal de la Tavarin into the depths. He seemed an almost ghostly figure, from a distance, an incongruous splash of color in this stairway filled with the silence of twisting shadows.

At the end of the path lay a grand balcony, an arc of cracked painted tiles filled with seats of stone. At least a hundred of them, Angharad saw, and none entirely alike: some were carved into the likeness of vines and flowers, others of beasts clawing at each other or warring soldiers or raging waves. Years and rain had worn away details, but they were still each a small wonder. Yet all paled compared to the great throne at the center of the arc, twice as tall and wide as any other and carved as a single great skeleton embracing whoever sat on it.

The Marshal walked past it, to the elegant stone railing at the end of the arcing balcony. Angharad could scarce see what was below save for four great lanterns hanging from a ceiling above, all wrought black iron and large as a carriage. They burned brimstone-red, belching out smoke endlessly as they painted the deeps in the likeness of a furnace.

“There was a time,” the Marshal said, “after the world broke and from the corpse of Liergan rose many a king dreaming of empire.”

He had not raised his voice, but Angharad heard him perfectly. No student had dared approach the edge of the balcony, kept back by dim instinct, and not a single whisper broke the silence. Above the earth, bathed in the light of the Orrery, the old man had seemed almost a figure of fun. The descent into the bowels of the earth had since snuffed out that impression.

“Sologuer was one such kingdom,” Marshal de la Tavarin continued, “and for a time the iron-toothed kings of this land ruled over isles and coast as far as their ships could reach.”

The old man laid a hand on the elegant stone railing, looking down at a sight none of them could see.

“They took tribute in gold, as kings do, but their hunger was not so easily sated,” the Marshal said. “Black-bellied ships returned to this island with every turn of the Fool’s Moon, bringing young warriors come to die in a bloody temple.”

She could feel the Fisher smile, savor the old butchery soaked into the stones.

“The Acallar, they called this place.”

He flashed them a grin, revealing glinting silver teeth.

“The kings of Sologuer, you see, believed the slaughter would make them into gods. Beings able to command the orbits of the Grand Orrery and so master the very elements. Even the children of their house sat the thrones, drinking in the slaughter.”

The grin turned mocking.

“The Morningstar, ever sharp of humor, sat in that very seat as they slew each other below for the entertainment of his court.”

She felt Shalini stiffen at her side, as was only sensible when being told that Lucifer had once held court where you stood.

“Come closer,” Marshal de la Tavarin ordered. “Today’s lesson will take place below.”

Hesitantly they approached the edge, the infernal light of the lanterns revealing the grounds where warriors had once fought and died for madmen.

Their balcony, she first saw, was the not the only seats. Facing on the other side, noticeably lower, was a much broader and longer arc of stone benches where a crowd would have been able to gather. That was not, however, where they would be headed.

Perhaps a hundred feet below stood the grounds, a broad circle of stone ringed by large iron cages surrounded by the abyss on all sides. There was hardly a foot of bare floor on it, the arena almost as a broken town: there were low walls and pillars, a few roofed houses, furrows in the ground and even sculpted fountains. There were lower grounds and higher, shallow stairs and subtle drops, while in the shadows lay pitfalls for the unwary.

Dusty bones and weapons long rotted away lay strewn like offerings, one structure standing taller than all the rest: a rough mimicry of the Grand Orrery’s silhouette in rusted iron, a skeleton nailed to it as some sort of grim display.

A broad stone bridge was the only break in the abyss surrounding the grounds, connected to the sole break in the ring of iron cages and leading to a doorway in the wall that was closed by a portcullis. Angharad saw through the steel grid that there burned lantern light past it. Glancing around the grand balcony, she found that tucked away in the shadows was a stairway delving deeper into the earth – there must be tunnels in the walls, some of them leading to the heart of Acallar.

Her gaze withdrew when Shalini gasped as her side, following the Someshwari’s eyes but finding nothing save for the fighting grounds below.

“One of those cages just moved,” Shalini quietly said. “There’s something inside.”

Angharad breathed in sharply. Her friend was not the only one to have noticed, and disquieted murmurs spread across their company. Marshal de la Tavarin seemed indifferent to the turn in the mood.

“Come,” he said. “Let us continue on our way.”

Their professor made for the stairs Angharad had earlier noticed, followed by wary students, but she hung back. She stayed at the railing, silently counting cages as the other two stared at her in confusion.

“Around fifty, I think,” she said. “Fewer than there are students.”

“So either not everyone’s fighting in that pit or we will be forming squads,” Shalini said, catching on.

Salvador nodded in agreement.

“Squad,” he predicted. “Like when hunting lemures.”

“I wonder how large they will be?” Angharad murmured.

If there were three then the arrangement was good as made, but more than that would require some thought. Less as well, in a different away.

“I’m more curious about how they got the beasts down there in the first place,” Shalini noted. “Either way, the garrison must be involved – I doubt His Grace did it all by himself.”

That last guess from Shalini was proved true when the three of them followed the current down the stairs, passing through a well-lit guardhouse where a handful of watchmen were seated and playing cards. The soldiers spared them only glances, otherwise ignoring them as they passed. There was another pair by the portcullis, which was now raised by the work of a wheel by its side. It is meant to keep people in, Angharad thought, and not out.

The bridge over the abyss was wide but utterly without railing and the faint breeze down here had her body prickling with unease.

They found the Marshal perched atop a low brick wall by a great crack splitting it, the great feather on his hat fluttering in the breeze. The old man waited for all the students to gather below him, stroking his impressive mustache as he watched them. He cleared his throat when all were arrived, flicking his great sleeves in an eye-drawing gesture.

“The first of the Skiritai,” he said, “were not god-killers.”

That snuffed out every other whisper of conversation, many of which had bloomed. Angharad herself knew precious little of the history of the guild she was to join, its past as shrouded as the rest of the Watch’s.

“They were mercenaries, driven to the blade-trade by their home island turning barren beneath their feet,” Marshal de la Tavarin told them. “Desperate for coin to feed their families worth, they took the worst of the contracts: the most brutal, the most dangerous, the most hopeless.”

A harsh fate, Angharad thought, but such work was respectable in its own way.

“Years turned into decades,” the Marshal said, “and enough lived that the Skiritai became known as the finest warriors on the Trebian Sea – sought-after by a hundred warring kings.”

The old man coughed into his fist, then dabbed at his lips with a mustard-yellow handkerchief he produced from his sleeve.

“To the Skiritai a child was not grown until they had cut down a man, so their soldier-youths they called by the same name as the blade they were to wield: kopis.”

It sounded like a word from a hollow cant, Angharad thought, but she was no scholar in such regards. Perhaps she ought to ask Song.

“Long after the island these first of the Skiritai were born to faded from memory,” Marshal de la Tavarin continued, “our guild continued the practice in honor of these humble beginnings. An initiate of the Skiritai is known as a skopis, a sword for the Watch to wield.”

The Marshal flashed them that grin again, a handful of silver teeth glinting in the light.

“You are not even that, of course. To be an initiate of the Skiritai Guild is something earned and you have earned less than dust.”

Unhappy mutters. Even Angharad found herself frowning. He spoke no lie, but his truth was spoken with contempt. They were nor arrant children claiming something to which they had no tie, they had been chosen by the very guild he spoke for. Laying his cane on his knees, the old man clapped his hands.

“So be glad, children, for today you are given the opportunity to begin redeeming that miscarriage,” the Marshal said.

He chuckled.

“In blood and ichor, as is our way.”

The old man leaped down from his perch, landing with surprising lightness on his feet. He pointed his cane forward, the crowd moving out of the way, and their gazes landed on a cage. Which shook, the sound of claws on metal echoing loudly into the silence.

“There are sixty cages,” the Marshal said. “Each contains something worth killing.”

“Like what?”

The question came from the back of the crowd, not a face Angharad could see. The professor did not seem offended by the interruption.

“Now that would be telling,” the old man laughed. “Lemures one and all, I will say, but hardly any two are the same – behind that door could be a pair of lupines or a raging griffin, depending on your luck.”

He tucked his arm behind his back, sleeve trailing.

“I tell you true, children, I am a merciful man,” Marshal de la Tavarin solemnly said. “I have spared more men death by my hand than you have seen sparrows fly.”

Angharad’s lips thinned. Unless the professor had once commanded over a great surrender, that was most unlikely. Which meant a man she was meant to offer respect to might very well be a liar.

“True to my nature, I offer you the chance to make bands of four or less before choosing which cage you are to open. Are you not grateful?”

The noblewoman’s lips thinned even further. Lupines were easy enough to handle Angharad believed she could kill a pair by herself, but a griffin? There were no such beasts in Malan but their reputation was fearsome far beyond their Trebian hunting grounds. She was not sure that even a squad of four could kill such a creature – not without deaths or grave wounds, anyway. Unless to name a griffin as an example had been an exaggeration, another lie.

Disgraceful either way.

“Why,” the Marshal mused, “some of you seem quite displeased. Speak up, if you’ve doubts.”

Lord Musa swiftly stepped to the fore, face pleasant but eyes contemptuous.

“Sir,” he began-

“Your Grace,” the old man mildly said, “or Marshal.”

“Marshal,” the Malani swordmaster corrected. “Given our lack of preparations and these unfavorable grounds, the likes of a griffin would be difficult for some among us to slay.”

The Marshal snorted.

“So you’re saying my little surprise is ill thought out,” he said.

“I would not say such a thing,” Lord Musa replied.

Which was nothing but polite agreement in the Malani way. The old man sighed, shaking his head.

“There are some who would agree with you, boy,” the Marshal said. “Who have, in the past.”

He clicked his tongue.

“Few of them lasted out a year as Skiritai.”

Musa Shange’s face tightened at the implied insult.

“Your mindset is one of defeat,” the Marshal lectured, leaning on his cane. “You look for a path, tracing with your fingers something you hope might lead to the death of your opponent. That is a mistake.”

He scoffed.

“You are a Militant,” he said. “The path begins with the death of your opponent, traced back to where you stand. Uncertainty is surrender.”

The old man stepped forward.

“But perhaps proof is required,” he said. “So proof I will grant. Pick one, boy.”

“Pardon?” Lord Musa frowned.

“Pick a cage,” the Marshal said, “and I will kill whatever is inside with nothing more than what I bear. I am an old man, and barely armed. If I can succeed, what would be objections from you save whining?”

The Malani laughed incredulously, then gazed back at the crowd. Angharad shifted, feeling as uncertain as he did. What if the old man died? Only the Marshal’s face remained utterly serious. After a moment Musa Shange cleared his throat, then pointed at a cage some ways away – by a flat stretch of ground fenced in by furrows in the ground. The cage did not shake, whatever awaited inside disinclined to rattle its prison.

“Mhm,” the Marshal said. “I don’t remember what’s in that. I do enjoy a surprise.”

The old man sent them back across the bridge and to the guardhouse, telling them to take from there a right – there were hidden stairs there, which they followed up to the large balcony with the benches. It was much closer to the grounds below than the heights above had been, enough that Angharad thought she might be able to leap down there without breaking her legs.

It would hurt a great deal, she figured, but it could be done.

As the quiet students spread out across the benches, staying in the same small circles they had from the start but now eyeing each other with the prospect of a fight looming ahead, Angharad saw the watchmen on the other side of the portcullis lowered it. Though Shalini and Salvador stayed seated, the noblewoman instead went to lean against the railing as she watched the Marshal moving below. The old man began undoing the latches on the large iron cage one after another, then wrenched the door open and stepped back.

Nothing came out, at first.

Then a ten-fingered hand larger than a head reached out, the monster within peeking out a large red-maned head and began dragging itself out. Whatever the lemure was it was large, Angharad thought.

“Onjancanu,” Salvador hoarsely whispered behind her. “Old Tyrant.”

She could hear the wariness in the voice of a man she doubted was easily cowed.

The creature rose, knees creaking like old hinges as its long red beard swept against the ground, and it unfolded to its full height. Twenty feet, broad-shouldered and built like a tower as the red string of its beard mixed with the long red mane of its back to cover its front. The limbs were naked and hairy, ten fingers and toes ending in nails of sharp bone. Its skin was thick and sickly-yellow, its nose overlarge and sniffing at the air as its single wet and lidless eye flicked about this way and that. The sclera was burnt orange, the pupil black and slowly the onjancanu opened a great maw filled with rows of teeth.

It began to laugh, the sound of it guttural and shivering all the way down to her toes.

The Marshal stood alone before it, both hands resting atop his lionhead cane as he looked up at the monster’s monstrous face. He had yet to reach for a weapon.

“Disappointing,” the old man said, words carrying up to them on the wind. “They starved you too much, hardly any mind left in you.”

Without even turning his way, the monster snatched a loose stone the size of a table and tossed it at him so casually it took Angharad a heartbeat to realize what had just happened – only instead of Marshal de la Tavarin’s splattered remains, what she saw was the old man’s coat sleeve fluttering where the deadly weight had narrowly brushed past it. He had barely moved half a foot, the mirror-dancer realized, and not even quickly. Leaning on his cane, the Marshal began closing the distance with slow steps.

Now he had the monster’s attention.

The onjancanu screamed and stomped forward, those tree-trunk legs shaking the ground as it caught up to old man in the blink of an eye and reached to snatch him up with its mouth already open for the gobble – only with a casual, almost gentle press of his cane on the knuckles the Marshal brushed aside the clawed hand enough it passed half an inch wide of him. In the heartbeat before the monster turned aside to scoop him up with the other hand, the old man viciously struck with the butt if his cane on the monster’s foot.

It let out a scream of pain, picking up its own foot as it hopped back, and tried to blindly smack away at the offending fly with the side of its hand. The Marshal stepped past the swing into the monster’s guard, its wrist ruffling the feather on the old man’s hat even as he struck at the knee it was hopping on. Shouting furiously, the beast opened its arms wide and let itself collapse on the Marshal – who kept moving forward even as it dropped forward.

He emerged between its legs, the gust of wind from the onjancanu hitting the ground sending his hat flying. He snatched it out of the hair, casually pressing it back down on his head even as the great ogre threw a tantrum and began wailing at the floor with its hand and feet. A flailing foot almost caught him in the ribs, a blow sure to turn his ribs to powder, but with unhurried precision the old man pressed down on his cane to leap above the blind sweep like a lamb over a fence.

The onjancanu must have felt him, however, for it turned from its belly to its side with a roar to face the irritating bug and, hand rising high – the Marshal nonchalantly reached inside his coat and withdrew an ornate pistol, pulling the trigger. Snap, powder billowed out and wet viscera burst where the monster’s sole eye had been as the roar turned into a hoarse scream. The palm came down, but it caught only dust as the Marshal leaned back the spent pistol on his shoulder and closed on the creature cradling its eye with its other hand.

Angharad felt her stomach clench with something like fear. She had known from the start that despite his appearance and seeming foolishness, the old man must be deadly – how else could he have lived old as one of the Militants, that band ever first into the breach? Yet she had expected a contract or some terrifying weapon, not… this.

At no point in the fight had the Marshal even moved faster than at a walk.

She had stared at him every moment, blinking as little as she could, and he did not begin moving before the creature did – this was not foresight, like her own contract. He had not brushed aside the blows of the lemure with strength leant by a spirit or wounded it with some trick. Any half-trained fighter would be able to strike as strongly as he had with the slightly pointed bottom of his cane. This was, Angharad realized with something like awe, pure skill.

The Marshal, now by the blinded onjancanu’s face, folded past the furious slap of a great hand on the ground and as his coat fluttered he twirled his cane in that same gesture she had thought pointless vanity – and then thrust it tip first into the mutilated gelatinous orb. In the heartbeat that followed Angharad saw the old man’s death writ. He had not been strong enough to push it all the way and kill the beast, the large ogre’s arms were now coming to enfold him and –

Spinning the empty pistol in his hand so the cooled barrel rested against his palm, the Marshal hammered the cane in with the butt of the pistol.

The screaming cut out, the onjancanu’s brains pierced through, and after a mighty twitch the arms about to crush the old man dropped and began flopping uselessly on the ground. Putting away his pistol, the Marshal placed his boot against the monster’s great head and pulled out his cane. It took him three heaves and there was a splatter of blood on his coat, but black on black did not show.

Uncertainty was surrender, he had told them, and suddenly Angharad grasped a sliver of what he’d meant. The Marshal had never once hesitated in that fight, let uncertainty slow his stride or confuse his design. It was as if the entire fight had been a single, continuous movement from beginning to end. And that was not simple skill, Angharad knew. It took more than that. It took experience.

How many onjancanu had the Marshal killed, to toy with this one so casually?

The beast had stopped twitching by the time he turned to face them, flashing a silver grin. The hellish red light cast his shadow behind him, and in that silhouette Angharad thought she glimpsed a mound of corpses so tall it would fill this entire cavern. Men and beasts, gods and devils – everything under firmament. To be an old Skiritai, she thought, was to carry a graveyard in your trail. And that? That was something she could learn.

Something she wanted to learn.

“See?” the Marshal said. “Even an old man can do it.”

And the greater of the two monsters walked away from the other’s corpse, calling for them to make their squads and come down in order as his cane left a trail of black blood on the ground.

# Chapter 16

The legwork took around an hour and a half.

Some of it was hitting pavement and casing the place without looking suspicious, but the real sweat came when Tristan had to consider how it would all go wrong. Half the time spent rustling up a scheme, Abuela had taught him, should be considering how to get out when it turned on you. Unfortunately, he was no longer fooling around with halfwit coterie thugs: unlike the rare Guardia patrols out in the Murk the local garrison wasn’t likely to keep walking if they stumbled onto a crime looking like too much trouble to handle.

Not that a plan needed enemy action to go sour: ambition was as much your enemy as the other side. The trick, he had come to believe, was to keep it as simple as you could. Keep a straight line of intent, then account for everything you knew about and leave a little loose rope for what you didn’t. Too many moving parts made for a wreck, not a clock, and fortune was just as fickle as Fortuna. It was better to home in on a single weakness and slide that knife in as deep as you could, then exploit the advantage for all it was worth.

In this case, the weakness was that Tristan knew where Captain Wen Duan lived.

It had been necessary for the man to tell Song so she might pass on the Thirteenth’s choices of electives, and caution had seen the thief learn it himself. Tristan had since made sure it was a house and not some office, then taken the lay of the land. The single-story house was just past Templeward Street, near its end, and in a street that was mostly empty buildings. Nobody lived on either side of Wen. The figured that their patron had come late to Tolomontera to get one of the nice houses in what he’d heard garrison men called the ‘Triangle’: the nice part of Port Allazei delineated by Regnant, Templeward and Hostel.

First complication? Wen appeared to live with Sergeant Mandisa. Not only did the tall sergeant reek of danger, she was hard to get a grip on. Tristan knew some of what made Wen Duan angry and happy, could pull those strings if he put in the work, but Sergeant Mandisa? He’d not been able to get a read on her, on what made her step or hold. He could make guesswork, but guesswork made for a mighty fragile lifeline. Better to make her irrelevant to how it all fell out if he could.

Then cut the time by half and be twice as careful. Just in case.

After that came supplies. Buying would have left a trail, in the seller’s memory if not in their ledgers, so Tristan stole instead. It was as simple as waiting for another watchman to be headed into the right shop on Regnant Street, then cut ahead to buy an apple from the greenmonger and snatch a jar on the way out. Casually, almost slowly. The kind of movement that would not make the monger look away from their other client until he was long gone.

He picked the alley, the house and the place to stash the goods. Penned the note on the paper, blew it dry. Someone looking for him would try the back, he figured, because they would expect him to be sneaky about it. It was not a sure thing, never was, but he liked his odds. They’d want him, want what his head on a pike meant. Yeah, they’d be headed out back.

After that, most of what was left was bribes.

To open he found an urchin. Port Allazei was remarkably short on those for a port town, but there were always a few if you knew where to look. A slip of a girl, Lierganen and fair-haired, was skulking around the part of Templeward where there were teahouses – and so occasionally freshly baked goods insufficiently watched. The moment he approached she scowled.

“I’m not going to school,” she firmly told him. “I don’t care what Mom says, they’re teaching us triangle stuff.”

Her voice strongly conveyed this was a fate worse than death.

“I agree with her,” Fortuna mused, leaning against his shoulder. “They feel more arrogant than squares and they don’t even have as many sides.”

Tristan forced himself not to engage, instead looking down at the kid.

“What’s your name?”

“What’s it to you?” she challenged.

“I’ll call you nina,” he threatened.

A pause.

“Arabella,” the girl grudgingly conceded.

“Arabella,” he said. “I’ll give you a copper if you wait for me at the bottom of Templeward for…”

He fished out his watch, estimated the back and forth.

“Twenty minutes,” he said. “Then I’ll be back and I’ll give you another copper for either passing someone a paper or forgetting all about this.”

Arabella considered him, low cunning alight in her brown eyes.

“I’ll do it for your watch,” she said.

“Two coppers now,” Tristan said, “a third if you have to pass the paper.”

“Deal,” she hastily said.

The thief rubbed the bridge of his nose. No, that just wouldn’t do.

“That’s not how you do it,” Tristain said, finding his voice had taken the Sacromonte cant. “You tried too high then settled right away. What you do is go just a little higher – five or six coppers instead of two – and let yourself be bargained down to four. If you only shuttle between copper and gold, you’ll never make silver.”

Arabella squinted at him.

“Six coppers,” she tried.

“I like her spirit,” Fortuna noted. “You should pay her.”

He snorted, at both attempts.

“I’ve already paid you with a valuable lesson,” Tristan said. “Our terms stand.”

“For another copper I’ll throw horse shit at someone’s door,” Arabella earnestly offered.

He scratched his chin.

“I might trade for that later,” the thief admitted. “But not today. Deal?”

“Deal.”

They spat on their palms and the little girl solemnly shook his hand. Their parting of ways was pleasantly brisk, leaving him to arrange a bribe that would not be half as well deserved as strode towards the docks. It was not far, and he knew the way. The detainment house was not a prison, despite Maryam’s insistence to the contrary. Tristan had seen prisons, and the chairs weren’t anywhere as nice.

There also tended to be significantly more torture.

Getting in was as simple as knocking and presenting his brigade plaque. Fortunately, it was early enough in the day that the man he was looking for was still there. Sergeant Itzcuin Hotl had spent the latter half of his detainment with him when he was sent here after his little jaunt through the Witching House and seemed happy to see him again – as he should, given how much Tristan had made sure to lose at cards. The thief was quickly ushered into an empty room.

Of course, the thief suspected those card games were not the only reason for the enthusiasm. It might even be said he had bet on it.

“I need a favor,” Tristan said with a winning smile.

Sergeant Hotl raised an eyebrow, so the thief replied in a straightforward manner by reaching into his coat and putting down twelve copper radizes on the table, spreading them smoothly in a line. The eyebrow rose even higher.

“You have my attention,” the sergeant said.

“In an unfortunate misunderstanding, my visit here will be misconstrued as my being under arrest and a message sent to Captain Wen that he should come fetch me,” Tristan said.

The Izcalli sergeant chewed on that for a moment.

“Full silver,” he finally replied. “If he complains, it could leave a mark on my record.”

The thief was likely being sold a line, but he was in no position to argue. And, in truth, did not even have much time to bargain. The coppers were swept back into his hand and tucked away in a pouch, replaced by a single silver arbol that the sergeant immediately snatched.

“Pleasure doing business with you, Abrascal,” Sergeant Hotl grinned. “I’ll send a runner as soon as you’re out.”

Tristan bowed his thanks and took his leave. Instead of rushing back, however, he ducked into an alley across the street and kept to the shadows. Eyes on the only door in or out of the detainment house, he waited. A blackcloak walked out, quick on his feet.

He did not head in the direction of Captain Wen’s house. The second blackcloak, who left a minute after, did.

“Why are you smiling?” Fortuna asked, leaning in.

“Because I had him pegged right,” Tristan said. “And Arabella is going to be making that last copper after all.”

—

Down the circling stairs they went, holding a candle in their hand.

Each of the Abbey cells had a number painted on the door, matching the cabal of the student it was to belong to. Maryam forced herself, even through her rising fear, to keep an eye on those ahead of her. Most of the first twelve brigades of Scholomance had a signifier among them. She kept an eye on the numbers she remembered from elsewhere: the Third had one, a Someshwari boy looking half-asleep, and that scowling girl from Tupoc’s cabal slammed the door of her own cell. The Ninth, those fuckers, also had one – though the hood kept Maryam from learning anything about them save that they were tall.

Soon Maryam was pulling open her own door, setting down the chamberstick in a small alcove carved into the wall before closing it behind her.

Cell, she thought, was a good word for a room like this. The door might lock only from the inside but the barren walls seemed like a prisoner’s punishment. Bare stone all around, save for a mat of woven straw painted in fading green that presumably she was meant to sit on. There was nothing around her, and once her gaze stopped shying away Maryam beheld the Nothing that was before her. There was no fourth wall to the cell, only an absence revealing the pit of depthless dark.

Carefully she sent out her nav, the soul-effigy feeling out the cell, and she found that the aether here was almost forcefully placid. There were no currents at all, nothing swimming in the waters even though she was mere feet away from a hole in the world. There was nothing natural about this – someone, something was keeping the aether calm. She withdrew her nav, unwilling to risk sending it out too long in such a place.

The Izvorica sat on the mat, which was only mildly uncomfortable, and crossed her legs. How long before the professor came? Not long enough, she thought. He would start from the first cell and work his way down, so there were all too few before the knock came at her door.

Maryam should have spent the time feeling out the boons of the Abbey, how they might aid in her learning, but instead she bit her lip and sat there dreading the coming knock. It was almost a relief when it finally came, a gentle rap of the knuckles on the wrought iron door. She mumbled for the professor to enter, and after the tall scarecrow of a man shut the door she cleared her throat.

“I see no need to use the Kuru Maze,” Maryam said. “I have sufficient understanding of where I stand regarding the Measures.”

Professor Baltasar cocked an eyebrow at her.

“Unfortunately,” he said, “for you it isn’t a choice.”

She grit her teeth. She had been ready to be questioned, but not outright refused.

“You have attracted Captain Yue’s interest,” the older man said. “This is but the first of a several measurements she will want you to undertake.”

Maryam’s jaw clenched.

“I did not enroll in Scholomance to become a test subject,” she bit out. “Who is Captain Yue, that I must indulge her curiosity?”

“She cannot force you, should you refuse,” Professor Baltasar acknowledged. “But as the senior Akelarre on the island, she canmake your life very unpleasant should she be so inclined.”

He paused.

“Unless you have a pressing reason not to, Maryam, I would use the Maze and take this one on the nose. Making a few early concessions will make her look tyrannical should she punish you when you elect to refuse her later on – she will want to avoid the perception.”

Maryam almost cursed. Should she refuse anyway? No, that was pride talking. The fear of shame. Surely Professor Baltazar would not simply throw her out of the class when he saw her results. If anything, she grudgingly admitted to herself, she could use the help.

“Fine,” she forced out, anger still tight in her throat.

Professor Baltasar passed her the stone disk, which she inspected closely as he began to explain how it was to be used. The maze was little more than furrows in stone, but there was something about the pattern… it felt solid in her thoughts, even more so than the stone it was carved on.

“Put your thumbs on the side of the disk,” the professor instructed. “You must then grasp as much as the Gloam as you feel you can and pour it into the stone – it will spread out from the notch in the center, then begin spreading in all directions.

Maryam breathed out, began to sharpen her mind as she placed her hands as indicated.

“Instead of allowing it to spread you must contain the center then command a tendril to follow along the maze, always turning left. The further you get in the maze, the more difficult commanding the Gloam will become.”

In and out, letting distractions fall away.

“The measurable results of the Kuru Maze are limited to a Grasp of ten and a Command of fifteen,” Professor Baltasar continued. “It cannot easily withstand greater strength, making it of only marginal value for older signifiers.”

Maryam narrowed in her being, tempered it, then felt for the Gloam. The dark she carried in her.

“Begin.”

It was like breathing in with endless lungs.

Maryam drew on the Gloam, let it pass through her, only she need not wield her nav as a hand and trace a Sign to be filled. Instead she poured the cold nothingness into the stone disk, widening the channels within her until the torrent filled her very being – and almost scraped at the sides, pinching and aching. I am the riverbed, she recited. I dwell through passage, act through stillness. Roiling Gloam bubbled out of the notch at the heart of the maze, settled instead of volatile.

And it poured, poured, poured.

Maryam took hold of her nav, tried to guide it to the left, but it was like taking a bucket out of the tide and calling it a river. Like a sea of ink the Gloam spread heedlessly through every turn of the Kuru Maze, breaking through the symmetry meant to slow it. Only as it approached the edge did it slow, stopping but a finger’s breadth away from the end of the stone. She could not move it further.

“Release your grasp,” Professor Baltasar said, voice unreadable.

She did, inch by inch, and the Gloam receded. Maryam handed the professor the disc, unable to look him in the eye.

“Nine Grasp, one Command,” he said after a moment. “Perhaps two. It is difficult to assess.”

Professor Baltasar started speaking, then paused. A moment passed, then he cleared his throat.

“This is absurd,” he finally said. “That gap is too large, you should be long dead.”

“I am aware,” Maryam stiffly said.

Too large a gap between the Two Measures nearly always resulted in the signifier’s death. For her own affliction – strong Grasp and weak Command – the reason why was easy enough to understand. A Gloam-witch delving too deep into powers beyond her control was the cornerstone of many stories for a reason. In principle, however, a strong Command and weak Grasp should not be lethal. How could a surfeit of control be a danger to you?

In practice, however, the result was spurts of uncontrolled obscuration as the signifier tried to draw on power that did not exist. Captain Totec had told her that, according to the Akelarre Guild’s records, borderline cases leaning the way of Command died more than those leaning the way of Grasp because they tended to believe themselves in control even when they were not. That was only for borderline cases, however, the equivalent of perhaps a seven to a three.

Maryam’s nine to one was an effective death sentence.

Professor Baltasar continued staring at her, as if further and further scowling would brand answers onto her forehead for him to read. He sighed after a moment, stroking his beard.

“You struggle with everything but Autarchic Signs,” he said.

The statement had a lilt to it, the unspoken question of is-this-a-lie, but Maryam nodded. It was the truth, and the look of bafflement on his face was entirely warranted. Of all Signs, the Autarchic were the most fragile. They required great precision and a delicate touch.

“You should not be able to even breathe in one’s direction without shattering it,” Professor Baltasar said. “Even a simple memory Sign at your level of Command should cook the inside of your head like a boiled egg.”

It was a vivid enough image she winced.

“My teacher,” she said, “believes it derives from the way I obscured my brain before puberty.”

“That’s another death sentence,” Professor Baltasar noted. “Usually, anyway. I understand you undertook your first obscuration before you were taken in by the Guild?”

Maryam nodded. He looked sympathetic.

“Traditional practices can sometimes cripple one’s potential as a signifier,” he said. “There are reasons for our ways.”

My mother could have snapped Captain Totec like a twig, Maryam thought, and she went through the same ritual I did. No, if there was a flaw then it was in her.

“Are you going to send me away?” she asked, looking down at the floor.

A long silence, then a sigh.

“I would,” Professor Baltasar frankly said, “but I do not have that authority.”

She looked up at the thin man, daring to hope for help, but the earlier sympathy was gone.

“I am here, Maryam, to help guide what is meant to be the elite of Akelarre youth,” Baltasar said. “Barring great changes in circumstances, you are unlikely to ever be one of them.”

She swallowed. No lie had been spoken that she might grapple with. It burned twice as much for it.

“You’re not going to help me,” she said.

“You will have of me what is owed as your teacher,” Professor Baltasar said, “but nothing more. I only have so many hours to spend, and to be blunt they are better spent elsewhere.”

Maryam fought the flinch, but it ripped through. The professor tucked away the Kuru Maze into his robes.

“So what am I to do?” she quietly asked. “What am I supposed to do?”

Hand on the handle, the professor hesitated for a moment. He turned to meet her eyes.

“I gave you a piece of advice, on the day we met, about not interesting Captain Yue too much,” Professor Baltasar said.

He grimaced.

“It might be best for you to ignore it, after all.”

He closed the door behind him, the sound of iron on stone like a tolling bell. Maryam sat there, numb and alone in the waning candlelight. And for a long time she stayed there, as light dimmed and flickered and her thoughts circled like vultures. Mother had once told her that decisions were made hard only by the muck of the mind, all the attachments of the world tainting the pure truth within you. They could be made simple again by flipping a coin and asking yourself this: what outcome can you not live with? The other side, however bitter, was always the path to undertake.

So within her mind Maryam flipped the coin, watched it spin, and asked herself the question.

It was not a pleasant path she saw laid ahead of her. It would be… difficult in more sense than one. Maryam was not unaware she had a temper. But she still rose to her feet and brushed off her gifted cloak. What few comforts she had stolen back from the world she would not surrender, so the answer was clear.

Maryam would seek out Captain Yue and strike a bargain.

—

Half the class were on their feet in the heartbeat that followed, rushing towards the boards like the bounties were on fire.

Song, instead, calmly rose and faced as much as the wall as she could. She blinked, once, and breathed out. The sheer number of details was… Hand on the chisel, the Tianxi reminded herself. All the bounties were in Antigua and they were divided into five smaller boards. The smallest and emptiest, which she discarded immediately, was bounties set by students. One board was dedicated to covenant bounties, another to those set by the professors, and the largest by far was ‘general’ bounties. The last bounty board, which seemed to have the same five sheets repeated by the dozen, displayed ‘trials’.

“Song?” Ferranda asked, standing by her.

A reliable ally, she decided, should be granted the occasional favor.

“Second board from the left, near the bottom,” Song told her. “There are Skiritai bounties with a decent payout that requires only three lemure corpses.”

And with Shalini in her cabal, Ferranda Villazur would find attracting lemures into trapped grounds trivially easy.

The Tianxi’s silver gaze never moved from the boards, having marked an interesting detail: the covenant bounties, trials and around half the general bounties appeared to have a promised reward in ‘score’ as well as coin. Never a number larger than six – that highest score belonging the ‘Trial of Night’ – but she was finding it difficult to put together a common thread tying together those rewards. She would have used the gaze-trick again but now there were so many students in the way there was hardly a point.

Song, instead, went to the rightmost board. The trials were only described in the broadest strokes, but given how many times the sheets had been hung cabals would likely be forced to take them at some point in the year. Why not get ahead of the curve? If the Thirteenth did well, it would be information worth trading.

The Tianxi set aside all consideration of the bottom three, which rewarded most richly but also appeared dangerous enough the Thirteenth was not ready for them. The first two, however, had potential. The Trial of Mirrors was described as a ‘test of intuition and trust’ while the Trial of Contest was a ‘test in overcoming personal weakness’. To fill the latter bounty the entire cabal must undertake the trial, and the reward was two silver a head and a score of four.

“Half the time left,” Colonel Cao informed them from the bar.

Tempted as she was to pick the Trial of Mirrors, as it smacked of illusions, Song suspected that relying too much on her eyes to carry the Thirteenth through a trial would be a mistake. She carefully pulled out the nail keeping a sheet of the Trial of Contest in place and put it back afterwards, sparing a look of disdain for the girl next to her who simply ripped her bounty off.

With her bounty claimed, Song decided had some time to spare and pushed through the squabbling crow to head to the part of the wall that wasn’tboards.

It was all maps and lists, one of the latter having earlier attracted her eye: a detailed disposition of the number of Scholomance students, overall and by covenant. There were, Song read, four hundred and three students. Some sort of deal must have been struck between the Academy and the Akelarre Guild, which had sixty recommended each, while the Skiritai took the crown of all cabals at an impressive seventy-five. The three societies of the College each had fifty-five students, doubtlessly arrange symmetry, and the Krypteia-

Smudged ink and ‘don’t worry about it’ written in insultingly sloppy Cathayan characters. It was an entirely pointless gesture, Song mused, considering that simple subtraction yielded that the Mask students numbered forty-three.

“Would you be surprised to hear one of the Academy bounties is about finding out who keeps doing that?”

Song turned towards the source of the voice, finding it a somewhat familiar face: the Malani beauty that had been speaking with Sebastian Camaron at the Old Playhouse. Now that Song could hear the voice, she noted her Antigua was accented in a different way than Angharad’s was. Not a Pereduri, then.

“It seems more a statement of power on the part of the Masks than genuine sabotage,” Song replied.

“As if the Krypteia was not already feared enough,” the other woman chuckled, then shook her head. “But I forget myself – Captain Imani Langa, Eleventh Brigade.”

Captain Imani’s smile as she offered her hand to shake was perfectly disarming, Song thought. And so practiced it made her own teeth hurt.

“Captain Song Ren, Thirteenth Brigade,” she replied as she shook it.

“I must confess I was already aware of that,” Captain Imani said. “I became curious after meeting one of your cabalists.”

After failing to poach Angharad, she meant.

“And is your curiosity now sated?” Song idly asked.

“Not at all,” Captain Imani replied. “You seem an interesting woman, Miss Ren. It would please me for us to have dinner sometime – perhaps try this dining hall beneath our feet? My treat.”

It certainly wasn’t going to be Song’s: she was painfully aware of the state of her brigade’s finances. Before she could even consider an answer, the snap of a watch closing cut through the chatter and Colonel Cao called for them to return to their seats. Imani Langa smiled and inclined her head, which Song returned.

That courtesy did not extent to refraining from looking at the other captain’s contract while she walked away.

The Tianxi did not have long, so she scanned for the sentences that stood out most. It was, she found by the time she wrenched her gaze away and returned to her seat, a rather subtle contract. Imani Langa’s boon was to know when she was being beheld or listened to, and from what direction. It seemed a contract better fit for a spy or a diplomat than an officer, she thought, but then spies and diplomats would need commanders as well. Mere moments after Song sat in her previous seat – she was among the last to – the colonel swept the room with her gaze.

“Well, it appears no one here is such a colossal failure they were unable to choose a bounty in the given time,” she said. “Splendid.”

A pause, then a flick of the thumb snapped open her watch again.

“When in the service is the Watch it is uncommon for the assignment you receive to be as simple as it looks. Congratulations, you now have five minutes to trade bounties with someone else.”

Chaos erupted again, but Song simply cocked her head to the side. Ferranda, seated on the nearby couch, leaned in and cleared her throat as if to ask permission. The Tianxi inclined her bounty the infanzona’s way, giving her a look at the contents, and the infanzona did the same. Ferranda had taken her suggestion and claimed a Skiritai bounty – and grimaced at the sight of Song’s own claim. She did not seem enthused at the notion of taking a trial.

“Trade me anyway,” Song said.

The infanzona’s brow rose.

“Why?”

“The colonel never said we could not trade them back,” Song replied.

There a was a noise of surprise from the woman sitting next to Ferranda , who must have been eavesdropping on their conversation. The captain of the Thirty-First hummed, then nodded decisively. They traded bounties, waited a heartbeat then traded them back.

The other two girls on the couch where now whispering excitedly and shooting Song impressed looks – she straightened her back in pride. One was leaning over to another seat and talking in low voices, word already spreading. Song was distracted enough she almost missed the colonel’s approach. Almost. Song folded her hands onto her laps, meeting the older woman’s gaze, and got a snort.

“It took cleverness to catch that,” Colonel Cao said.

It was an effort not to smile.

“But a wise girl would have kept it quiet.”

Song stiffened. Suddenly the impressed whispers from the couch seemed like a condemnation, even as they spread to neighbors. Oh, she realized. It had been another test, and she had given away the answer.

“I expect at least half a dozen of you figured that  out,” the colonel mildly said. “Only one was fool enough to spread it around, however.”

The older Tianxi looked around the room, finding Song’s blunder spreading like a spill of ink on white paper, and sighed.

“The broth is spoiled,” she said, shaking her head, then raised her voice. “Alonso, bring up the board!”

The man in livery behind the counter took a few steps to the left, then hiked up a large slate. It was propped up against the wall behind the counter, high enough anyone could see it.

“Trade on your own time,” Colonel Cao told the students. “We move on.”

Song almost flinched. Hand on the chisel. The colonel withdrew to the counter, but only to sit: the drink was long empty.

“The first two afternoons of the week will be spent on a class here in the Galleries, where I will attempt to hammer into your heads the basic knowledge necessary for operating out in Vesper in our name – logistics, administration and organization. Unlike what some of you might expect, I have no intention of delving into the backbiting ways so unfortunately prevalent within our order.”

Her eyes narrowed.

“I came here to teach field officers, not second-rate schemers.”

Colonel Cao leaned back to wiggle her glass at the servant – Alonso, it seemed – and the man dutifully filled it up from the same bottle.

“Unless one of you proves to be remarkably terrible in all regards, those classes cannot affect your placement at Scholomance,” she continued. “They are not, by my reckoning, the crux of what a Stripe should study.”

The colonel took a sip from her drink.

“You’ve seen the bounties and the rewards on them,” she said. “There are two currencies on offer: coin and score.”

Murmurs did not spread – she did not have the kind of presence that invited such a thing – but quite a few ears pricked. It felt like the whole crowd was leaning in.

“The former needs no explanation, but the latter is what will determine if you stay on for a second year,” Colonel Cao said.

The silence that followed was particularly still.

“Each Academy recommendation will be evaluated on a scale that goes up to one hundred,” the colonel said. “Every time your cabal completes a bounty with a score reward, your score on that scale rises accordingly. Each your cabal fails to accomplish such a bounty, your total will fall by the same.”

She raised a finger.

“And somewhere on that scale of one hundred is the line in the sand you must cross to be allowed to continue at Scholomance for a second year,” Colonel Cao said. “Is it fifty? Is it seventy? Only I know. The only assurance you have is that the line is the same for everyone.”

She shrugged.

“I will also grant and dock points to individuals as I see fit, depending on whether you can impress or appall me. Speaking of.”

The colonel set down her glass and cleared her throat.

“We have our first scorer of the year, Alonso,” Colonel Cao said.

Song’s stomach dropped.

“Song Ren, negative one,” the colonel instructed. “For having failed to properly make use of an opportunity – she neither fully outed her trick to the crowd nor hid it for her advantage, finding the worst of both worlds.”

She did not let herself sink into the armchair or even stare down at the floor. It would be a weakness, and weakness would not be forgiven at Scholomance. But Song could not quite force down the flush of humiliation, even as she felt unkind smirks bloom around her. Alonso wrote her name in chalk and added that shameful number past it.

“Well, the games have officially begun,” Colonel Cao said. “So let ask you what will be perhaps the most important question of your career.”

Song’s finger clenched. Perhaps if she answered correctly…

“Why purpose does the Academy serve?” Chunhua Cao asked.

—

“Here,” Tristan said, passing the note and the copper with it. “You remember the description?”

“You made me repeat it twice,” Arabella replied, rolling her eyes.

It should work, he thought. He’d implied he might want to use her services again so the girl was not too likely to simply take the copper and run. It would be throwing away future chances at coppers.

“Until next time, then,” the thief said, giving her a nod.

The little girl snorted, but she was smiling. It had been a lucrative day for her. Tristan walked away, pulling at the collar of his coat as Fortuna strolled alongside him. Now came the tricky part – he must get the timing just right for it to fall into the place the way he wanted it to. Tristan left Templeward Street for smaller alleys to its east running parallel, where there would be fewer eyes, and briskly made his way to the street behind Captain Wen’s house.

It was a dead-end alley, cramped and leading up to house’s high wall, but it had both things he needed: the goods he’d stashed and an easy climb into the house to the right of his patron’s. The back wall was old and poorly maintained, full of holes and loose masonry. Tucking the jug away, Tristan climbed up and shimmied in through the shutterless window. The inside of the house smelled like mildew and the roof was rotting, but as he’d earlier made sure most of the wooden floor was dry.

So when he emptied half a jug of oil on it and struck a match before tossing it, the whole thing went up in flames.

He corked the jug and hurried back out by the window, hid the oil behind a broken barrel and the matches with it. After that, while the fire began spreading and smoke poured out the windows, he looped around the backstreet and set himself in a side-alley to wait and watch as Sergeant Mandisa came out of front door in a hurry, half-dressed but fully armed, and went inside the burning house.

There was his opportunity.

The thief walked right through the open door and headed straight for the room he had clocked as Captain Wen’s, walking smoothly enough even in someone saw him they would not think twice of it.

Wen’s door had no lock on it, it was not nice enough a house to warrant such luxury, so he simply slipped inside and closed the door behind him before quietly asking Fortuna to stand guard on the other side. She shrugged, but her eyes were eager: it gave her an excuse to stare at the fire. She had always liked those.

Captain Wen’s room was fairly large but still felt cramped for the clutter – every shelf was filled to the brim, the bed unmade and there were piles of books on the floor. The writing desk in the corner seemed his best chance, but the papers piled on it weren’t what Tristan was looking for. There was a drawer, though. Locked.

It would have taken too long to look for the key, assuming it was even here, so the thief knelt and pulled out his tools. It was a pressure lock, cheap but simple, and in a matter of moments he had it popping open. Outside he could hear Sergeant Mandisa shouting, trying to organize a water chain for the fire, which meant time was running short. He put away the tools and opened the drawer. Papers, so many of them the drawer almost didn’t open.

Many were letters, Wen’s private correspondence, but at the bottom were a series of old contracts – most of them with Aztlan-sounding names – and four neat sheaths of paper. There were the dossiers, not only his own but that of the rest of the cabal. Five pages each. He pulled up his own. The first page was filling, his name and that of his parents, his physical appearance and what little the Watch knew of his origins.

That they even knew this much meant Abuela had passed them information, though he noted they marked his father as a cellist instead of a violinist.

The second sheet was an assessment of his skills, which seemed to have been penned in part by his teacher and then amended with comments regarding his performance on the Dominion. He was amused to see that overall his sneaking skills and ability to read others were highly praised but that he was noted to ‘talk too much’ – Wen’s opinion, at a guess – and he was noted to be physically lacking in direct confrontation.

Fair enough.

The third sheet was about his contract, which he was relieved to see was largely speculation. Though it appeared that the Watch had correctly pegged that that the telekinesis he sometimes used as his cover was not his true ability, the most prominent guess was that he a contracted with a minor god of the Murk to be able to become extremely precise in short bursts – the examples used were his reported miraculous throw of the piece of rhadamantine quartz and how he had survive passing through the deadly mechanical room in the Old Fort.

Fortuna avoiding Abuela like the plague had allowed him to keep that particular secret under wraps, an unexpected boon.

The fourth sheet was, to his surprise, empty. The heading mentioned that the recommendation that got him in Scholomance was meant to be part of the page, but there was only a line slashed across and nothing else. Odd. But there was no time to waste, so he briskly moved on to the fifth. It was, promisingly, titled ‘Items of Interest’. And it was an inventory of sorts, though not of what one might have expected.

Grudge against House Cerdan as a result of his father’s involvement in the forbidden research workshop known as ‘Theogony’, aimed primarily at contract stacking and the creation of a stable Saint.

His fingers clenched. A stable Saint – was that what that thing held up in golden chains was meant to be? His mind still trembled to remember that silhouette, but what was that success or failure?

Suspected to have slain a Cerdan retainer on the Dominion of Lost Things, Cozme Aflor. Body was found with poison burns corresponding to inventive use of a dosage box. Suspected involvement in the death of a minor Cerdan cousin, Remund Cerdan.

So they’d found Cozme’s body after all. He had not gotten away as clean as he’d thought.

Two sniffers have confirmed the contact to feel unusually strong, but a second-order entity for patron has been definitively ruled out. Confirmation is needed about whether he was a Theogony subject.

His brow rose. He had no notion of what a second-order entity might be, so he could not answer to that, but he had only once come anywhere close the horrors of Theogony and no hand was laid on him then. The oddness about his closeness with Fortuna had already been remarked on, however, and seemingly it was leading the Watch to wrong conclusions. He skimmed through a few more items before his gaze landed on the last. The most recent addition.

An informal bounty has been placed on his head. Officer Nerei has lodged an official complaint against the Ivory Library, accusing them of attempted abduction of a member of the Watch for experimental purposes. No actionable proof has been given and the Library denies the charges.

And a slight note beneath.

By order of Lord Asher, there is to be no interference in this matter.

Tristan hummed. Asher. He’d heard that name before, mentioned in passing by Hage. A high-ranking member of the Krypteia, it seemed. At least now he had a name for his enemy: the Ivory Library. The name bore investigation. The thief put his dossier back, then hesitated.

“Fortuna,” he whispered.

She popped in her head through the door.

“How is it looking?”

“They’ve realized the fire won’t spread but they’re still fighting to put it out,” she said. “They say the garrison is on their way. I’d give it a minute or two.”

That wasn’t long, but enough for some digging through other people’s secrets. Who? Maryam would tell him what she wanted in her own time so her dossier was set aside, but he elected to take a quick peek at the fifth sheet of the other two. And oh, what interesting reading that made for.

Tredegar first, she was closest at hand.

Gwydion Tredegar – her father, he learned by flipping back to the first sheet – was twice reported to the Watch for deliberately malicious bargaining and twice cleared through investigation. Testimony by Osian Tredegar marked him as the potential high priest to a Green Book god.

Worth knowing about: ‘deliberately malicious bargaining’ was crime of striking a bargain with a god for the purpose of causing harm to men, which was illegal under the Iscariot Accords. It was entirely possible that Angharad Tredegar’s father had left a god to watch over her. Was that how she had survived Brun and Yaretzi on the Dominion? It would explain much.

The snippet he caught of Song’s sheet was even more interesting, though.

Gestalt resentment from the Republics is in the process of giving birth to a curse-god aimed at the Ren bloodline. Requires regular Gloam purges and there are reports of increasing miscarriages and sicknesses in the family. Watch health closely to ascertain development.

So Song was cursed and growing more so. But before he could spare a second thought to the matter, Fortuna popped back in.

“The garrison’s here,” she said. “And it sounds like Wen is too.”

Time to end this, then. He put away the files but there was a sudden snap and he flinched, realizing a heartbeat later it had been part of the burning house next door collapsing. He’d still dropped part of Maryam’s dossier, and his eye caught a fragment of a sentence –ing daughter of Izolda Cernik– before wrenching his gaze away. The thief put away the papers, closed the drawer and rose to his feet.

He didn’t sneak out of the house but walk right out the front door where everyone could see. Why should he hide, when the only voice that mattered was going to cover for him?

It took a moment for him to be noticed, because there was a loud argument happening. Captain Wen, surprisingly bereft of a snack, was mocking a tall and skinny woman while a dozen garrison men and Mandisa looked on. The stranger was Lierganen in looks, dark-haired and with a prominent nose. Unless Tristan had gravely misjudged the situation, this was Dionora Cazal – patron to the Forty-Ninth Cabal and an old enemy of Wen Duan’s. A blackcloak stood next to her, separate from the rest, and kept wincing every few moments while the patrolmen directed unfriendly looks his way. Oh, she brought a witness. That’s even better.

Dionora was the first one to notice him.

“There,” she triumphantly said. “I told you the little shit was around. He must be the one responsible for-”

“Tristan Abrascal is here,” Wen cut through, “because I sent for him as his patron. He had worrying rumors to share with me, which I asked him to investigate.”

The thief did not look at Sergeant Mandisa, it would have given away the game, but after a heartbeat passed and she said nothing his shoulders loosened. Good, betting on her following Wen had been the correct solution. Between that and Sergeant Hotl being unlikely to admit he’d been bribed, much less twice, the trail was swept clean. Wen grinned, the unholy glee behind his spectacles a rival for any devil’s.

“Report, soldier,” he ordered.

Tristan approached, face utterly serious, and saluted.

“Sir,” he said. “I kept watch from a neighboring house and saw it happen: Dionora Cazal and a man in a black cloak went into the back alley, bearing a jug of oil. A few minutes later they left and hid.”

“Liar,” the woman hissed.

Her accomplice was hiding his face in his hands. Wen’s grin widened, showing ever more teeth.

“As I was explaining, lieutenant, I received a warning that Dionora might be trying to set my home on fire as retaliation for old slights and my cabal so blatantly outperforming hers,” the fat Tianxi said. “It appears we have caught her red-handed.”

So Wen had sent them to check the alley where Tristan had predicted they would be waiting to catch him, then. Another piece falling into place just right. The officer Wen was addressing, a frowning Someshwari man with eyes almost as pale as Tupoc’s, clicked his tongue in disapproval.

“Testimony from the boy is not enough, Captain Wen,” he replied. “He is himself being accused of trying to rob you.”

“Tristan Abrascal is an honest and reliable young man, Lieutenant Pazal,” Wen lied without batting an eye. “He would never do such a thing.”

The thief cleared his throat, getting a glance from the lieutenant. He painted an earnest look on his face.

“I didn’t see them leave with the oil jug, sir,” he said. “They might have left it behind.”

“That could be considered a form of proof,” Lieutenant Pazal conceded. “You two, search the backstreet. Everyone else is to stay here.”

The Aztlan seemed disinclined to small talk, not that it would have mattered with Wen coming over to the thief, making as if to comfort him by swinging an arm around his shoulder and taking a few steps away. Tristan would have disliked the touch even if it were gentle, which it was not.

“So?” Captain Wen asked.

“I planted the jug in the alley,” the thief murmured.

The Tianxi released him, sparing a glance for the rival glaring hatefully their way.

“Good.”

There was a pause.

“How did you know?” Wen asked. “That she would have someone in the detainment house, I mean.”

Because you speak her name like you’ve shouted it, Tristan thought, and that kind of hate isn’t a vine that grows solely on one side of the fence. Dionora Cazal would have wanted to know the moment anyone from the Thirteenth got in trouble again and the sergeant was the obvious one to buy.

“No one as bad at cards as Sergeant Hotl is going to turn away a bribe,” he said instead, which got a snort out of the Tianxi.

“I don’t suppose,” Wen said, “that you’d tell me why it is you’ve schemed up all this?”

Tristan cocked an eyebrow.

“For the same reason you chose to take us to the Chimerical on your first day, of all places,” he said.

Wen smiled, saying nothing. It had been a boon on the older man’s part, that introduction, even though it had not appeared so at the time and was subtle still. They watched as the watchmen that Lieutenant Pazal had sent into the alley came out bearing a half-empty oil jug. Dionora began shouting angrily about this being a frame-up, which admittedly it was. Not that it would help her.

“You know, when we were but a few years older than you she learned that the smell of vanilla makes me nauseous,” Captain Wen distantly said, eyes on her. “She baked fresh vanilla buns every day for a month after that, and sat upwind of me every class.”

That was, Tristan would admit, impressively petty.

“Today,” the large Tianxi decided as his rival was put under arrest, “is a good day.”

It was, Tristan agreed. Because even if Wen ended up figuring out that the thief had gotten into his papers, that the entire sequence – baiting Dionora Cazal with a message that implied she might be able to catch him stealing from his own patron red-handed, then paying Arabella to wait along the street Wen would take so he could stop halfway through and instead claim that he’d known an arson plot was afoot and Tristan was watching for it – had been cover, it wouldn’t matter.

From that unabated grin on Wen Duan’s face, his patron would call the breach a fair bargain anyway.

It was another ten minutes before Tristan was allowed to leave, but when he began walking back to the Chimerical it was with a spring to his step.

# Chapter 17

Musa Shange and his three were the first down.

Angharad would give him this: the man might be arrogant, but he was no coward. It was but moments after he disappeared down the stairs that the jockeying began, not for seats but for alliances. Now that it seemed certain all of them would journey down into the Acallar to fight everyone wanted to stand with the strongest they knew. Shalini pulled close, almost as if staking a claim, and Salvador had been sitting to their side the entire time.

“We should look into a fourth,” Shalini quietly advised. “Best to fill our ranks as much as possible.”

“Agreed,” Angharad murmured.

She did not believe herself unskilled with a blade, but there were monsters against which blades only helped so much. She flicked a glance as Salvador, who grunted in agreement. Good, she could begin looking for-

“Hello.”

Angharad’s hand still went for her saber after she saw who it was addressing them. Shorter than her and almost skinny, the Malani boy that Tupoc had introduced as ‘Expendable’ wore a particularly thick cloak and a wide-brimmed black hat that was pulled down to hide as much of his face as it could without obscuring his vision entirely. There was a hunter’s spear trapped to his back and an unusually thick pistol at his belt. Despite the hat Angharad could still see a slice of those strange eyes, black and amber like a wolf’s.

Even as he spoke and faced them, Expendable stared squarely down at the ground.

“Good afternoon,” Angharad stiffly replied.

One’s affiliation with Tupoc Xical was not sufficient reason for rudeness, against all odds.

“Tupoc said I should go to you if there’s fighting,” the Malani said. “That you owe him for the Dominion and for saving you earlier in class.”

“Untrue on both accounts,” the Pereduri coldly replied.

Expendable shifted uncomfortably on his feet.

“He says,” the boy coughed into his fist, “that it’s bad manners to be a welcher.”

Angharad twitched and her saber was an inch out when Shalini caught her wrist.

“Not here,” the gunslinger said. “We’re causing a scene.”

The noblewoman’s lips thinned as she realized that dozens were looking at the scene she was causing – Muchen He from the Forty-Ninth, was smirking – and she had likely chased off half their prospects for a fourth squadmate. Reluctantly, she sheathed the blade.

“That and he knows something about the death of someone called Isabela Ruest,” Expendable continued.

He had not so much as flinched, Angharad belatedly realized, even when she moved to bare steel. Had he not seen it for his staring at the ground? No, he must have.

He’d simply been unafraid.

“Do you perhaps mean Isabel Ruesta?” Shalini asked.

Expendable let out a noise of relief.

“That’s the one, yes,” he said. “Lierganen names, you know?”

“Preaching to the converted,” Shalini drily replied.

“What does he know that would matter?” Angharad demanded.

Expendable shrugged.

“He didn’t tell me,” the Malani answered. “But if you take me on for today, he’ll say.”

Angharad frowned. Isabel had died in battle, had she not? Tupoc had been there that night, but not anywhere near her as far as she could recall. Yet while the Izcalli was a liar and a man without honor, usually he bargained in good faith – if only so that others might bargain with him again. And if he offers this in bad faith, the noblewoman thought, I would be rid of any ties to him. She turned a look on Shalini, who sighed.

“What can you do?” the curvy Someshwari asked.

“I am good with a spear,” Expendable said, “and I have salt munitions for my pistol.”

“Contract?” Salvador rasped out.

“Yes,” the Malani flatly replied. “But it would best I do not use it.”

Curious as she was, Angharad did not step across the unspoken line.

“Fine,” Shalini said. “We’re looking too messy to draw in anyone good at the moment, so we might as well get someone whose death I would not mourn.”

That was a rather savage thing to tell a strange, the noblewoman thought, but Expendable did not seem moved in the slightest. Considering what Tupoc had named him, perhaps that should not be surprising. Salvador caught her eye and nodded, which along with Angharad’s own agreement settled the matter. There was no more time to talk, however, as someone let out an exclamation and she found that down below Musa Shange’s squad was readying for a fight.

The Marshal, showing no sign of leaving, let them pick their cage and opened it himself before getting out of the way.

After the onjancanu Angharad had expected some other great brute, but instead what came out was a blur of movement. Musa’s squad had been lying in wait and the two with muskets took their shots, but they hit nothing save the insides of the cage. It was the fourth, a woman with two silvery hatchets, who let them all get a good look at the lemure when she put them up just in time to catch the snapping jaws of a feathered, winged serpent.

It was an entirely different sort of fight from the Marshal’s. The lemure – which looked not unlike some of the drawings Angharad had seen of great Izcalli spirits – was no lumbering giant but a darting, poisonous little thing. It was no larger than a sheep and had no arms, but the feathers of its long tail were razor-sharp and its jaw was powerful enough to snap a musket when it caught one of the students unwary.

Several were cut, though the wounds were not too deep and they all avoided that deadly bite.

To Lord Musa’s honor, he quickly grasped that having spread out his squad was a mistake and that the creature would try to pick them off one by one. He gathered them all together, and when the lemure still risked an attack they finally caught it. The woman with the silver hatchets threw one, which missed, but then there was a flare of silver and the hatched came spinning back to her hand. The lemure banked down to avoid it, towards the floor, and there Musa caught it with his blade.

He went for the wings, prudently, and after the winged serpent could no longer fly a quick and inglorious death followed.

“I wonder why it did not try to flee,” Shalini mused. “No one could have stopped if it flew up.”

“Spirits can’t leave this place,” Expendable quietly said.

He had only looked at the fight with small glances, never a stare. Angharad frowned his way.

“Why?”

“I don’t know why,” the Malani replied. “I just know.”

Expendable spoke like a man from the Isles, not someone raised abroad, so she refrained from outright calling him a liar in the privacy of her own mind. He would have been taught better. Tough Angharad suggested they be the next down the stairs, but Shalini instead suggested they wait another two fights to get an idea of what the lemures faced might be like. It felt like profiteering to her, but the others were in agreement so she conceded the matter.

The second fight was much quicker: the lemure was a horse with two curved horns, and though it proved dangerous when it breathed out a gout of flame at the squad facing it the four killed it with practiced efficiency. Shot in the sides with muskets, then a spear to the head. It emboldened the next squad to venture down with only three.

Only one got out, and missing a leg.

A seemingly harmless lemure, looking like a boy whose lower half was a goat’s – though the upper half only seemed human, the way the muscles moved beneath all wrong – brutally took them apart. It danced out of the way of the shot that opened the fight, stole a blade and a cut Someshwari’s girl throat with it before she could even scream. Another of the three slammed a spear into its neck as he did, but the lemure stabbed him in the eye in return.

The neck was half-cut, head dangling listlessly, but there was no ichor in that flesh. Only cartilage.

Only when the last student shot it in the belly did the lemure let out a scream, a mouth opening in its belly with teeth like a goat’s horns, and it tore through the last student’s leg before the girl stabbed into it enough it ceased moving, screaming and weeping all the while. She had to be carried out by the blackcloaks keeping guard behind the grate, unconscious. Two more came and carried out the corpses as the Marshal waited, silent.

“Next,” he simply called out, looking at the stands.

A deadly stillness had fallen upon them as the corpses were carried out, every last whisper silenced as they faced the reality that their professor had watched two students die and third be crippled for life with polite disinterest. There was no secret safety here, no ancient device preventing deaths or making any of this safe.

This wasn’t a class, it was a culling.

Well, nothing for it. Angharad pushed off the railing, adjusted her coat and the sword at her side before checking her pistol. Perhaps she would even use it.

“Shall we?” she asked the others.

She got blank looks in return.

“Two and then we descend, that was the arrangement,” she reminded them.

“It was,” Shalini softly agreed, then licked her lips. “All right.”

Salvador’s face was a mask of calm, and as far as she could tell Expendable was only barely paying attention. Angharad nodded their way, then took the lead down the stone steps. She could feel the weight of the stares on their back, and again when she emerged out onto the broken grounds of the Acallar. The others followed behind, none of them in the mood to chatter.

The Marshal waited for them at the heart of it, and laughed when he saw them.

“Of course it would be you four.”

“I don’t follow, Marshal,” Angharad frowned.

“You’re a mirror-dancer, girl,” the old man said. “Unlike those children up there, you were never under the illusion that your life might not be on the line.”

“I expect disservice is being done,” she calmly replied.

The Marshal shrugged, then wordlessly invited her to choose a cage. Glancing back, Angharad found that none of the others seemed inclined to do so. The noblewoman eyed the closest cage and-

/a large golden lion prowled out, unblinking red eyes set in its fur/

-decided it would do.

“This one,” she pointed.

She knew not the beast, but she would much prefer something committed to the ground rather than bearing wings. The odds of her contributing to a victory with her pistol were unfortunately low.

“I will take the front,” Angharad said. “Shalini-”

“I’ll hold back until you have it in place, then unload,” the Someshwari said.

“I go with you,” Salvador said, catching Angharad’s eye.

She would have objected, but he shook his head.

“Hard to kill,” he smiled.

It would have been an insult to refuse him, so she set aside her concern.

“Then I will hit the flank,” Expendable muttered. “After-”

The cage opened, Marshal de la Tavarin having wrenched open the gate before retreating out of sight, and just like in Angharad’s glimpse a great lion prowled out. Expendable’s voice caught.

“Please let me kill it,” he suddenly said. “Cripple it and let me kill it.”

Eyes turned to him, baffled.

“Why-” Angharad began.

“For my contract,” he said. “It’s… I might be able to leave the Fourth if I kill it. Please.”

Shalini cursed.

“I make no promises,” Angharad said, then hesitated. “But if the opportunity comes, I will hold back from slaying it.”

A roar told made it plain that the time for talk was over.

The noblewoman shot forward, drawing her blade as she did. The monster, she saw, was closer in size to a bear than the lions of Malan – and inside the hair-like man unblinking red eyes watcher her approach even as it yawned, revealing its fangs. Its tail swept behind casually as Angharad closed the distance, choosing her angle, but to her surprise Salvador ran past her with his blade in hand.

“I’ll distract,” he croaked out.

Before she could reply the man turned blue and hazy – or so she thought, before realizing that Salvador was the same but leaving a trail. Contract. She adjusted her approach, circling towards the left as most of the lemure’s eyes turned to the Sacromontan. What followed she almost missed, so quickly did it happen.

Salvador had gotten close, enough to dart in with his sword, but the lion lazily stepped past the blow. Then one of the red eyes burst, spit out like dart of blood that hit the Sacromontan in the stomach and ripped right through. Angharad would have shouted, but the man flickered blue and heartbeat later he was elsewhere entirely.

Behind her, when he had first stood when he’d begun leaving a trail, and entirely unharmed.

Angharad’s eyes widened at the implication, but she had no more time to spare than that. The lemure had turned its attention on her, leaping,  and a glimpse told her to follow her sidestep by a roll as another eye burst and tried to clip her shoulder. Instead she rose into a strike at the beast’s back leg, scoring a blow on skin that proved tough as old leather. She cut it, but not deep enough for ichor.

Roaring, the lion turned to swipe at her and that was when Shalini Goel unloaded into its side.

Four shots, in such quick succession Angharad could barely tell them apart. The lion screamed, but she could hardly hear it with the racket made by dozens of cages suddenly being rattled by the beasts inside them. Salvador had returned to the lemure’s back, hazy once more, and Angharad spared a heartbeat to notice that he seemed exceedingly careful about never stepping in his own trail.

After that, it was a dance with the mirror.

The beast was fast and tricky, once almost tearing Salvador’s throat out after he snapped back to the beginning of his trail, but Expendable was keeping an eye on them – he shot the beast in one of its eyes, then forced it away with his spear. They were quick on their feet, however, and Shalini was one-woman artillery. She never ventured too close, waiting until they trapped the beast to tear into it with her pistols.

Soon the lemure was bleeding from every side, more meat than monster, and to Angharad’s disgust it began to fall apart. The same red it had shot at them with began wriggling out of control, an entire leg turning into a puddle of blood suddenly, and after a few more careful blows from the lion was soon no more than a wriggling, pulsating mass of flesh and blood.

It was no longer fighting, at least, and the others joined her to catch their breath. They had a few scrapes and Expendable’s coat was ripped, but otherwise they were unharmed.

“I am unsure how to kill this,” Angharad admitted, eyeing the red. “Salt munitions?”

“No need. I’ll end it.”

She turned to Expendable, who for once was standing straight. He began advancing towards the lion, undoing his cloak and letting it drop before tossing his spear and pistol the same way.

“What are you doing?” Angharad called out, baffled.

“Using my contract,” Expendable replied, and took off the hat. “Don’t come close, I won’t be in control.”

His eyes, Angharad saw, were no longer like a wolf’s.

The Malani boy even took off his tunic and his boots, advancing in hose towards the wriggling lion remains. He looked a madman, until the first spasm. As he screamed hoarsely Expendable’s right arm wrenched back and burst into claws and fur with a wet squelch. Convulsing, screaming in pain, another form burst out of the boy one squelch at a time. Long clawed legs and a striped coat, a thick chest and large triangular ears a dog’s muzzle.

It would have looked like a hyena, if they grew the size of carriages.

No, Angharad knew what this was and so she did not dare to move so much as an inch. The black stripes on the monster’s coat rippled like living shadow, snaking along the ground, and as the creature let out a cackle she blurred – and emerged at the tip of the extended shadow, sending a shiver down Angharad’s spine.

“Gods,” Shalini whispered. “What is that?”

“Doom-caller,” she whispered back, dry-mouthed. “Ukusini.”

The Slow Death, they were called by some, for the ukusini took their time slaughtering caravans – snatching and bleeding, not because they could not murder their way through the lot in moments but to make the caravan into a larder of meat and terror. Ancestors, how had this boy come into a contract that turned him into one? The monster fell onto the wounded one with relish, tearing into the flesh and gobbling it up.

It didn’t make it quick.

The ukusini turned towards them, when the last strip of flesh was devoured, and let out a shuddering cackle. Angharad swallowed, taking a careful step back. Would the Marshal step in, if it were a student attacking them and not a lemure? She was not to find out, for instead of advancing the creature let out a dismayed cry and began to convulse. It was the horror they had seen earlier in the reverse, flesh and bone and tendon sucked into a too-small body as the ukusini was forced back inside Expendable.

The boy was left lying on the ground, completely naked.

Angharad had thought that the end of it, for a moment, but Expendable kept convulsing. Things moved under his skin as he wriggled on the ground, gasping, until the sudden end. He stayed there for a moment, until he closed his eyes and slammed his fist against the ground.

“Fuck,” he snarled. “Fuck. How is it not strong enough, Sleeping God fucking damn you.”

When he opened his eyes they were wolflike again and he looked set to weep. He gathered himself to sit with little regard to his modesty.

“It’s done,” Expendable tired said. “Thank you for trying.”

Shalini brought him his cloak and hat, something like pity on her face, and they picked up his affairs before leaving together. They were taken to the guardhouse, patched up and sent back to the stands. They sat there, watching as the hour stretched and cages opened one after another. By the time the fights ended, six people had died and three were wounded badly enough they had to be taken away.

When the Marshal called them down, the sixty-six remaining students were silent as the grave they were standing on.

“Do you know our words, Maryam Khaimov?”

Captain Yue looked like ease put to canvas: she was barefoot and wearing a billowy white shirt, lying back on a black coat laid atop the grass. With her thick black braid pulled to the side, Maryam could not see the burn scars she knew were on her cheek and ear. And the older signifier’s brown eyes, however half-lidded their gaze, studied her without blinking.

“Beyond the Horizon,” Maryam recited.

She sat cross-legged in the grass facing the other woman, cloak pulled tight around her like a shield.

“That’s right,” Captain Yue agreed. “We inherited those, did you know? I’ll spare you the twists and turns of history, but our lineage as a guild can be traced back to Second Empire officials called the cazadores.”

Maryam frowned. She had known of the Akelarre Guild’s ancient roots but its rise to prominence had only begun well into the Succession Wars – why cling to such a distant past? Her bemusement was visible enough to warrant answer.

“They weren’t Gloam-users but mapmakers,” the captain said, sounding strangely amused. “Their role was to explore past the borders and chart the lands there so that the emperors of Liergan might better plan their conquests.”

The blue-eyed woman mulled over that.

“So when Liergan grabbed everything under Glare they could reach, that meant going out into the dark,” Maryam said. “They turned into Gloam-users.”

“That and a mystery cult,” Captain Yue said. “The Orden de Cazadores got into its head that it was going to save us all by finding a land beyond the horizon where the Gloam could not reach, a paradise beyond even the reach of gods.”

It sounded not unlike what her people called the Nav – but that was a land for the dead, not the living.

“I have not heard of such a place,” Maryam said.

“They found Hell instead,” the Tianxi drily replied. “Bit of disappointment, I imagine.”

Maryam twitched, surprised that even through her nerves she could be amused. Captain Yue did have a way about her. It was the calm, the Izvorica figured. The older woman seemed so deeply unmoved by the world around her you could not be helped to be drawn into her pace.

“If they failed, why do we keep their words?” Maryam asked. “The Guild has folded hundreds of practitioner cults into itself over the years. Surely one would better deserve the honor.”

“The words stayed because they don’t mean the same thing they used to,” Captain Yue said. “After they found Pandemonium, the Orden cult broke. It only knit back anew under a new dream.”

The Tianxi theatrically swept her arms out.

“To find the edges of the world,” she said. “It is only logical, Maram: we have firmament above and the ground below our feet, but Vesper has walls. Limits. The last of the cazadores and those who came after themwanted to chart the entire world, know the span of it and hold it in their palm.”

She shrugged.

“So a-chasing they went.”

“And we carry that dream still?” Maryam asked, honestly surprised. “That is not much like Captain Totec taught me, or even what I learned on the Blind Isle.”

“Some of us do,” Captain Yue said. “But that dream bled out, Maryam, for the same reason so many other things have: the Succession Wars.”

The shadow cast on every lesson about mornarichistory, the great wars that had ravaged their realms and scarred them deep. The Triglau had known war, both within their peoples and with the broken kingdoms beyond the Dead Lands, but never anything so shattering. What rank madness it would be, to lessen the lights of the world when there were already so few.

“War took away the taste for such pursuits, I take it,” Maryam said.

“It did a lot more than that,” Captain Yue smiled.

She had not moved an inch, yet the Izvorica could not help but feel there was no longer anything casual about the way she was lying on the ground.

“When half of Old Liergan went dark, it ripped the veil off our delusions of supremacy,” the Tianxi said. “The Watch, it was born from that sudden anguished realization that we’ve been at war with the encroaching dark since we first fled down into Vesper and that, despite our most desperate efforts, we are losing.”

The simple, heartfelt belief in that last word shivered across the Meadow. Captain Yue had spoken it without room for a speck of doubt. The older woman pushed herself up, legs crossing in a mirror of Maryam’s, and rolled her shoulders.

“But listen to me rambling, and after saying I’d spare you the history!” the Tianxi sighed. “Here’s the important part: by the reckoning of the finest minds of our order, only somewhere around a third of Vesper exists under the Glare.”

The blue-eyed woman felt her stomach clench in unease. She had never heard a number put to such a thing before, and the one she was being told was distressing. Maryam not thought most of the world would be under light, but surely at least close to half? A mere third sounded… fragile. Captain Yue, far from distressed, seemed enthused.

“What you have to understand, Maryam, is that the rest of the Watch are poor doctors,” she said. “They hunt the evils of the world and measure them as if it that can save anything, but all that attends to is the symptoms.”

She shrugged.

“It is not unworthy work, and some of necessary, but at the end of the day they cannot face the reality that two thirds of the world is the province of Gloam,” she said.

And that let Maryam put it together. Captain Totec had not come to the land of her birth as an explorer, not really. And there was a reason he had taken her under his wing even knowing it would offend the Malani.

“But we do,” she said. “The horizon in our guild’s words, it’s not one that can be sailed to.”

“No,” Captain Yue agreed, sounding pleased. “It’s the horizon that’ll find us, sooner or later: the last third going dark. And when that day comes, if there is anything to remain of us, then we need to have mastered Gloam. Made it ours. Else none of us will ever see what lies beyond that horizon.”

She raised her hand, clenched it into a fist.

“The Signs, all they are is an alphabet,” the captain said. “One that in time will make the words of the language that will be mankind’s salvation.”

The Tianxi opened her fist, revealing a ball of roiling Gloam that she snuffed out with a single breath.

“But that work will not be finished in our time,” she said. “We pass it on, Maryam. We learn and write and pass the book so that those after us might finish the page.”

The Izvorica kept silent. She could already smell the refusal, or worse. What could she add to this Akelarre book? She doubted there was a single signifier in the Abbey that could not make at least twice as many Signs as she.

“That’s why Baltasar is wrong about you,” Captain Yue mildly said.

Blue eyes snapped to her.

“He’s a brilliant signifier of the Watch, and a fine instructor, but that is all he is,” the older woman said. “I imagine he was quite dismissive of whatever Triglau tradition saw you obscure your brain before puberty.”

Maryam swallowed, mouth gone dry.

“He was.”

Not unkindly, but he had been.

“That’s where he fails,” Captain Yue smiled. “He sees that, sees how your Grasp and Command are absurd, and sees someone who cannot excel at what he is to teach.”

The captain folded her arms.

“He should be wondering, instead, what it is you weremade to excel at,” she said. “There is a mystery in you, Maryam Khaimov, and mysteries have been the death of many a signifier.”

The dark-eyed Tianxi bared her teeth.

“But they’re also how we fill the page.”

“And what would that mean, for me?” Maryam quietly asked.

“You give me two afternoons a week,” Captain Yue said. “I’ll assign you readings and exercises. Sometimes, I will take measurements.”

“But you’ll fix my signifying,” the Izvorica said.

“Oh, I’ll do more than that,” the Tianxi chuckled.

She leaned back, fingers riffling through the pockets of the coat on the grass. She slid out a folded paper, which she handed Maryam. The blue-eyed woman opened it, throat catching as she read the lines. It was a report from a garrison officer, a lieutenant describing the encounter he’d had last night near a red line in Port Allazei.

And unless there was another pale-skinned signifier on the island, it was her being described out there in the middle of the night.

“I had it buried,” Captain Yue idly said. “Officially, you were out on business for me.”

And you’ll keep burying it, Maryam understood, so long as I do what you say. She licked her lips. That alone was enough to leverage her even if she were not already desperate.

“Can you really help?” she asked.

“I’ve been called a lot of things, over the years,” Captain Yue said. “Witch, bitch, the butcher of Caranela, a hundred different variations of madwoman and even ‘Necalli with tits’ the once, but there’s one thing they’ve never called me and that’s a liar.”

There was a glint in her eyes, something and dark and cold but not cruel – at least no crueler than a deep river was when it drowned the unwary.

“Help me understand why you have twice lived through something we believe to be certain death,” she grinned. “And I’ll make sure you’ve mastered enough Signs to stay on next year.”

Maryam chose the side of the coin she could live with, and shook the devil’s hand.

—

Hage was cleaning the counter when Tristan came in.

The devil glanced at him, cocked an eyebrow and then went around the counter. Mephistofeline was sleeping by the front window, his dainty snores blowing off little motes of dust with every breath. Fortuna hurried to him immediately, trying to wake him with a sudden shout that had Tristan tensing but the cat only flopping belly up and stretching a bit without ever ceasing to snore.

“You have made a deadly enemy today, Prince Mephistofeline,” Fortuna hissed. “I’ll have you know an entire language was once crafted for the sole purpose of making hymns in my name and that-”

Fighting down the secondhand embarrassment and habitually glad no one else could hear the goddess, Tristan slid into a seat facing Hage. The devil set down his rag, leaning a single elbow against the counter and cocked one of those impressive eyebrows.

“I read my dossier,” Tristan said. “What do you want to know?”

“What did your father do for a living?” Hage asked.

“They have him marked a cellist.”

The devil hummed.

“Who put a price on your head and why?”

“The Ivory Library,” the thief replied. “And it didn’t say why, but it did mention that Officer Nerei complained that it was an abduction of a Watch member for the purposes of experimentation.”

His face remained unreadable. Tristan supposed that was easier, when the only facial expressions you had were those you faked with mandibles under skin.

“Tell me an Item of Interest,” Hage said, “for another member of your cabal.”

Tristan widened his eyes and put on an offended air.

“Why would you think I looked at their private matters?” he said.

The devil leaned in.

“Is that your final answer?”

The thief grimaced.

“Song’s family is so hated a curse-god is forming from that hate,” he said.

Hage hummed again.

“Why did you not simply ask Wen instead of making an elaborate plot with a fire?”

“Because if he refused he’d be on the lookout for me and all my other guesses at where dossiers are would be much better defended,” Tristan honestly replied.

The devil had mentioned four transcripts. Hage would have one as a Krypteia teacher, Wen would have one as patron of their brigade and likely that office in the port with all the papers would have one as well. The most likely guess for the fourth transcript was the Ninth Brigade, whose princeling might have leaned on the local garrison to get a copy of the Thirteenth’s transcripts after Angharad batted around their finest swordsman.

No, it’d been Wen or Hage from the start and however clever the bespectacled Tianxi was he was nowhere as dangerous as the old devil. Said devil wiped the wet rag across his counter once more.

“You qualify for my lessons,” Hage conceded.

Tristan hid his relief.

“You will work afternoon shifts here twice a week as a cover,” the devil said. “And I will assign you work to fulfill on your own time.”

The thief’s brow rose.

“Am I going to be paid for the labor?”

“Poorly,” Hage happily replied.

It figured. Fortuna, having tired of swearing gruesome revenge on a sleeping animal whose brain was the size of a handful of nuts, drifted their way. She slumped on the counter theatrically, hair sweeping to the side.

“We must retreat,” she told him. “I need to summon my legions, Tristan, for these insults cannot be borne. We may have to burn this place to the ground.”

The gray-eyed man cleared his throat.

“Are we done for the day, then, sir?” he asked.

“No,” Hage said. “And there will be no burning my shop.”

It took him a second for the words to truly sink in. Tristan stilled, blood going cold, and as Fortuna pushed herself up to look at the devil the ancient monster lazily stretched out his hand and flicked her forehead.

And without a sound, she was gone. Disappeared.

“You could see her,” Tristan choked out. “Hear her. This whole time?”

Hage gave a twofold smile, teeth behind teeth.

“Why were you ever so sure I could not?”

The thief licked his lips.

“She’s…”

“Dismissed,” Hage said. “I expect better manners of her should she enter the Chimerical again.”

Would it have hurt? Could Fortuna hurt, the way a human could? Even when they had faced that sliver of the Red Maw, she’d not seemed on the back foot the way she had been just now.

“There are some Masks on this island who would take you on simply because of who recommended you,” the devil said. “That is the worth of Nerei’s name. But I’ve found that while she has a knack for finding exceptional prospects, she doesn’t really prepare them.”

Hage studied him.

“She breaks off the part that wouldn’t fit under the mask, then tosses them our way,” the devil said. “I rather dislike that method.”

That last sentence, Tristan thought, had been spoken in the same venomously casual tone he thought the devil might use while chewing on someone’s leg.

“Entering the Krypteia should always be choice, not a shipwreck,” Hage said.

“Was it for you?” Tristan quietly asked.

“Oh yes,” the old devil smiled. “Hell did not cast me out, boy. I walked out of Pandemonium’s gates with my head held high.”

He licked his lips.

“Why?” Tristan asked. “The Watch was besieging Hell, wasn’t it? They must have called you a traitor when you walked.”

“To tell you the stories that would let you understand a genuine answer might take days,” Hage said. “But a simplification is this: I believe in what the Krypteia is.”

“And what’s that?” the thief asked.

Tone forcefully casual, but the question was utterly serious. Hage laid a hand on the rag, though he did not wipe with it again.

“Our world, Tristan Abrascal, is a graveyard.”

The devil leaned in, voice smooth as silk.

“There are empires in the dark whose rise and fall you shall never hear a whisper from, wonders and horrors buried beneath our feet whose like we will never see again,” Hage said. “We built our homes on the ashes of a hundred broken kingdoms and for those who know how to listen the wind still echoes of that merciless fire.”

The devil’s fingers clenched around the rag,

“The great powers forget, as all power does, the sea of blood that saw them rise,” he said. “In every corner of Vesper ambitious souls sharpen their swords and dream of empire, unheeding of the simple truth that they can only hold the world if it is made small enough to fit the palm of their hand.”

Tristan thought of the grim look on Professor Iyengar’s face, that morning. Of that matter-of-fact tone. More soldiers died in the first two weeks of the Succession Wars than over the entire span of the entire Kuril Dance, she’s said.

“Izcalli burns while Sacromonte butchers,” Hage scorned. “Tianxia apes broken miracles and Malan tries to steal entire kingdoms out of sight. The Imperial Someshwar? If it breaks, it breaks Vesper with it – and it would be worse if it did mend itself.”

All five of the great powers cut in a handful of sentences, though by some counts the Watch was considered the sixth and the devil had spared it.

“All of them digging and digging and cutting deals with whatever god might listen so that when wars comes – not just war but the war– they’ll be kings of the ashes.”

“And our spying on them will change that?” he asked, disbelieving.

Hage shook the head he wore.

“The Krypteia are not spies, Tristan, though we spy. Nor are we thieves, though we steal, or even assassins though we have murdered men like a man cuts grass.”

The devil’s voice was flat.

“We are gravekeepers.”

“That could mean anything,” the gray-eyed man challenged.

“It means,” Hage said, “that we make sure the things that should not be exhumed stay buried deep, that all those grasping hands never break the seal on the wrong tomb. We tend the grounds, cutting the throats of the intrepid and burning the libraries of the too-curious, so that the horrors we half-broke the world to murder stay sleeping in their graves.”

Tristan swallowed.

“Without us, there is no Watch worth the name,” Hage said. “Every other part of it, covenant and conclave and companies, they are the limbs and blood of the beast. We are the duty, the reason it was born.”

The devil put away his rag, temper soothed – though not before he had torn strips with his grip.

“You will not get to be proud and brave and true, Tristan Abascal,” Hage calmly said. “To swagger like a Militant or earn a Stripe’s accolades, to make and learn like a College man.”

Those were never a choice, Tristan thought. He was no soldiers, no scholar, not even a captain. He’d half-tried his hand at it once and how many of those he had banded with on the Dominion made it through?

Only the one already a blackcloak.

“We will ask damned, ugly things of you before this is done,” the devil said. “The kind you won’t even find it in you to whisper to those you love in the small hours of the morning.”

There was something almost hypnotic about Hage’s voice, the way he spoke.

“You will be taught to stare into every shadow and find the lie in every miracle, to trust neither love nor blood and taste even the finest meals for poison. What we teach will wound you, somewhere deep, in ways that you cannot yet understand.”

“And this,” he said, dry-mouthed, “is meant to entice me into joining up?”

“No,” Hage said. “This is.”

The devil caught his eyes.

“Here is the promise of our order: we will use you, Tristan Abrascal, to snuff out a hundred Theogonies.”

The boy’s fingers clenched.

“To slit their throats and set their works aflame,” Hage said. “To bleed out the poison they would spread. In that work we heed no border and obey no law, care not for crowns or gods or how many bodies pile up.”

The old devil’s voice was almost gentle.

“We will barter everything of what we are, what you will be, save for one thing: we hunt the night, and all that would bring it.”

Hage stepped back.

“Think on it,” he said. “Come back tomorrow.”

Tristan had hardly spoken, but he was the one who felt out breath. But it didn’t matter, did it? Time was of no use to him, it was already too late. When I found you, Abuela had said on the ship, our hunt was already carved into your bones.

“There’s nothing to think on,” Tristan said, laying a hand palm up on the counter. “The choice was already made.”

His hand was larger than it had been back then, he thought.

Maybe one day it would mean more than grasping a larger tile.

—

‘What purpose does the Academy serve?’

Song pondered Colonel Cao’s question as her fellow students tried and failed to answer it. Some tried to get clever – ‘to teach’, ‘to make Stripes’ – while others attempted more elaborate answers that were more seriously entertained by both their teacher and the assembly. In the end, however, it was an unfortunately familiar place that elicited a reaction from their teacher.

“The Academy is the true ruling organ of the Watch,” Captain Sebastian Camaron said.

“Oh?” Colonel Cao exhaled. “I did not expect anyone to come so close.”

The man, to his honor, did not outwardly preen. He simply smiled and leaned back into his armchair like a satisfied cat. Were he less pretty it would have looked smug, but he had been blessed with good looks so instead it looked confident. There was nothing worse than a pretty boy who knew it, Song thought.

“It can be said that the Academy’s purpose is to run the Watch,” the colonel elaborated, “and that is the first half of the answer. The second half, naturally, is the why.”

She gestured at the room around them, drink in hand.

“Is it ambition that drives us as a covenant?” Colonel Cao asked them. “Duty, tradition, any of half a dozen other pretty words?”

No one quite dared to risk an answer as the older Tianxi set down her drink

“It is not a simple question to answer, but the effort is worth it. We begin with the two contrary, unpleasant truths of our order: the Watch needs to exist and the Watch cannot be governed.”

That was a bold statement to make, and it landed into utter silence.

“Consider how the order stands,” Colonel Cao invited them. “The Conclave rules us, but who is it made of?”

She flicked a finger at her drink, the noise resounding in the room.

“The captain-generals of free companies spread across half of Vesper, who if not for the rules of the cloak would be as likely to war with each other as the night,” the colonel said. “The many lieutenant-generals of the Garrison, each a jealous petty king elbowing at their rivals for a greater cut of the treasury.”

Song was amused to notice that quite a few faces in the room had soured. As well they should, considering who had sent them to Scholomance.

“Even if the Conclave had half as many seats it would struggle to make decisions,” Colonel Cao said. “It hasn’t been able to elect a Grand Marshal since the Century of Dominion, and smirking men will tell you it is all on purpose, that this way more power remains in the hands of the Conclave, but that is a shallow conceit.”

She sneered.

“No one would be able to get one elected even if they tried, the votes simply split too many ways.”

The colonel raised a finger, as if to ward off objections.

“That is why we have committees, you will say,” she said, and indeed there was a faint rumble of agreement. “The Conclave is too large, goes the argument, so it gives authority to smaller, leaner assemblies that may exercise its will.”

Colonel Cao did not hide her disdain at the notion.

“As if that were not merely cutting up fresh fiefdoms in an order that’s made up a thousand too many.”

That argument, Song noted, was landing better with the free company students than the Garrison ones. Not unexpected, considering the Garrison was much closer to the Conclave as a rule – most of its funding came through it.

“You’re not to be Laurels so we don’t get lost in the philosophy, and you’re not to be Masks so don’t go chasing shadow plots,” Colonel Cao said. “Authority is a coin minted in gold and steel, and if you follow these you will find that the Watch creaks because it is ever pulling itself apart.”

A hard smile.

“The free companies chafe under the rule of the distant Conclave, which they say takes gold and gives precious little back. They fight and die on foreign shores while bureaucrats feed their rewards to ingrate militias.”

More than a few smiles from the free company crews, but that was unlikely to last.

“The Garrison complains that they must clip their wings to appease the captain-generals, who hoard wealth and glory so they might have no rivals. All the while they suffer insults for doing the duties glory hounds cannot be bothered to.”

As if a lever had been pulled, the smiles moved to the other side of the room.

“The Conclave complains it faces a hundred demands and no compromises, both sides of the abyss complaining of the tightrope it must walk.”

No one seemed taken with that particular position, Song mused, which in a way went to prove the colonel’s point.

“At the end of the day,” Colonel Cao said, “policies that benefit the free companies often hinder the Garrison and the reverse is equally true. Compromise displeases both sides and appeasement only whets appetites.”

She took her drink in hand again.

“So why hasn’t the Watch come apart at the seams? You wonder.”

She drank, set it down.

“We are why,” the colonel said, and though she did not raise her voice something about it had everyone sitting at attention.

“There is a Stripe in every free company, every fortress, every session of the Conclave,” Colonel Cao said. “We sit at every table, speak at every council and conspiracy of the black.”

She leaned forward.

“We do not merely raise officers but induct them, for when one gains great success they are invited to study at the Academy,” she said. “We bring in the influential and stack committees, teach Stripe to promote Stripe. We’ve spent centuries and mountains of gold on making the Watch a culture, from something as simple as the color of our cloaks to establishing jargon enough it might as well be a different dialect.”

The colonel smiled, unpleasantly.

“We are not a covenant, children, we are aconspiracy.”

And despite the severity of her expression, whispers bloomed at that. How could they not?

“You want to know what our purpose is? The Academy is the largest, richest and best organized conspiracy on Vesper and its sole purpose is to ensure that the Watch keeps functioning.”

The colonel laughed.

“It’s why we’re larger than all the other covenants put together, why every time we overstep and offend the others never sink the knife too deep,” she said. “Because they know that, for all our arrogance, without us it falls apart.”

The dark-haired woman leaned back against the counter.

“We make free companies share bids instead of fighting for contracts,” Colonel Cao said. “We make garrisons send their powder to their rivals instead of hoarding them, break deadlocks and broker compromises and do everything necessary ensure that the cogs keep turning no matter how many grains of sand get stuck.”

The older Tianxi wagged a finger in warning.

“It doesn’t matter who sent you here, whom you owe and what they want,” she said. “You are Stripes, now. You have a higher calling, a duty to make the decisions that need to be made so that the wall between Vesper and horror keeps standing.”

The colonel snorted.

“Look around you,” she ordered. “Some of those faces will belong to rivals and enemies, for that is the nature of ambition. But do not ever forget, not for one moment, that those enmities are personal. That they must be set aside for the greater good of the Watch, no matter how bitter the pill to swallow.”

She drank the last of her drink, bringing down the cup.

“And you will swallow that pill,” Colonel Chunhua Cao flatly said. “Or soon you will find yourselves out in the cold, and believe me – after being inside, there is no worse place to be.”

—

Marshal de la Tavarin sat on his wall, the rest of them standing beneath him on the same grounds where six of them had died over the last hour.

“As the man charged to initiate you into the Skiritai, I am meant to teach you our ways,” he informed them. “As all the teachers sent by covenants will, each of them giving you tests and speeches and sharing little secrets.”

He snorted.

“Nowadays, well, the Watch isn’t what it used to be,” the Marshal said. “Like an old lion grown more mane than mangle. We’ve been at the top too long, children, it’s made some of us tack on some fancy notions to the truth of what we are.”

He idly twirled his cane.

“Now, the Stripes they like to think they run the Watch and through it the world,” he flashed a grin. “Most of the time it’s worth it to let them keep thinking that so you don’t have to deal with the forms.”

A sigh.

“The College is all questions,” the Marshal said. “What’s this light, law, this clock? And yet somehow they forget to ask the most important question of all.”

He leaned it, to the very edge of the wall.

“Who’s paying for all this?”

There was a spatter of laughter in which Angharad did not share.

“Masks are spies you don’t get to hang, which is the worst sort of spies,” the Marshal continued. “You’ve got to rattle their cage now and then, remind them that blackmail only works if the other side doesn’t put a bullet in your brains.”

Only for the end of the list did he straighten.

“The Akelarre, our cousins in the Guildhouse, they’re sensible enough,” he praised. “You can count on them in a tight spot, if they don’t end up melting their brains.”

He wrinkled his nose.

“The trouble is their witch’s circle is older than the Watch, and sometimes they forget they’re part of it. Don’t complain too much about that, though, since they pay most of our bills.”

The laughter was even thinner on the ground. Nervous would only squeeze so much out of them.

“All these other covenants, they’ll tell their children they’re what keeps the Watch going,” Marshal de la Tavarin informed them. “They’re the most important part, the crowning glory. I’m not here to tell you that, because the truth’s a little simpler: in every way that matters, you are the Watch.”

This time when he smiled there was nothing roguish or foolish about it. It was a cold slice of ivory and silver.

“Everything else exists to serve us,” the Marshal said. “The other covenants were made to arms us, to inform us, to find our enemies and bring us where we need to be to kill them. They are the spear-carriers of the Skiritai Guild, nothing more or less.”

He exhaled dismissively, mustache fluttering.

“Our order’s gotten long in the tooth so all these philosophers sprang out of the woodwork to tell you all the special things that the Rooks are,” he contemptuously said, “but those are just words. Our order is a gun, and you are the bullet: without you there is no point.”

It sounded true, Angharad thought. And sensible enough

“You are Militants: the god-reaping sickle, the silver swords of Iscariot. The army that thrice slew Lucifer and shut the gates of Hell.”

Angharad straightened, as did many around her. Thrice? She had only heard of two.

“Look around you, at this fine fellowship of valor,” the Marshal encouraged. “Take it in.”

It was a hesitant thing, but smiles were shared. They died at the words that followed.

“By the time you leave Scholomance, half of those you see will be dead.”

You can’t be serious, someone called out, and many mutters matched it. Not that the old man seemed displeased.

“Why, children,” he grinned in silver, “did you think we came by all those fancy titles by accident?”

He set his cane on his lap.

“It takes seven years of flawless service or a victory against impossible odds to be considered for the Skiritai, out there in Vesper,” the Marshal said. “Scholomance is different, you’ll tell me. We are the finest, the handpicked, the chosen.”

He shrugged, as if conceding the point.

“That you were,” he agreed. “You were chosen to undertake a process that makes only two things: corpses and silver swords.”

Angharad was not sure she would truly have believed him, had she not seen blackcloaks drag out six corpses in the span of an hour. Now she knew better.

“They gave me five years to make Militants out of you, and that leaves no hour to spare for kindness,” the Marshal said.

His tone was mild, conversational.

“I will burn weakness out of you, children,” Marshal de la Tavarin said. “Cruelly and ways that will scar you for the rest of your days. But it will never be without purpose, and those of you who survive will be worthy of being called Skiritai.”

This time he did not get so much as a whisper.

“I tell you true, this is your first and last warning,” the old man said. “So go back to your beds, children and decide if the reason you’re here is worth risking your head. I will allow students to withdraw until the hour of tomorrow’s class.”

His mouth smiled, but not his eyes.

“After that, the only way out you can leave is in a coffin.”

# Chapter 18

Chapter 18

Song was the first back to the cottage.

She came in, wiped her boots and hung her cloak. Her musket was placed against the wall – until a proper weapons rack could be acquired – and she put away her powder in a bag she had hung from the wall for that very purpose. The sword belt joined the cloak as the last step, but for once putting away her affairs in an orderly matter brought no comfort. She felt… she wasn’t sure, in truth. Empty? Perhaps simply tired. It had been a long day.

The Tianxi made her way to the kitchen, trussed up her sleeves and got started on the evening meal. Chicken, rice and fresh tomatoes. No spices save salt, which was cheap and plentiful in Allazei. Her mother would have disowned her for a meal like this, but though it was simple fare the portions would be plentiful and it was not difficult to cook. It could serve as a placeholder. By the end of the week Song intended to begin a rotation so that responsibility for meals might not be entirely on her shoulders, alternating between the members of her brigade.

She had also been considering a chore sheet, considering the amount of work yet in need of doing. The cottage was still filthy, the library needed to be catalogued, the garden emptied of weeds, furniture needed to be bought and carried… the list went on. And though Song knew that when she was finished with the meal she should change into the work clothes she’d acquired in town and get to cleaning, the thought was frail. As if she were not certain of her own intentions, as if she were…

“I am not buckling,” Song hissed down at the pot of rice.

So there had been a setback. Colonel Cao had marked her a fool before her entire set of peers at Scholomance and her name would remain on that board until she erased her shame. That did not mean she would fail. It had been a lesson she must learn and the sting would only help her remember. The colonel was right, her approach had been lukewarm: she had neither hidden what she deduced to secure an advantage nor revealed it to everyone so she might earn gratitude.

The worst of both worlds: she well deserved the loss of a point.

Song set to preparing the chicken, carefully cutting and sprinkling with salt as she went. It went into an iron pot which was placed over the flame. Her distress, she decided, was only because she needed to purge the curse. She would ask Maryam to have a look tonight. It had not been long since the last purging, but it may be that Tolomontera – a great aether well, she had been told – made matters worse. Yet what she needed even more than that was a plan. A way forward, a way to rise.

Song did not anticipate her brigade would be too difficult to convince to take the trial, but that alone was not enough. She needed a way to redeem her reputation. A way to turn the tide, to catch up to… Her fingers clenched. Always behind, Nianzu had told her, slurring. You can’t fight fate, Song. No matter how we struggle, we’ll always end up behind. But what would he know?

“Should I follow you and disappear down a bottle, gege?” she bit out. “I won’t-”

It smelled burnt. Swallowing thickly, Song looked down and saw that in her fugue she had left the chicken unattended too long. The top was still pink, but when she flipped the cuts she saw they had charred stripes. The Tianxi swallowed. If she cut them out perhaps it wouldn’t show? No, they’ll still see I cut out parts. Perhaps if she sliced every piece in two, then – no, idiot, they would notice the quantity was too small. One of them would ask. They would know.

Hands shaking, tearing up like a fucking child, Song did the only rational thing she could: she put the pot off the fire, went outside with a shovel and dug a hole in a corner of the garden. She emptied the burnt chicken into it – she’d have to buy another to replace it from her own funds – and filled the hole. She had to hurry, they could be back anytime now. Song opened the windows to get rid of the smell and cleaned the iron pot before doing the recipe properly this time.

When her cabal began arriving one after the other, Song was ready. She welcomed them with a smile and a meal and her hand remained on the chisel as they all sat together and ate. Like a proper brigade, led by a proper captain.

“Would you mind if I closed the windows?” Angharad asked, polishing off the last of her rice. “It is getting rather chilly.”

Song’s hand twitched. The windows. Utter fool that she was, she had forgot to close the windows.

“I’ll do it,” she said, hurriedly rising to her feet.

Only she was sloppy in her haste, her knee caught the table and the shake tipped over a cup of water and – Abrascal caught it before it could spill. Her jaw clenched so tightly it hurt.

“Song,” Maryam slowly said, “are you-”

“Fine,” she bit out.

She strode to the windows and closed them abruptly. When she turned back towards the table it was to the sight of two concerned faces and Tristan Abrascal’s mask. And why wouldn’t they be concerned, when she was making a scene like a child throwing a tantrum? She forced herself to breathe out, smoothed out her tunic.

“My first covenant class did not go as I would have preferred,” Song said.

Some of the tension left the room. That was no achievement, when she had been the one to put it there.

“Mine either,” Maryam volunteered. “Our professor effectively washed his hands of me and I’ve been forced to make other arrangements.”

She made her way back to the table, carefully. As if her feet were made of porcelain.

“That is highly improper,” Angharad frowned, and Maryam tensed. “It is a professor’s duty to attend to all students as equally as they can.”

The Izvorica shot her a look and said nothing, which still a stark improvement over the entire last month. Song crossed her legs and sat on the floor again, back straight. She reached for her cup.

“I found a teacher and framed the Forty-Ninth’s patron for arson,” Abrascal casually said.

She choked on her mouthful of water, glaring at the thief since that timing had most definitely been deliberate. He smiled back innocently.

“Is that what Masks do?” Angharad hesitantly asked.

Meaning – is this otherwise dishonorable act permitted because it is your duty, and thus honorable in a different way? The Pereduri was not difficult to understand, once you grasped the tint of the spectacles she looked at the world through.

“You probably don’t want to ask too many questions about that,” Abrascal honestly replied. “Still, I can tell you I’ll be working at the Chimerical two afternoons a week. I’ll let you know the days as soon as I learn them.”

“My own afternoons will be filled four days out of five,” Angharad contributed. “Third day is to be a rest day.”

Maryam cleared her throat, earning glances.

“And how was your class?” she asked, sounding almost challenging.

“Six of us died,” Angharad replied.

Gods. The silence that put into place lasted until the plates and remains were taken away and Song brewed a pot of Someshwari tea. It was cheaper on Regnant Street than the Republican leaves, and with good reason – their tea was inferior in every way. Only Abrascal declined a cup. It was Song who broke the uncomfortable quiet.

“There is a price to the privileges of Stripe students,” she said.

She took out the trial bounty she had taken from the board, carefully folded, and set it down on the table. It made its way around, getting a raised eyebrow from Maryam and an interested look from Angharad. Abrascal was harder to read, but if she must she would peg him as thoughtful.

“It must be complete by next week or I will be sent away,” Song frankly told them. “Every Academy recommended is in the same situation.”

The only man among them snorted.

“Ouch, poor Forty-Ninth,” Abrascal said. “They’ll be stuck doing two.”

A fine argument for why few cabals would want two Stripes, and also for why no Academy recommended would want to command a cabal of leftovers. An incompetent brigade would not bring up your score high enough to pass by the year’s end, however eager they might be to obey you. Besides that, the way the thief had phrased his sentence was promising. It implied he was willing to participate, and Abrascal had been the most likely holdout in her mind.

“This is all we have to go on?” Maryam asked, staring at the paper.

She had been the last to receive it.

“It is.”

The Izvorica sighed, passing the bounty back to Song. She did not fold it again, and made a note to smoothen it out later tonight with weight pressing down on the sides.

“Well, I won’t turn away the coin,” Maryam said. “When did you have in mind?”

“Sixthday afternoon,” Song replied.

After the elective classes, though she would leave a wide margin of time to avoid possible inconveniences. She would have been more comfortable earlier in the week, but it was better to let her brigade settle in properly instead. They confirmed the split of coin and where in the city they would have to journey before they could be escorted to the trial – a place on the outskirts of Scholomance, which had them speculating the trial would be within the school.

The conversation soon trailed off. Maryam volunteered to wash the dishes, Angharad went out into the garden for her evening exercises – most nights she spent half an hour out there doing drills with her blade – but the surprise was when Tristan lingered at the table with her. Song had reason to remain, not being done with her tea, but he himself had none. Unless he wanted to speak with her, that was. The Tianxi cocked an eyebrow and waited.

“I need information,” the gray-eyed man said. “How can you see gods?”

Her heart clenched. She put down her cup of tea before it became visible there was a tremble to her fingers. Her hands went down onto her lap, hidden by the table.

“Pardon?” Song said.

“You can see contracts,” Abrascal elaborated. “But do you know of a way people could see gods?”

Not her, she realized with relief. He did not mean her. She kept her face smooth.

“I expect there are contracts out there that might allow this,” she said, mouth gone dry. “Why?”

He grimaced.

“All right, cards on the table,” he said. “Do you know of a way for devils to see gods?”

“Once annealed, devils become a fixed shape in the aether,” Song mused. “It may be that lets them sense gods, though outright sight seems a stretch.”

“Hage could see my patron god,” the thief flatly said. “Hear them, too.”

Song let out a low whistle. Her own god did not visit enough for this to be a risk, but it was useful to know.

“Thank you for the warning,” she said, inclining her head.

He hummed.

“Well, I suppose it’s not like I got nothing for it,” Abrascal said.

She sipped at her cup.

“No?”

“Hands are expressive,” he said. “Those with training, they often keep them out of sight when trying to hide something.”

As she had at the start of this conversation, damn her. Had she given herself away? The gray-eyed man studied her face, half-frowning.

“Well, there are things we don’t ask,” Tristan Abrascal said. “I’ll leave you to your tea, Song.”

He backed up from the table and rose to his feet even as her fingers clasped the side of the cup so hard her knuckles paled. He was not so smug as to wave her way before heading up the stairs, into that stargazing tower he had claimed as his bedroom, but it still felt like she had just been slapped in the face. Abrascal had no reason to keep her secrets. If he told the others… It could turn their entire year against her, the knowledge she could peer at their deepest secrets with nothing but a glance. Even those who cared nothing for the Dimming would-

“Easy now.”

Song sucked in a breath, finding there was hand on her shoulder. Maryam was half-kneeling at her side, arms wet with a sheen. She smelled like food scraps and wetness.

“Think of the sea,” the other woman said. “Tide comes in, tide goes out. Make yourself see it in your mind.”

She barely felt Maryam take the cup out of her hands and set it on the table, struggling to do ask asked.

“Match your breath to it,” the Izvorica murmured. “It comes in…”

Song breathed in.

“It goes out.”

By the time her heartbeat had settled, she did not dare to meet Maryam’s eyes.

“What did he say, Song?”

The tone was flinty.

“Little,” Song tiredly said. “It is-”

Staring down at the table, she sagged.

“I am, by score, now the last of the Stripe students,” she confessed. “I have failed you all.”

“I doubt that,” Maryam said, sitting down by her side. “What happened?”

The story tripped its way out of her, every word of it sounding like pathetic whining to her ears.

“That colonel sounds like a real bitch,” the Izvorica mused.

“Maryam,” Song hissed.

The pale-skinned girl shrugged.

“We agreed we’d be honest with each other, when we started this,” Maryam said. “So I’m being honest: that Cao woman sounds like a real bitch.”

“She’s a highly respected officer,” Song told her.

“Agree to disagree,” Maryam easily replied.

“The last time you used that sentence, you saddled our cabal with Tristan Abrascal,” Song muttered.

“And it’s been lovely having him,” she replied, then frowned. “Though he should have known better to prod you when you’re like this.”

Song straightened.

“I am not like anything,” she said.

Maryam said nothing, then sighed and passed a hand through her dark hair.

“The first I took a ship,” she said, “I wasn’t able to keep down a meal or sleep for three days straight.”

Song’s eyes snapped her way, the surprise plain on her face.

“They had to drug me,” the Izvorica said. “And I wasn’t much better when I woke from that. It took time before I learned I could close my eyes and not wake in chains, but before we docked I had learned. And no sailor on that ship ever mocked me for it.”

Maryam leaned in, squeezed her shoulder.

“Your ship is still out there on the black, Song,” she said. “But you’ll get there, I’m sure of it.”

She stayed there long after the Izvorica had left, until Angharad had returned from her exercises, sitting there along in the lamplight with a lick of cold tea at the bottom of her cup. Staring at the leaves mucking up at the bottom, the silver-eyed Tianxi wondered if this was how it had begun for her brothers.

And if one of her sisters would sit down, one day, and wonder if this was how it had begun for Song.

—

Their first class had taken place in an impressive lecture hall, but Saga took place in what could only be called a library.

The room was all tall stacks and chandeliers, filled with sets of tables fitting ten each. Only the library was near empty of books, with only a few stacks near the bottom filled with volumes. They were all copies of three books, which the professor insured were to be claimed once each per cabal. Professor Tenoch Sasan, still as disheveled as yesterday, had used much of the empty room to prop up large polished stone slates. After yesterday’s… eventfulness, Song found the professor’s assertion that his class would be more classical a relief.

“As a class, Saga will seem like the odd man out to many of you,” Professor Sasan said. “Compared to Warfare and Teratology, or even Mandate, I will concede that its direct use is less obvious.”

The man was a good speaker, Song thought. Engaging and easily heard.

“In practice, however, you will find that much of our work involved digging up the secrets of the past,” the professor said. “Vesper is riddled with the scars of old wars, with buried horrors and wonders. My charge in this class is not to teach a love of history – though if I can, I will – but to equip you to understand what you will encounter out in the world.”

He cleared his throat.

“You need to be able to tell Antediluvian ruins apart from those of the Second Empire,” Professor Sasan said. “To understand why Cathayan is spoken in some parts of the Someshwar, why realms bordering Izcalli share the same gods and customs while being estranged from the Grasshopper King’s rule.”

The professor grinned.

“You need to understand why Sacromonte remains one of the great powers of Vesper while commanding less than a tenth of the territory of even the smallest of its peer powers,” he said. “And while we can answer all these questions through the realities of the present, those answers will be incomplete – because the end of a trajectory cannot easily be understood without knowing its source.”

He marked the largest slate thrice.

“We look back, students, so that we might better understand what is ahead,” Professor Sasan said. “And despite the best efforts of time and men, there is much that was left behind for us to learn from.”

He opened his arms.

“Our history, as a rule, is divided into three periods. Who might give me the name of the very earliest?”

Tianxi history was divided into eleven periods so for once Song was entirely in the dark. Both Angharad and Abrascal were among those that raised their hand, however, and the latter was called on.

“Antiquity,” he said.

“Indeed,” Professor Sasan enthusiastically said. “As in all things historical naming an era is a contentious issue, but ‘Antiquity’ is the most common term used for the period beginning with the First Empire, the realm of the Antediluvians, and ending with Morn’s Arrival – that is, the wave of desperate refugees arriving in the wake of the First Empire’s destruction who founded Vesper as we know it.”

He filled in a line with the word Antiquity, then lowered his hand to the second.

“The second period is the Imperial Calendar,” the professor told them as he wrote the words, “so named for the way it broadly matches the span of the calendar used by the Lierganen Empire – though that calendar was, as we will cover, largely fantasy. It ends with the Second Empire itself. The most popular date used for this is the Thirteenth Betrayal. and as a scholar I must agree: it effectively ended Liergan as a state and unleashed the Succession Wars.”

The professor opened the question to the class again for the third period, and this time most raised their hand – Song included. It was an easy enough question, which a small Izcalli girl answered quietly enough she was twice asked to repeat.

“That is correct,” Professor Sasan said. “The third and most recent period is that of the Centennial Calendar, which began eight hundred and three years ago. Barring eventfulness, all of you will end your lives in the current century – that is, the Century of Smoke, which has only barely begun.”

After that opening the professor spent the better part of an hour getting the class to fill in the three periods with lesser stretches of times and great events – adding the Old Night, the Tumult, the Iscariot Accords – as he sorted through answers and explained what went on and what stayed off. As answers began to trail off, he eased them to the end of the exercise.

“While I would love to continue talking you ear off,” Professor Sasan said, “all of we general classes teachers are under instructions to give nothing more than a short introductory lecture this week – so that you might better settle into your covenant classes.”

He set down his chalk.

“Before dismissing you, however, I leave you with a thought and an assignment,” he continued. “History is partial, my students. It takes sides, damns and justifies, because we do and it us to who write it. Never confuse it for a cold science squabbling only with facts – and understand that the distinctions we draw within this discipline are not some ultimate truth but very much for our own won convenience.”

He gestured towards the great slate he had filled.

“Consider this,” Professor Sasan said. “These three periods of history, are they the sum whole of all that ever was in Vesper?”

A click of the tongue.

“Of course not,” he said. “This world existed before the Antediluvians came.”

Professor Sasan grinned.

“That is my assignment for you,” he said. “Crack open the books you’ve received and find me the answer to this question: what existed before the First Empire, and how do we call that distant era?”

—

After Professor Sasan’s jovial lecture, Song was not quite sure what to expect when the following morning saw the Thirteenth dragging themselves through the bowels of Scholomance to the buried crypt where they would be taught Teratology.

It had taken them a mere quarter hour to reach the Saga classroom once they’d entered Scholomance,, but this time it was easily twice as long to follow the spikes in the ground adorned with the yellow ribbons. Song watched the god of this place follow them from the corner of her eye as they passed through halls and hallways, a half-sunken chapel whose deep waters no one dared approach and finally circling stairway surrounded by a darkness that seemed to swallow all light.

“I will dare to hope Scholomance shuffles the journey to here next week,” Abrascal breathed out after they reached the bottom of the stairs. “That last part was unsettling.”

“I could do without the chimes in a wind that does not exist,” Maryam admitted.

“I am nearly certain I saw something moving under the water, back in that chapel,” Angharad grimaced.

“We are nearly there,” Song assured them.

The Teratology classroom, described to them as a crypt, lived up to the words. It was all arching stone and dim dampness, with lined up writing desks beneath oil lamps and walls covered with lemures stuffed or embalmed. Not only small ones, either, for a winged snake with exquisite rainbow-colored scales hung off the ceiling from one end of the room to another. The four of them claimed desks near the middle, where nothing loomed so close that Song would keeping looking back, and settled in. They were not the only ones unnerved by the journey to the classroom, or uneasily eyeing the jars and silhouettes on the walls. The crypt was more broad than long, and the front was a slightly raised stone dais where a desk had been placed. Their professor sat behind it.

He was a tall, slender man in his forties wearing an elaborate black tunic. Tianxi, his long black hair kept in an elaborate topknot held in place by a phoenix-shaped pin. Thin mustache and goatee were carefully styled, his eyes black as a beetle and almost as shiny. He watched the students enter impassively, sweeping to his feet only when the last had arrived.

“I am Professor Yun Kang, of the Peiling Society,” he announced, his voice smooth as velvet. “I will teach those of you capable the essentials of Teratology.”

Passing by his desk, he snatched a long baton of dark wood. It was polished enough to reflect lantern light.

“You will call me professor or sir,” Professor Kang informed them. “Anything else will see you ordered out of this room.”

He began striding across his low dais, forcing the students to follow him past pillars and the heads of their fellows.

“Teratology is the study of the monstrous,” he said. “That which has been changed by the touch of aether or Gloam, the lares and the lemures. It is the knowledge that will save your lives out in the dark, allow you to tell apart pithy and peril when encountered in service of the Watch.”

He scoffed.

“Scholars have dedicated their entire lives to Teratology and found this time to be all too short,” Professor Kang said. “My sole expectation of you as students is that most will learn the bare necessities and a handful of fortunate souls will rise to understand the sheer breadth of this discipline.”

The dark-haired man came to a stop.

“We have barely begun to plumb the depths of what exists beyond our small islands of Glare in this sea of darkness,” the professor said. “And the little we know shifts decade by decade, as the world does.”

Professor Kang strode across his stage, arms folded behind him.

“Teratology is an ever-changing field,” he lectured. “Not only must we follow the whims of nature and of the Ancients, but the foolishness of men can also change a land and fauna.”

The professor’s dark eyes swept through the desks, almost lazily. Song felt her stomach sink. There was something about that stare…

“Indeed, near the turn of the century an entire region that had been under regular Glare for centuries was condemned,” Professor Kang said. “Besides the colossal amount of death and ruin this caused, it is worth nothing that an entire scheme of fauna and flora was also irrevocably changed. Even should the Glare be returned, many of the changes will remain.”

He paused. Song swallowed.

“Can anyone name the region in question?”

A dozen hands went up, but Professor Kang did not so much as glance at them. Those dark eyes pinned her like a butterfly to a wall, and his lips quirked unpleasantly. A hand left his back and he pointed the baton directly at her.

“Captain Song Ren of the Thirteenth Brigade,” he said. “Answer the question.”

She breathed in.

“It is the Republic of Jigong,” Song replied with forced calm.

“Very good, very good,” he thinly smiled.

He turned away, making as if to stride across the stage again, but she knew better. A heartbeat later he had turned back towards her, tapping his baton against his chin pensively.

“Song, if you would,” Professor Kang idly said. “Would you happen to know what foolish, accursed family was responsible for the worst disaster Vesper has known since the peak of Succession Wars?”

She grit her teeth.

“The Ren family, sir,” she replied.

“Why, Song,” he said. “That happens to be your surname. Surely that is a coincidence.”

The silence in the hall was almost oppressive. Song sucked in a breath.

“Answer me, Ren,” Professor Kang coldly said. “Or walk out of this hall. I will not suffer disruptive students.”

“It is not a coincidence, sir,” she forced out.

“Ah, I do recall hearing something along those lines,” the dark-haired man idly said. “Your grandfather was the one responsible was he not? You are from the direct line of descent of the single worst traitor in the history of the Republics.”

She kept staring ahead.

“Ah,” he silkily said. “I understand. Such a famous girl, you must believe yourself above answering when your teacher addresses you.”

“I do not know what to say,” Song woodenly said.

“Understandable,” Professor Kang sighed. “I can only praise you for recognizing the utter worthlessness of any words you might utter.”

He tucked his hands behind him again.

“If you must inflict your presence on me, Ren, you will at least have the decency to never speak unless spoken to,” the professor said.

She swallowed.

“Yes, sir.”

He thinly smiled.

“I did not give you leave to speak,” he said. “This is your third and final warning.”

Humiliating as that had been, the stares that came after were worse. It felt like half the class was watching her face, some smirking and others contemptuous. The stares with pity in them burned the harshest.

“The teacher is in front,” Angharad coldly said when the student of her turned to her eye like an animal in a cage.

It shamed those closest to stop staring, but the attention only barely waned. And Professor Kang was watching it all from the front, just waiting for her to speak up and give him reason to cast her out. Once it became clear she would not give him the excuse, he chided her for distracting the class and announced that the entire first month of class would be dedicated to the study of what set apart lares and lemures from animals.

“Teratology is best understood not as a state or a catalogue but as a natural system,” Professor Kang said. “To best allow you to grasp this early in our time together, we will study a well-documented occurrence of such a system shifting.”

And as Song’s stomach sung, the professor went on to explain how for that entire first month they would study how the Dimming had changed the lands of Jigong, their fauna and flora and inhabitants. Every excruciating detail of the consequences of her grandfather’s sin, not only dragged out for everyone to see but studied and tested on. Only a hundred of the four hundred and three students of Scholomance were in this room, but she knew without a doubt that by the end of the day word would have spread through all Tolomontera. The Dimming and her family ties to it might as well been nailed to her forehead.

Captain Wen had warned her that one of the teachers had it out for her, had he not?

Well, Song had found him.

# Chapter 19

Tristan had never been the sort to find mindless labor soothing. He had seen too many people break their bodies stacking stones and scraping canals to believe there was anything noble about work, no matter the talk about the dignity in sweating for one’s wage.

Horses were patted and fed carrots, but when they got old they were still made into glue.

Still, the thief was not afraid of work when it had good reasons and there were plenty to weed the garden. For one he had seen Song laying out the beginnings of a chore sheet, so it would be best to get ahead of the tide and position himself as the designated gardener to avoid being volunteered for something worse.

The sheer quantity of soap the Tianxi had bought promised an unfortunate amount of mopping lay in someone’s near future.

“Oh, this one’s red,” Fortuna enthusiastically said. “Do you think it’s poisonous?”

Tristan eyed the weed in question, whose stem was pinkish and bore oval red leaves covered with thin white strands that were somewhat hair-like. It was not even the most suspicious plant he’d come across in the remains Sakkas’ ancient garden, which had him glad he had bought leather gloves.

“If this is the prelude to the usual suggestion I try to make tea out of it, I refuse,” he told the goddess.

“Coward,” the Lady of Long Odds accused, slumping down by his side.

Her red dress impossibly fluttered as she sat, her fingers sweeping back her golden hair to expose the choker on her neck – a riot of rubies and pearls he could only grieve not being able to pawn in the material. Eyes on the weed, Tristan carefully caught it and ripped it out with an eye to getting all the roots. Once satisfied he had, he tossed it onto the pile behind him.

“You don’t listen to me anymore,” Fortuna continued, tone growing whining.

“I’ve never listened to you,” Tristan absent-mindedly replied, ripping out another weed.

“You could let me test Song, at least,” she pressed. “You know you’d planned to, before Maryam chewed you-”

His gloved hand ceased short of another weed as he turned to glare at her, which only had her grinning.

“We had a disagreement, that’s all,” Tristan said.

Fortuna answered with a strange, poorly executed gesture that only the accompanying sound of ‘wu-paah’ let him understand was meant to be a whip being cracked.

“Come on,” the goddesses wheedled. “It doesn’t have to be in the middle of dinner, I can wait until it’s just the three of us in the room and make like I’m punching her in the-”

He ripped out the weed and threw it at her face, sailing right through.

“Rude,” Fortuna glared.

“We will test her, that hasn’t changed,” Tristan said. “But she gets a few more days of reprieve.”

The goddess, already grinning again, opened her mouth but he raised a hand to silence her preemptively.

“And no, Maryam is not why,” the thief said, then frowned. “Also that’s not what a whip sounds like, you’re doing it wrong.”

Fortuna spluttered in genuine offense, beginning a diatribe about how she’d once had whips of pure gold dedicated to her honor and no one in Vesper better knew what the crack of a whip might sound like. He rolled his eyes and returned to weeding.

Getting cornered by Maryam had not been pleasant, and there was perhaps some truth to her claim he had pushed too far with Song, but Tristan had not been convinced then and he was not now. A reminder that if Song turned on him he had the means to ruin her was not a threat, it was evening the score. Considering how rattled she had been that night he could have gotten much more out of her, so as far as he was concerned he had shown a great deal of restraint.

Maryam was evidently of a different opinion – ‘kicking her when she’s down’ had come up a few times – but he had given ground largely to end the conversation. Which she had caught on to, and been twice as angry about, but truth be told nothing she had said since moved the needle. Song Ren was not his friend, she was someone Tristan occasionally traded with. To keep the Thirteenth functional he was willing to throw her the occasional bone but he owed her nothing.

That Maryam evidently did count her a friend would weigh on the scales going forward, but that was all.

“I don’t understand why I should wait,” Fortuna pouted. “You want confirmation she really sees me, and since you insist your lady friend is not enough to stop then there should be nothing holding us back.”

Tristan sighed. He had been going to wait only a day or two, originally, so she was not being a pest entirely without reason.

“Teratology, this morning,” he said.

“The man with the skinny mustache who likes to hear himself talk,” Fortuna said, then cocked her head to the side. “Oh, he did pick on her some I suppose. Why do we care?”

Sometimes it was easy to forget that the Lady of Long Odds was not human, for all that she wore one’s guise. ‘Pick on her some’ was an interesting way to describe the public humiliation of Song Ren before a hundred of her peers, neatly destroying her reputation and marking her as poison to the touch for everyone in the room – and then most of Scholomance by day’s end, no doubt. Professor Yun Kang had known precisely what he was doing with that speech.

But Fortuna was a goddess, so neither humiliation nor being made a pariah weighed all that much on the scales of her mind. She would not be harmed by such a thing, so she could not truly see it as the attack it was.

“About Song? We don’t,” he replied.

Fortuna frowned.

“Then why?”

“Because we do not,” Tristan evenly said, “side with landlords.”

And that was what Professor Kang was, when you stripped him of the black cloak and title. Just another petty king sitting atop his land and rationing your right to have a roof above your head. A landlord of knowledge instead of houses, this one, but Tristan well knew the likes of that tone and that little smile. Yun Kang was the worst of the breed, those that promised they would delay your rent if you sold out the other tenants. No, you never sided with the landlord even when it cost you to hold back.

It was only a matter of time until it was you they came to bleed dry: there could be no peace with a leech, only truce until it grew hungry again.

Professor Kang had marked Song publicly in the hopes that the rest of them would turn on her, and no doubt he would toss little favors to those that went out of their way to trip her. But Tristan knew that game and he would have no fucking part of it, so Song Ren had from him a reprieve – she would be tested only when she had found her footing again, because he refused to let his own actions help the plans of the likes that man.

“So we dislike the professor more, that’s fair,” Fortuna mused. “I could punch him instead, if you’d like.”

He glanced at her, brow rising.

“What is it with you and throwing hands lately?”

“You said I can’t take revenge on Hage,” she said.

“I told you to apologize to Hage,” Tristan corrected.

She dismissed his words with a wave, then made a moue.

“And I have been feeling restless,” the Lady of Long Odds admitted. “Something about the air here is invigorating.”

Fortuna with greater vigor? Now there was the stuff of nightmares. She was pest enough while lazy.

“Is it because Tolomontera is an aether well?” he ventured.

Gods were like fish swimming in the aether, so perhaps the metaphorical change of water had been good for her.

“Maybe,” Fortuna muttered.

Much as he would have been inclined to keep pursuing that, the goddess rose to her feet in an indication she was so disinclined. Best not to push, he decided, or she’d get contrary about that subject in the future. Instead Tristan returned to the business of weeding until he had finished the whole rectangular field he had earlier outlined. It would take days more to clean up the full garden, at this rate, but he would begin sowing before that. They had already bought seeds with brigade funds and he was itching to use them.

It was a few trips moving the piled of ripped weeds to a corner of the garden where he would let them dry for a day before burning them, careful never to let anything touch his bare skin. He doubted that any plant that’d so long survived near the cottage of an archbishop of the Sunless House was entirely harmless.

Though he was done with the work he’d decided on for the day, the thief elected to scope out the boundaries of the garden one more time. Tredegar clearly intended on using some of the space for her exercises, which he supposed was fair enough, and he suspected that soon there would be a push for a shooting range as well. Best to delineate those areas now so the arrangements were not haphazard later. He had already put numbers to the dimensions with a measuring rope, but accounting for where the bushes and the-

“Huh,” Tristan said, stopping.

Fortuna leaned over his shoulder.

“You didn’t dig that, did you?” she asked.

“No,” he said. “I did not.”

So why was there recently dug earth in a corner of the garden, tucked away behind bushes? He was curious enough to go fetch the shovel and find out. He found nothing, and begun to think someone had dug as simple exercise – sounded like something Tredegar might get up to – until around a foot and a half deep he hit something solid. He loosened the earth around it then finished digging up by hand, revealing what appeared to be… stripes of chicken starting to rot. Frowning, Tristan examined the pieces and found some of them were lightly charred on the bottom.

Who had cooked these was not in question, but why she would have buried them was.

“Bait for animals?” Fortuna suggested.

No, they did not seem to find their way through the protections Sakkas had left. Tristan had not seen so much as a rat around, though there were insects so the filtering was demonstrably not universal. He put the stripe back into the hole.

“We wait until next week to test Song,” he finally said.

“Come on! If anything, ruining a chicken should lose her a day,” Fortuna protested.

“Only an idiot jostles for position with someone standing on the edge of a cliff,” the thief grunted back. “Maryam was right.”

Not for the reasons she had given him, but merit where it was due. He reburied the chicken and smoothed out the ground before scattering some twigs and dead leaves atop it. Tucking his gloves into his belt after he was done, he stretched out and sighed. Enough work for the day. He put away the shovel and went around the increasingly visible garden path to head back inside, finding that another had arrived while he was distracted.

Angharad Tredegar was seated at the low table by the windows, uniform loosened and a cup of wine in hand. They’d bought and brought new chairs yesterday so she could have sat at the kitchen table instead of on the ground in the drawing room, but he supposed the view was nicer where she sat. They were still missing furniture around the low table, though. Tristan had been disappointed to find out that the very comfortable armchairs he’d sat on in the Witching Hour were rotten through, though there would not have been enough for all of them anyhow.

“Evening, Tristan,” Tredegar said, turning to face him, and he froze.

The dark-skinned woman had what appeared to be a swelling black eye on the right and some bruising on the opposite cheek. Gods, what had she been attacked by to actually be hit – Lucifer’s own retinue? Only she seemed in a fine mood, not fuming, so she must not see herself as being defeated.

“Evening,” he slowly replied, then cocked an eyebrow. “Did you get that cleaned up properly?”

“Water is enough for bruises,” she began, “surely-”

He sighed and went to fetch the physician’s kit he had acquired from the Watch depot for a desultory sum – though the officers there had noted his name and brigade, so he could not buy them by the dozen and sell them to others at a markup. He touched a soft rag with alcohol and sat down by her side, gesturing for her to face him properly. Though Tredegar seemed faintly embarrassed and muttered something about fussing, she let him clean her face. Some of the cheek bruises had broken skin so the touch of the rag must have stung, but her face did not even twitch.

“What happened?” he asked. “I was under the impression you did not have Skiritai class today.”

“It was not obligatory,” Tredegar said. “The Marshal arranged rounds of sparring with each other to assess of our capacity with steel, powder and fists so we might best pick our companions for the fight on fifthday.”

Tristan’s expectations of what might be asked of Skiritai students had been high, but somehow he still had been surprised that ‘open a mystery box full of maneating monster’ had turned out to be their introductory lecture and the marginally improved situation of being allowed to pick the next enemy with foreknowledge was going to be a weekly occurrence. He cocked an eyebrow at her.

“I take it the fisticuffs turned on you?” Tristan asked.

The noblewoman grimaced.

“Muchen He is a devil up close, which I should have inferred when he sought me out for the fight,” she said. “Mind you, I trounced him with a blade. He pulls left and his footing is weak on the retreat.”

“Did you get him to use his contract?” he curiously asked.

Simultaneously he made to clean an already clean cheek as a distraction while his hand subtly crept towards the side of her coat. It should still be in the pocket.

“Marshal de la Teverin forbade their use,” Tredegar informed him. “He insists that-”

He barely felt her fingers catch his wrist before she slammed it into the table. He yelped, snatching back his hand when she released it, and sighed as he stopped falsely cleaning her cheek.

“What gave it away this time?” he asked.

The noblewoman smugly smiled.

“You always try with your right hand,” she said. “I have begun keeping track of when you obscure my line of sight with your left.”

He hummed. That was a bad habit, he would need to work on it. Tredegar’s own hand went into her pocket, producing the iron coin with a copper border he had been trying to steal.

“Do you need it back?” she asked.

He shook his head.

“Keep it,” Tristan said. “I need to keep practicing. Hage says that in two weeks regardless of my progress he will have me begin to practice the opposite.”

“Planting coins?” Tredegar asked, amused. “How charitable.”

Best that she did not consider what else he would be able to plant, once he knew the tricks. Still, it was somewhat amusing to him that in Sacromonte he had considered himself too fine a thief to practice something as risky as pickpocketing but that as a Mask he was being trained in it.

“Thanks for the help,” he honestly said. “Maryam never notices, so it is little help.”

And Song had declined to participate, which he was starting to believe might be for the best.

“It helps keep me on my toes,” Tredegar happily said. “It is good training for me as well.”

Tristan rose to his feet, putting away his physician’s kit, and stretched out one last time. In other circumstances he might have been tempted to take a nap before getting started on the readings assigned by Professor Sasan, but he found his gaze straying to garden.

“I will be cooking tonight,” he decided.

Tredegar perked up, interested.

“Oh?”

“Something my mother taught me,” Tristan said, rolling his shoulder. “Sopa de colcha.”

“Quilt soup,” the Pereduri translated. “A strange name. What is it made of?”

“Whatever’s left,” he drily replied. “Come on, you can help me make it.”

Her main contribution ended up fetching water from the well, but at least she tried.

—

Considering how often Tristan had to go digging for secrets, it was a pleasant turn when answers were dropped right onto his lap.

He had expected Theology class to be of only accessory use to him, and little of what he first saw disabused him of the notion. They sat in the same hall used for Mandate, even settling at the same table – Song had sat there, and since yesterday everyone was treating her like glass even though she remained outwardly calm no one dared suggest another spot. This time the professor began at precisely the announced time rather than studying them through the eyehole as Professor Iyengar had. Professor Malba Artigas was tall, fair-haired and prone to frowning rather ferociously at the smallest of distractions. The thief was also fairly certain she was corregida – that is, a woman once believed a man.

Professor Artigas introduced herself as a signifier from the Akelarre Guild, speaking naught else of her qualifications or even her rank, and when a student muttered something in the back of the class she traced a Sign and swelled his tongue to the size of a sausage for half an hour. It hung out of his mouth, tar-black like some sort of leathery slug..

No one dared to chatter after that.

Her way of lecturing had more in common with Professor Kang than Professor Iyengar, only rarely calling on answers from the class and expecting copious notes to be taken. She laid out the nature of what would be studied in the first year – essential metaphysical forces, divinity and the infernal, the boundaries of contracts and Signs – only to then suddenly earn Tristan’s full attention.

“The introductory concept I wish you to leave this class with today is one of the foundations of Theology, the ‘Necalli scale of orders’,” Professor Artigas said. “It is also called the ‘order of entities’ by some, after its most common use.”

Tristan, who had only recently read that Fortuna was determined not to be a ‘second-order entity’, leaned in eagerly. There were faint murmurs in the back of the hall, but this time the professor did not raise her hand to punish the guilty.

“For those among you not on the Savant track, surprise at hearing the name Necalli spoken without a following curse is understandable,” the professor conceded. “To those yet in the dark, Necalli Suchil was a great border lord who reigned in the northeast of Izcalli in the years during and after the unification of that kingdom.”

Oh Manes. Bad took on a different depth of meaning when paired with the mention of an Izcalli noble with troops near a border. Professor Artigas folded her arms.

“Necalli was deeply concerned with the decay and destruction of Glare devices in the region, to the extent that he elected surrender to the House of Toxtle as a vassal rather than warring to remain a king,” she said. “He then spent the better part of thirty years and a massive fortune studying the deepest mysteries of Gloam, Glare and aether on an unprecedented scale.”

That did not sound too bad, but the faint grimace on the blond woman’s face told him otherwise.

“In that process, Necalli is believed to have enslaved, murdered and tortured somewhere in the vicinity of sixteen thousand souls,” Professor Artigas said.

And there it was.

“Yet, unpleasant as that reality is, Necalli Suchil is the father of the modern discipline of Theology,” Professor Artigas continued. “His writings are foundational and his great work, the scale of orders, has become the scholarly consensus.”

A look around the lecture hall revealed dark looks by the dozen – Someshwari and Izcalli both. The Kingdom of Izcalli had been unified in what, the Century of Loss? The man must have been despised beyond rival, for his name to still cast such a cloud after five hundred years.

“Necalli’s first contribution to the discipline is the principle of occupancy, which is as follows: the same discrete quantity of aether cannot hold two affects simultaneously, while remaining susceptible to pressures of mass.”

Professor Artigas took the time to write it out on the slate, her looped handwriting ornate but easy enough to read.

“In simplified terms, the same aether tainted by a man’s anger cannot also be tainted by someone else’s sadness, but an entire city grieving will push out a single mother’s rage. Since a god in their incipient state is essentially an aggregate of tainted aether, this means that gods cannot ‘overlap’.”

She turned a steady look onto the class.

“That is the reason why, for example, there are thousands of regional war gods instead of a single such entity for all of Vesper.”

Tristan cocked his head to the side, only barely following. So gods were like petty kings out in the Murk, each collecting from a handful of streets and kicking each other in the knees so none could ever get on top and collect from too large a territory. Greater gods like the Manes would be the equivalent of the large coteries, then, who had carved out a larger slice of the city and gathered enough roughs that no one could edge them out anymore.

“Having proved the principle of occupancy through his experiments, Necalli then went on to create his scale orders: it is a measure of the conceptual ‘space’ an entity occupies in the aether simply by existing.”

So a rating of coterie sizes, Tristan mused. How large a territory they would be able to claim. The professor drew a six on the slate.

“Animals,” Professor Artigas said, “are sixth-order entities. This is the lowest order and means that their trail in the aether it the smallest of all living beings. Their emotions, limited as they are, cause such little emanation in the aether that until late in the Second Empire they were believed to have none.”

Above the six she traced a five.

“Humans are fifth-order entities,” the professor said.  “A single’s soul emanations are measurable but not mathematically significant. The overwhelming majority of beings in Vesper are fifth-order entities, however, so by sheer dint of numbers this order has the most significant influence on the aether.”

A four followed.

“Fourth-order entities are the least of the beings we call gods – that is to say, aether intellects that fed on a particular spectrum of aether taint until they became defined by it, forming into a continuous entity.”

The professor traced a long line, as if to separate the orders that would follow from the rest, then drew the three.

“Third-order entities are what we call ‘manifested’ gods,” Professor Artigas said. “Gods that took a physical form. This order of entities contains the most degrees of variation of any on the scale, the weakest in it being prone to overpowering by fourth-order entities while the greatest can be an object of worship across entire nations – the Moon-Eater of Izcalli and the Thousand Eye Lord of the Someshwar come to mind. Third-order entities have stabilized their existence and barring harm done unto them will continue to exist forever.”

She turned a steady look on them.

“This is not necessarily a blessing,” Professor Artigas said. “A god that manifested in the material but had its ‘space’ in the aether squeezed out by other entities will enter what we call rampancy: loss of intellect combined with an existential need to create masses of aether taint it can feed on to reclaim its space.”

That didn’t make sense, Tristan thought. Fortuna was weak enough she could not even dislocate, so how could she be of an order that stood above that of manifested gods? Why would the Watch even think that possible?

“Second-order entities are the highest ever recorded,” the professor continued, marking the number. “These are gods not only manifested but which have become such integral part of a concept they are fed by its mere continued existence in human consciousness.”

Now he rubbed the bridge of his nose, idly glancing around. Fortuna did not appear to be there – she usually wasn’t, during classes – so hopefully she had not heard that. The last thing he needed was for her to get delusions of grandeur about her being the incarnation of luck or somesuch nonsense.

“Standing in the presence of such an entity will kill most humans, as they are so large and solid within the aether that they are nearly impossible to dislodge by other pressures,” Professor Artigas mildly said. “Your soul, unable to emanate your emotions into the aether, will swell like an overfilled wineskin until it pops.”

Tristan grimaced at that, and he was not the only one. The professor brushed back a strand of hair escaped from her elaborate hairdo – curled, twisted and pinned up – and smiled for the first time since she had entered the hall.

“The only known way around this difficulty is to expose individuals of an age to have begun but not finished coalescing their soul to high-density aether,” she said. “For a period of time of several years would be best, over time allowing the soul to become… elastic, for lack of a better term.”

None in the hall were fool enough, Tristan thought, to be unaware that Tolomontera sat on one of the largest aether wells in Vesper. Or to miss what the professor was hinting at.

“It would not create immunity to the effect, unfortunately, but it would allow such individuals to stand in the presence of such a god without simply metaphysically suffocating to death,” Professor Artigas said, and then smile was gone.

The last number, one, was drawn almost as an afterthought.

“First-order entities are entirely theoretical, but they are the logical conclusion of the Necalli scale of orders,” she told them. “Such a being’s will would be absolute within the aether, and through conceptual symmetry it would be able to shape reality with but a thought.”

She shrugged.

“The Sleeping God, should he exist, would be such an entity.”

The lecture did not continue for long after that, and Tristan was only half-listening anyhow. What was it about Fortuna that had led the Watch to even consider she might be so high in the scale of orders?

And why was it that the more he learned, the more answers turned to questions in his grasp?

—

Warfare boasted two teachers and a horde of assistants.

The pair introduced themselves as Captain Rhys and Captain Nandi. The former was a Stripe, the latter Skiritai, and they shared the surname of Khota. Married, he decided after watching them a bit. Rhys sounded Pereduri – name as much as accent, which had much in common with Tredegar’s – while Captain Nandi was markedly darker of skin as well as near a foot taller. Captain Rhys was handsome enough he got admiring looks, two golden studs in his lip moving every time he smiled, while his wife had so many scars Tristan would believe it if told she’d fallen into a pile of razor blades face first.

The day’s class was to take place on a drilling field tucked away between two wings of Scholomance, only a short walk away from the plaza outside. The spikes hammered into the ground were much rarer, with longer distances between them, but the walk there was no more pleasant for not being inside the halls of the school. Silhouettes seemed to be following them from rooftops, shadows hid pits and unsettling windows. The students had moved as a group without someone stepping up to propose it, dim unease making them close ranks.

The pair of captains was not alone on the field, either, with a small horde of officers around them. Captain Rhys explained that Warfare was to alternate between individual practices led by Captain Nandi  and the cabal-based tactics studies which were his half of the class. His wife kept picking up his sentences where he trailed off and the other way around, which Tristan found annoying but many around him seemed to find charming. What the Malani explained was that, more than any other of the general classes, Warfare was to be loosely evaluated.

Unlike Professor Kang’s promise of a test every two weeks at the minimum, neither of the captains intended on following their students all that closely.

“Basic marksmanship with a firearm of your choice and an acceptable standard of armed or unarmed close combat will be all that is required of you to pass to the second year,” Captain Nandi said. “I expect at least many of you would be capable of passing that evaluation today.”

“There will be a test at the end of the year, both written and field, for the tactical half of the class,” Captain Rhys said. “That is all.”

“Warfare exists for two reasons,” his wife continued. “The first is to bring the recommended from non-combat covenants to an acceptable field standard.”

A fair concern, Tristan mused, if they were to be sent out on assignments where all cabalists might be drawn into the fighting. The Watch was not going to pour years and a fortune into training a Tinker just so they could be eaten by the first lemure to sneak into camp at night.

“The second,” her husband said, “is for those of you who want to sharpen your skills to have the opportunity to do so. You will get from this class what you put in, nothing more or less.”

“It is your right to coast through,” Captain Nandi acknowledged. “Some of you will.”

“And among those, some will live to regret it – if they live at all,” Captain Rhys bluntly said. “The Old Night does not care what covenant you belong to.”

And on that charming note, they laid out how the class was to take place. The drilling field was to be split into three thirds: one for firearms, one for armed combat and one for hand-to-hand. Students were invited to head where they would prefer, and could even move from one group to another during the class as they wished. The captains and the other blackcloaks on the field were to serve as instructors for one of the subjects, with the emphasis on the first day being evaluating if a student was currently capable of passing Captain Nandi’s end-of-the-year evaluation.

The mass of students exploded into chatter at the announcement, cabals pulling together to discuss. The Thirteenth was no exception.

“I will be heading to the armed combat,” Tredegar immediately volunteered.

“Aren’t the only ones likely to give you a challenge Skiritai?” Tristan noted. “You already train with those.”

“Captain Nandi moves likes a swordmistress,” the noblewoman said, eyes bright. “I would test myself against her.”

“The firearms for me,” Maryam contributed. “I would find out if I am fine enough a shot with a pistol already.”

He slid a glance at Song, expecting to hear the same. She must have caught his unspoken meaning, because she shook her head.

“I would not learn anything,” she said, which should have sounded like a boast.

It did not.

“Armed for me as well,” the Tianxi said. “I could use the practice.”

Eyes went to him, as the last holdout, and he grimaced.

“Hand-to-hand,” Tristan said.

He was tempted to find out if someone could teach him the knife – close up and thrown – but weapons could be taken from you. Your hands could not.

Well, not without a hatchet and some effort but if it came to that he’d have more pressing worries.

“Wise,” Maryam praised. “They won’t let you throw the pistol here, and that’s your best shot with one.”

He glared at her. Mostly true, but still.

“Unarmed is a fine choice,” Tredegar praised. “We could practice at the cottage on evenings!”

“Let’s see how bad my bruises are first,” the thief snorted.

“Remember not to take risks that will see you wounded,” Song reminded them. “Tomorrow afternoon we are to undertake the bounty.”

A round of agreements and they parted ways, breaking up as most of the other cabals were. The subject Tristan had picked turned out to be the least popular, so comparatively the twenty or so headed the same way as him should benefit from more attention by the instructors. Only the thief found himself getting a little too much attention when one of the instructors picked him out from the pack immediately.

“This one does not even know the basics,” Sergeant Mandisa said. “I’ll put him through a remedial.”

“Surely that’s not-” he began.

She dragged him off by the scruff of the neck, other instructors answering his pleading stare by pointedly looking away. He could not even be angry at them for it: Mandisa was terrifying. She released him only when they reached a circle of white paint in the sand, and none too gently.

“A pleasure to meet you again, sergeant,” he charmingly smiled. “Why-”

The slap on his right cheek wasn’t hard. It didn’t even hurt, really, the sting was mostly from surprise. He had barely seen her move.

“You little rat,” Mandisa smiled. “Did you really think Wen wouldn’t notice you went through his things?”

Ah, unfortunate. It would have been nice to get away with it.

“It was the assignment,” he said, which was largely true.

“You entered my home,” she coldly said. “My room was unlocked, m underclothes in the open.”

Tristan eyed her with open confusion at the odd turn.

“What would poisoning you gain me?” he asked.

More confusing still was how baffled she looked at his answer. He wasn’t the one implying the use of a probably expensive contact poison on underclothes to rid himself of a Watch officer who’d yet to even act against him.

“Pois- what are you even saying?” she said. “I mean stealing them.”

He cocked his head to the side, studying the madwoman.

“For burning?” Tristan asked.

Surely they couldn’t be that expensive. No, by the look of her face he’d missed his shot in the dark.

“Ah, of course, for washing,” he tried, injecting confidence he did not feel.

Although why she would be angry at him doing a choice for her he could not say. The sergeant stared at him for a long, unblinking moment before sighing. He had… passed a test, maybe? Or perhaps been disqualified, it was hard to tell.

“All right,” Mandisa said. “I won’t be breaking your nose purposefully.”

“I think you mean accidentally,” Tristan said.

“There was not,” she beamed, “going to be anythingaccidental about it, I assure you.”

“I don’t suppose I could have another instructor,” he tried.

“I’m a qualified hand-to-hand instructor who places well in tournaments,” Sergeant Mandisa said. “You have the best possible instructor already, Tristan.”

He sighed.

“Try not to give me another black eye,” he asked. “The last one is just starting to get better.”

“Sure,” Mandisa lied.

—

He was not qualified in hand-to-hand or with a pistol. It was going to be a long year.

# Chapter 20

Tredegar was out in the garden, swinging her saber at the air. Presumably she was winning.

Maryam watched her through the window, having dragged a chair from the kitchen table to sit there while eating her meal and waiting for Song to return. Tristan, leaning against the windowsill, was eyeing the exercise with polite disinterest as he went through the last of the bread.

“It was mostly mathematics and memorizing star charts,” Maryam said. “We haven’t so much as glanced at a ship yet. You?”

The Sacromontan tore a piece from the loaf and popped it into his mouth, scarfing it down like a starving man. The meals of Scholomance were filling in his cheeks, smoothing away some of the lean in him. Maryam had thought him handsomer before, but this was certainly better for him.

“Professor Xiomara started us out dissecting green plague corpses,” he said.

Her head whipped his way in surprise.

“Weeding out the faint-hearted, I think,” Tristan mused. “We were thirty-two when class started but getting elbow deep in guts and pus probably ran out a third of that number.”

Maryam eyed him uneasily.

“You washed after, right?”

He blinked.

“I wiped my hands,” he said, like that was good enough.

A moment passed as she searched the thief’s face, which was just a tad too bemused. The tension left her shoulders.

“I almost bought that,” Maryam admitted.

The gray-eyed man cackled.

“We all wore gloves and overclothes during and we still scrubbed before leaving,” Tristan told her. “Mind you, the professor says the green plague isn’t contagious when the corpse is older than a day.”

Between the monsters that Tredegar was fighting underground and the plague corpses, Maryam was developing a degree of pity for the captains in charge of supplying Port Allazei.

“The worst Professor Sibiya sprung on us was language requirements,” she offered. “Fluent Antigua and enough Umoya to get by.”

Maryam had been ready to dislike the Malani professor for it but his reasons were unfortunately sensible. The Kingdom of Malan’s explorers had named most of the moons and constellations in the deep Aeolian Ocean and they had the only reliable charts leading through it to the western lands. Some degree of capacity with the language was needed if one was to ever sail beyond the Five Seas.

“You know Umoya?” Tristan asked, sounding surprised.

Maryam mutely nodded. Her father had insisted and Mother thought it a sound notion as well – if for different reasons. She was hardly fluent and had been told her accent was thick, but she understood the language well enough.

“Some Centzon as well,” she said. “My mentor is Izcalli.”

“Even Tredegar is fluent in two languages,” he muttered. “I might need to expand my horizons.”

Neither of them bothered to mention Song, whose arsenal of languages was simply not worth comparing to. And speaking of that particular devil, before Tristan could finish devouring the loaf the Tianxi swept in through the front door – putting away her clothes and weapons so habitually she did not even need to look at what she was doing while doing it. Tristan moved to stand by the Izvorica as silver eyes glanced their way. Their captain sighed.

“Why are you still pickpocketing Maryam?” Song asked. “It hardly serves as training.”

Maryam turned to glare at the thief, who smiled innocently. He offered back the bronze-rimmed coin he’d taken, and also two silvers. He cocked an inquisitive eyebrow.

“I thought more coins would make it harder to steal,” Maryam said. “On account of them tinkling together, I mean.”

“You would need more,” he informed her. “And I’d still be able to skim from the top with little noise.”

The smug bastard. She might have put a mouse trap in that pocket to wipe the look off his face, if not for the real chance she might forget it was in there and snap her own fingers instead. Pointedly turning away from the gray-eyed man, she smiled at Song.

“How was your class?” she asked.

“Interesting,” Song replied. “The first two months are to be spent studying the composition and doctrine of the armies of the great powers before we move on to the strategic aspects of the class.”

That sounded horribly dull, but Song’s aim was to rise up the ranks of the Watch so that sort of thing seemed right up her alley.

“I am glad you are enjoying it,” she diplomatically said. “Tristan and I already ate, but I am not so sure about Tredegar.”

Song nodded.

“I will call her in, then, and we can sit together before we go.”

It was a short enough meal that Maryam did not have time to be irritated by the company, so it was in a decent mood they all departed for Scholomance.

—

This whole thing stank, Tristan thought.

The Trial of Contest had smacked of bad news since the start, but the moment they were greeted at the plaza outside Scholomance not by some bored sergeant but Professor Tenoch Sasan the thief knew this was going to be more trouble than it was worth. Sure, there were three more soldiers present but that their Saga teacher had decided to use the second half of his sixthday to accompany them was a warning sign. It was, unfortunately, too late to retreat.

“We are still waiting on another,” Professor Sasan informed them. “It should not be long.”

His eyes were on the bridge behind them, which Tristan found interesting. That meant coming through the ruins, with all the dangers implied – the lemures were learning not to attack near the main avenue, but everywhere else was still hunting ground – yet the way the Izcalli had phrased it there would be only one more added to their party. The four of them stood there with the blackcloaks, shuffling awkwardly while armed to the teeth in their fighting fit, until the promised silhouette appeared.

A Tianxi, Tristan saw, and wearing those loose black robes that Navigators seemed to be able to use as a uniform. Long black hair kept in a braid and burn scars on the side of her face, which were not so half as interesting as the way Maryam stiffened at the sight of her. He leaned in.

“Familiar?” he murmured.

She nodded, then raised the pitch of her voice so all would hear.

“That is Captain Yue,” Maryam said. “She is the senior Akelarre on Tolomontera and head of the local chapterhouse.”

As well as the officer who’d taken his blue-eyed friend under her wing after her teacher washed his hands of her. Only Maryam had seemed more worried than happy about that, which was telling. Looking up the woman was on his list, though his inquiries to Hage had only yielded that the Navigators were a viciously private lot and he should tread lightly. Captain Yue seemed in a fine mood and greeted them happily, trading a few quips with Professor Sasan – they appeared acquainted – before straightening her collar.

“Shall we get a move on?” Captain Yue asked. “The Lugar Vacio is not easy for the school to move, but it has done it before.”

Song cleared her throat.

“May I ask what-”

“Where your trial will take place,” the other Tianxi interrupted. “Get your feet moving, Thirteenth. You are the first takers of the year so you have my curiosity, but I do have other plans this afternoon.”

Song had that look on her face that she always put there when she felt like she had been slapped but didn’t want to show it. Tristan instead kept his eye on Captain Yue, and found she was not acting like a Kang – she was not paying Song enough attention to be out to get her.

She merely had poor manners.

There was no arguing with that order, however, so het moving they did. Tristan had a scheme to obtain more information, naturally, which relied on the way that he had never met a single scholar of history that did not enjoy expounding about it at great length when asked. As they passed through the open doors of Scholomance, walking grounds covered with stained glass light, the thief slid into place by Professor Sasan’s side. The brown-eyed man shot him an amused look.

“So here comes the Mask, hungry to get the inside track,” the professor said. “You could set a clock by the skulking.”

Ah. The man was an old friend of Wen’s, so perhaps Tristan should have been more careful in his approach. He’d been caught out in his intentions but retreat would help none, so he was left with audacity instead.

“It’s the stubble, sir,” he said, smiling brightly. “It makes you look gullible.”

Professor Sasan choked, letting out a burst of laughter that startled the rest of the group. He could feel Song’s stare on his back, weighing whether or not it wanted to be a glare.

“Thank you for the advice, soldier,” the professor said, lips still twitching. “Ask your questions before my good mood wanes.”

Tristan eyed him for a moment. He did not give it good odds that the Izcalli would outright tell him what the trial was, so an indirect angle would yield more.

“What is it about the Trial of Contest that warrants the personal attention of a professor and the senior signifier on the island?”

The man pushed up his spectacles.

“Clever,” he praised. “I cannot speak for Captain Yue, but my interest lies in the fact that this will be the second use of the Lugar Vacio since Scholomance was closed. The first was the better part of a year before I arrived here, so this is my first opportunity to behold it with my own eyes.”

Tristan’s brow rose.

“So this Trial of Contest is not some fresh invention?” he pressed.

“It has been in practice almost as long as the Watch has used Scholomance as a school,” Professor Sasan replied.

That was less than reassuring, considering that Scholomance was rumored to have closed because too many students died even by the harsh standard of the blackcloaks. Which reminded him, while he had a historian at hand…

“Why did Scholomance close, anyway?” Tristan asked. “The Watch cannot own so many aether wells it would leave one unoccupied without good reason.”

“There was no single reason, but admittedly one did tip the balance the way of closure,” Professor Sasan mused. “We are a stubborn folk, our order – but even we balked at continuing to send children in after the third year in a row that the entire roster died.”

Tristan winced. About what he’d feared.

“So what changed since?”

The man laughed.

“The blood dried,” Sasan said.

Tristan extricated himself as swiftly as possible after that, returning to his cabal. For such a cheerful man, Tenoch Sasan had one of the bleakest senses of humor he’d ever seen.

The friendship with Wen made more sense now, he’d admit.

—

Scholomance could be beautiful, Angharad thought, as the deadliest of things tended to be.

It was an eerie sort of beauty but no less moving for it. Their company strode through broken halls painted with the light of some pale moon, a passage of faded mosaics whose colors must have once been bewitching and a strange garden whose every flower and stalk of grass was marble. Captain Yue stood in the lead and traced symbols in the air with Gloam every few minutes, sometimes changing their direction strangely afterwards – going through cramped stairs downwards to end up on the second story, or taking a closet door to end up in a great hall. Her curiosity must have been visible, for it received answer.

“It’s a Sign,” Maryam quietly explained. “Didactic.”

“I am not familiar with the meaning – as related to your arts, that is,” Angharad said.

“Didactic Signs are both external and internal, relating to abstract concepts,” the Izvorica recited. “On the Bluebell, when the captain enclosed the Saint inside invisible walls, it was a Didactic Sign as he used.”

The other woman frowned.

“This one appears to be about connection,” Maryam said. “Two things being one. It must be some kind of pathfinding trick, like a Gloam compass.”

Angharad inclined her head in thanks at the explanation, receiving a grunt as answer. These were not impressive manners, but the noblewoman let it pass. She could not take issue with it when she had yet to find a way to make restitution for her own lacking courtesies. After one last turn through a forlorn dance hall whose checkered tiles were strewn with broken glass from fallen chandeliers, they emerged into a small antechamber of bare stone with a small door half-ajar.

Captain Yue traced her Sign again, then glanced through the door and gave a satisfied nod before shooting a glance at the ceiling.

“Tried to waylay us with the Basilisk Garden, did you?” she said, clicking her tongue. “Come now, I know my filters. You’ll have to do better than that.”

“I find that when arguing with immortals one rarely gets the last word,” Professor Sasan noted.

The Tianxi signifier glanced at him with a hard smile.

“There’s no such thing as immortality, Tenoch,” Captain Yue replied. “Even the Gloam will end.”

The man rolled his eyes behind his spectacles.

“If you insist on being part of a cult, Yue, you could at least pick one with good festivals,” he said. “There’s a temple out in Totochtin that-”

One of the blackcloaks behind them cleared his throat, loudly. The professor appeared somewhat chastised, but not so the signifier.

“We can go in,” Captain Yue said. “It’s the right room.”

The pair preceded the rest of them in, Angharad was first in their wake. She had not been sure what to expect, but somehow it had not been this: the room was surprisingly mundane.

It could have passed as some lord’s solar back home, with that pretty wooden paneling on the walls and floor. Geometric tapestries hung on the sides, a little heavy on the red for her tastes but more than acceptable, and the lanterns were delicate ironwork. Only there was no furniture and the floor paneling had been scraped, as if heavy objects were dragged out of the room – and in the very center, bursting out of the floor like a jutting nail, stood a doorway.

An arch of stone, simple gray blocks perfectly interlocked.

An empty doorway leading to nowhere, she thought, but then she thought she glimpsed something through and it was not the back of the room. It was… Angharad frowned, taking a step closer, and pricked her ear. She could almost hear a song, faint as it was. A voice was singing, slow and light, but there was also something more. An undertone, deeper. It was not coming from the other side.

 The Pereduri swallowed drily when she realized that the other sound was the Fisher humming along.

A hand came to rest on her shoulder, shaking her out of her trance.

“Easy now,” Professor Sasan said. “Crossing that doorway without first taking the proper precautions would be unwise.”

Angharad swallowed again when she saw that she was three steps closer to the doorway than she recalled.

“What lies beyond, professor?” she asked.

“A complicated question,” the Izcalli said. “By itself? Not much. Something that failed to become a layer and was subsumed by Scholomance.”

The noblewoman licked her lips.

“I could make out a song,” she admitted.

The professor’s brow rose above his spectacles.

“That makes you one in a hundred,” he said. “I can’t hear so much as a whistle myself. There must be great deal of fear in you.”

Angharad went stiff as a board at the insult.

“Pardon me?” she forced out.

“That is what lies on the other side of the doorway, Tredegar,” Professor Sasan said. “Fear. To be precise, a great moment of terror that was too short-lived to form into a layer but still left a mark in the aether.”

Before Angharad could bite out that she was no coward, and what would an Izcalli know of courage anyway, Song cleared her throat and stepped between them.

“You mentioned that it was consumed by Scholomance,” the Tianxi said. “What has it become now?”

The man pushed up his glasses.

“There is Izcalli a plant called the butterwort,” he said, “whose viscous leaves trap insects that land on them, slowly dissolving and digesting them.”

Professor Tenoch Sasan spoke calmly, almost mildly, as if they were discussing nothing more than the weather.

“The Lugar Vacio, the place beyond the doorway, is much the same. It will bring out your deepest fears, make you lose yourself within and then feed on you until either your mind or body shatters.”

Angharad swallowed again. There was a long moment of silence.

“Usually I’d say something about this not being the worst way I spent a sixthday,” Tristan noted. “But this honestly might just be it.”

Angharad turned a half-fond look on the shrugging man, Maryam choking out a laugh. The look on Song’s face, however, did not change: guilt. She was regretting roping them into this. Angharad understood why, but did not share the doubt. If the Watch did not believe the trial worth taking, it would not have been put up on that wall for Song to take.

“I would not expect the Watch would indulge in petty torments,” Angharad said. “Surely there is some purpose to this trial?”

It was not the professor that answered, to her surprise.

“It’s soul-tempering,” Maryam said. “My people’s signifiers have a tradition not unlike this, though a little god rides your soul instead.”

“Experiencing emotional extremes strengthens one’s soul,” Captain Yue agreed. “Especially when it happens within an aether well – you’ve had Theology already, so you should have an inkling as to why.”

Professor Sasan cleared his throat.

“It is also preparation for field conditions,” he added. “There are gods and lemures that can inflict terror, and to have lived through such a thing in controlled conditions significantly increases your chances of survival.”

Sensible, Angharad thought. Scarred skin was tougher when given time to heal. Tristan cleared his throat.

“If any emotion will do, I don’t suppose there’s a joy doorway lying around we could take instead?”

“Oh, they banned that one back when Scholomance was last open,” Professor Sasan idly said.

He shrugged.

“The suicide rate in the aftermath was simply too high.”

No one was quite sure what to answer to that.

—

Song went first.

It would have been beneath her not to, after what they had heard. A general led from the back, but a captain led from the front and Song yet claimed to be captain of the Thirteenth Brigade. She stood before the doorway in silence, Captain Yue slowly circling around her as she traced Signs in quick sequence – shimmering, oily darkness hung in the air for the barest heartbeats before fading. All that Song felt from the sorcery was a shiver of cold, until the other Tianxi traced one last Sign and closer her fist around a piece of darkness that almost looked like a Cathayan character.

She felt it then: she was tethered.

“You have bound my soul,” Song said.

“More accurately, I tied a rope around it so that I will be able to pull you out,” Captain Yue replied. “You will only remain two minutes inside – any longer and Scholomance will have nibbled away at the rope.”

She had a southern accent, Song noted.  Maybe Sanxing, though she could not know for sure without hearing Yue speak Cathayan.

“What will two minutes achieve?” she asked.

“Enough,” Captain Yue snorted. “It won’t feel like a short time to you, Ren. Nor will you remember crossing the threshold.”

No, she thought, but I will see through the illusion. That might just give her an edge. She glanced back and found that Professor Sasan had cracked open a small leather journal, scribbling notes in it as he kept an eye on her – and was that a sketch of her standing in front of the doorway? It would have been improper to glare at a teacher but the urge was there. The soldiers were near the door and looking on with nothing more than mild interest, but her cabal at least was displaying some concern.

Abrascal’s face was a blank mask and Angharad looked as if she was pressing down her worries – no doubt to avoid giving insult by implying Song would not rise to the occasion – while Maryam was biting her lip. Song gave them a nod, then breathed out and turned to Captain Yue.

“I am ready,” she said.

“Then cross the threshold,” she said.

One, two, three steps and Song was-

—

Song Ren was no longer young.

She looked down at her hands, saw the wrinkles on her palm and strength on the wane.

It was not real. It was an illusion, Song Ren saw the truth of things and this was false-

-all her life Song had seen the world as an illusion, an unexpected repercussion of her contract, but she whatever her eyes might say she could feel the truth in her limbs. They ached as she walked up the path, her steps halting as she climbed the stairs on the side of the hill. How many years had it been since she last came here? Decades, not since she was a girl.

The stone steps were worn and strewn with leaves, the walk slippery enough she had to slow down for fear of falling. Song was out of breath when she reached the summit of the hill, barely forty years old and already worn out like a rag. Signifiers had kept her alive but even they could only do so much against the curse.

The funerary altar was half-rotten, a single candle shivering atop it. Someone was kneeling in front, an old woman burning a paper crane in a bowl, and from that thin flash of light Song made out rows of tombstones in the grass. Dozens upon dozens. Gods, so many. The old woman turned to look at her, tightly pulling her white robe around her frame.

“Song,” she said. “You come home at last.”

“I do not know you, elder,” she replied, softly approaching.

The laugh that earned her was unkind.

“Am I now your elder, jiejie?” she said.

Song’s breath caught in her throat. Jiejie – elder sister.

“Aihan?”

“Can you not recognize me at all?” the old woman bitterly asked.

“Yixiao,” Song croaked out. “I- how can…”

She had six years on her youngest sister, who now looked like she had thirty on Song.

“We do not all have the Watch to hide behind,” Yixiao said.

She fell to her knees by her youngest sister’s side, shying away from the contempt she found waiting in those dark eyes.

“Who are you burning the crane for?” she asked with a clumsy tongue.

Their kin would all be here, sleeping below the grass. Ren were always buried on raised ground, it was tradition.

“All of them,” Yixiao snorted. “Who else is left but us, Song?”

“Aihan-”

“Sickness took her two springs past,” Yixiao said. “She barely fought it, after a third child died in her.”

The worn woman that was her sister scoffed.

“She asked for you on her deathbed, in the throes of fever. For you to braid her hair like you used to.”

Song licked her lips.

“I left for you two,” she pleaded. “So that the curse would not sink into you like it did Mother, with the sickness and the miscarriages. So I could save us all.”

“Am I saved, then?” her sister thinly smiled.

Song swallowed and did not answer.

 “What is it that you even did for all these years, Song?” Yixiao challenged.

“I became a commander in the Watch, the regulars,” Song replied. “I lead near a thousand men.”

On an island garrison, where the greatest threat was fat seals honking on the beach. A glorified supply depot where dead-end careers were sent to molder. Song had gone to the regulars after her cabal failed to make a mark, but her name had been a rope around her neck. She had stalled, and when the curse began weakening her she was judged too compromised for combat postings – her late promotion to commander had been a sop, a gesture of pity.

“Have you won great glories, then?” Yixiao asked. “Did your honorable deeds redeem our family name?”

Song stared down at the overgrown grass, shamed.

“No,” she forced out.

“You abandoned us,” her sister harshly said, “and it was all for nothing. After you left Nianzu blamed himself for driving you off, did you know? He drank himself to death. The grief killed Mother.”

Song trembled.

“Haoran finally turned up after ten years: floating bell-up in a Jigong canal, his throat slit. That was the end of Father, I think. He hung on for a decade more, saw Aihan and I married, but he had nothing left to live for.”

A pause, a cruel twist of the lips.

“He went in his sleep.”

“I didn’t know,” Song whispered.

“Did you want to?” Yixiao said. “Did you even look back, after you fled to the Watch?”

“I thought I could break the curse,” she said.

Her sister snarled, sweeping the bowl off the altar and sending it crashing as she rose to her feet.

“You thought you could save yourself, you selfish bitch,” Yixiao roared out. “The arrogance of you, pretending yourself a savior because of some petty contract. Look out with your silver eyes, Song, look in the distance and tell me what you see.”

She did not dare disobey. Lights to the north, the remaining Luminaries bathing the republics in light. Only among the thriving cities there was a hole in the world, a dark stain – Jigong, or what had once been it. Now a land of ghosts and wild dogs, a broken and empty wasteland.

A graveyard of five hundred thousand souls, all of which had died cursing the name Ren.

“You failed,” her sister said. “You failed us, you failed them, you failed every soul that has ever been in the Circle and that will ever be.”

Yixiao took a knife out of her pale sleeves, but the edge against her own throat.

“No,” Song pleaded, but her limbs were aching and heavy as lead.

“If you had been better, you could have put an end to it,” her sister said. “But you can’t even prevent th-”

Something was tugging at Song, but she fought it. She could not abandon her sister again, she had to-

—

Captain Yue grunted as she tightened her grip around her Sign, giving the air a hard yank – and Song came stumbling out of the empty doorway she had disappeared in. She fell to her knees before them, shivering, and Tristan felt his blood run cold as he matched the red-ringed, dead eyes of the Tianxi.

“Gods,” Song wept. “Oh Gods.”

She shivered once more, then was noisily sick over the floor. Tredegar and Maryam went to help her up, leaving the thief subject to Captain Yue’s unimpressed gaze and raised eyebrow. He was already regretting having volunteered to go second.

“Come on,” the Navigator said, raising her hand. “No time to waste, Abrascal.”

Tristan swallowed and stepped forward to let her cover him in Signs before he ventured through the archway.

—

Click, snap, bang: red sprayed on stone, wet and coppery.

The furthest drop stopped barely a foot away from where he hid, clutching his knees and biting his tongue. Father’s corpse stayed upright for a heartbeat before toppling forward slowly, inevitably. There was a ruin of flesh where a face had once been but Tristan could not mistake the hair, the stubble. His eyes watered, his limbs shook. It should have been grief, but instead all he could think was this – when they picked up the body, what if they looked under the table?

“Better luck in the next spin, Abrascal,” Cozme Aflor said.

A woman’s scoff.

“Better that you pray for our luck, if anyone’s,” Doctor Ceret said. “He was one of our most stable subjects; his deterioration is terrible news.”

“You still have three living,” Cozme shrugged.

“Three is too few,” the doctor said. “I need another batch of subjects, and not vagrants grabbed off the street. Contracted-”

“Do not grow on trees, Lauriana,” a man mildly replied.

Mild, always mild. Like smoke, gentle until you choked on it.

“I am sure Lord Lorent can afford your fees, Ceferin,” the doctor dismissed. “House Cerdan may not be as rich as the Six, but they can fill your pockets plenty.”

“Gold is sweet,” Ceferin agreed, “but not so sweet I would forget to fear lead. We are beginning to draw attention, doctor. Desperate contractors die easy, but not often so many or so quickly.”

“We are near a breakthrough,” Doctor Ceret insisted. “The first subjects died in weeks but this batch lasted months. Our benefactor believes that the contract it gifts can-”

Cozme Aflor tucked his pistol into his belt and stepped closer to the table, crouching down to grab Father’s splattered collar and hoist up the corpse. He had his back to Tristan but the boy froze with fear, knowing that the smallest movement, the smallest noise, would be enough for- He didn’t even do anything. That was the most unfair part of it.

Cozme just happened to turn as he moved the body, and there was the boy plain to see.

“Shit,” the mustachioed man said, and reached for his knife.

Tristan ran out, slipping through Cozme’s grasp. Between the dark-haired doctor and the man with the mismatched eyes he fled, heart beating so fast it might burst. Shouts behind him, shouts ahead. Shadows twisting and writhing, barrels dripping blood – holding limbs like a grocer’s might apples. Lifeless eyes and trembling half-corpses, but he was running for the hatch they had come in through and he slipped, red under his feet and red on his knees as his trousers tore.

Cozme Aflor caught him by the neck.

He wrestled and fought and screamed and bit, but all it earned was Ceferin striking him across the face until he stopped. The doctor took his chin, studied him, and smiled with yellow teeth.

“Contracted,” Lauriana Ceret happily said. “Strap him in.”

 Contracted? No, he had not met-

-and Fortuna was shouting, swinging fists at Cozme and Ceferin as they dragged him to the table. But she could not touch them, could not hurt them, and though Tristan fought it he was struck in the face until he was dazed enough they could fit his limps to the straps. Lauriana Ceret stood over him, chirurgeon’s mask over her head: like an executioner’s leather hood with green glass for eyes. The point of the silvery blade in her hand rested on his belly.

“Let’s see what’s inside,” Doctor Ceret said, a smile in her voice.

And she cut and she cut and he screamed. Hours, days, months, until his limbs were not his own – sown on, twitching and aching – and his tongueless mouth rasped air beneath his sole, mangled eye. Until he felt a hand rest on his face and looked up to see golden hair above a splash of red.

“I’m sorry,” Fortuna whispered. “It’s too much, I can’t…”

And somewhere inside of him, somewhere not even the silver knives had reached, Tristan Abrascal felt a warmth end. A hearth empty.

She had left him behind.

—

When Tristan Abrascal was tugged out of the Lugar Vacio he did not vomit or shake or fall to his knees. His eyes were dry and his hands did not tremble.

He walked out of the room and did not come back.

“One of you follow him,” Professor Sasan ordered the soldiers. “We don’t want him to…”

He mimed a pistol pointed at one’s head, which set Angharad to grimacing. She left Song with Maryam, approaching the impatient Captain Yue – whose eyes kept straying to the pale-skinned woman. She came here to see how Maryam will fare, it is the only thing she cares about, Angharad realized.

That thought was of no comfort as the signifier warded her before sending her through the doorway.

—

How long had she been doing this?

Parry, turn, sweep the leg – the man tripped and Angharad’s saber sliced through his throat until it hit bone. She ripped her blade out of the flesh, the blademaster’s corpse blooming red on the floor, and stepped forward. Angharad could see him waiting at the end of the hall, the fat man with the eyes like ice. The one who owned the others, who had pulled the trigger that ended her mother’s life. All she needed was to take a hundred steps, one tile after another, and she would have him.

Only another blademaster walked out, black ink on black skin, and his sword was sharp: Angharad fought.

First she fought with honor. Cleanly, with salutes and rules and duels. But that only won her a step or two forward, so slow, and somewhere deep in her bones she knew that if she waited too long the man would leave.

So she bent the rules, ever so slightly.

She peered ahead with the Fisher’s foresight, took lives without thought to kindness or fairness. Only there was always another blademaster, another body in the way, and just peering was not enough. So she let him in a little further. She could not trust the old spirit but they both wanted to reach the end of the hall, to take bloody revenge on those responsible for it all.

Angharad struggled and killed and gave away piece after piece of herself, the Fisher turning her blood to seawater and her teeth into coral. But for every man she killed three rose, endless empty faces bearing swords. She howled and tore into them, but even now that the sound of the tides roared in her ears every step she took closer to the end of the hall was but a passing thing – every gain ended in reverse. Always.

And even as her wounds bled the sea and her bones turned to stone, as the Fisher wielded her for their rage entwined, she saw how it would end: Angharad was going to lose.

It had always been beyond her, utterly pointless from the start.

There was nothing glorious about the fight, nothing romantic. Her sacrifices had weighed on the scales nary more than a feather: she had made herself a beast and yet she could not get a single step closer. Their blades found purchase one after another, tireless killers running her down like a lion, and Angharad fell to her knees. That was when she heard them through the roar of the sea. The pleas.

“A little longer,” Uncle Arwel begged. “Just give her a little longer. She will come for me, I know she-”

Her little cousins, crying and promising she was only moments away. That she would save them if their executioners would only wait a little longer. Only Angharad was kneeling, bleeding and broken. She tried to rise, but her limbs were mere shreds. A man came to stand in front of her, protecting her.

“We are of the Watch,” Uncle Osian bit out, “you cannot-”

The blade burst out of his back and Angharad screamed, loud enough it drowned out her uncle’s shout of pain. She fought and struggled but there was nothing left to move. She had spent it all, and she had failed.

She did not come to him, in the end. He came to her, leaving his end of the hall as the shadows parted like curtains. The tall, fat man with the eyes like ice. His pistol slowly rose, came to rest on her forehead as he stared down at her.

“It was the wrong choice, Lady Maraire,” he chided. “All the wrong choices.”

The finger pulled the trigger and Angharad Tredegar knew noth-

—

Tredegar was bleeding from the eyes, when she stumbled out. Captain Yue looked interested for a heartbeat, before passing her off to Professor Sasan – who was visibly itching to draw the ashen-faced noblewoman letting herself be guided around like a child.

Maryam swallowed, meeting Yue’s eyes.

“Come, Maryam,” the captain smiled. “I have been wondering about this one all day.”

—

“Savage ways,” Tredegar smiled, “lead to savage ends.”

“It would not have come to this if you had made an effort,” Song said.

Tristan looked away.

“Too much trouble,” he simply said.

The soldiers that escorted her onto the ship said she was merely expelled, but Maryam knew better even before the butt of the musket struck her in the back. She struggled, clawed and shouted at her attackers, but the watchmen knocked her out and put her in the hold with the others. It was the same as the one she’d seen as a girl: bruised, angry men shackled to rings set in the floor and wall. A crowded, sweating pit where men were made into merchandise.

She was half-starved and half-mad by the time she got out. How long had she been down there in the dark, failing to trace a Sign that might save her. Maryam need not be a slave if she could just prove she could learn, that there was not something wrong in the marrow of her bones, slithering through her veins. That she was not born to be clasped in chains.

Captain Totec waited for her on the shore, even as the others were sent to fields and mines to die in labor like all those bought and sold. The white-haired man with the gentle eyes looked mournful, as he clapped the irons around her wrists. Put the collar around her neck.

“It is my fault,” he said. “I overestimated you, Maryam. I thought your block was temporary, that you would overcome it. I am sorry that I expected too much.”

The gentleness was so much worse than a whip would have been.

“I can still learn,” she pleaded. “I sought help, Captain Yue-”

“Found you worthless,” Totec told her. “She is the one who decided to send you here.”

That should have hurt, should have burned, and for a heartbeat it did – but then Maryam felt empty. Hollow. Captain Totec frowned.

“Do not worry, you will not remain in our hands,” he said. “We will sell you to the Malani and-”

Maryam blinked. This… no, this could not be.

“The Watch does not practice slavery,” she slowly said. “And Captain Totec hates slavers. This doesn’t sound like him at all.”

Through the void inside her she could hear a voice whispering, subtle and sibilant. It is just a front, he thought you were useful, they are just waiting for you to prove you are worthless to-

“That was before-” the false thing began, but she struck at it.

Her hands passed through smoke, undoing the specter for a heartbeat before it coalesced again in Captain Totec’s shape. Its face was blank.

“Dun?” it asked.

A wave of pure, unadulterated terror bowled Maryam over. She staggered back, limbs twitching as she – and then her soul emptied once more. It was not instant, as she had first thought. It was as if there was a hole somewhere in her and the terror poured out through it.

“No, lucent,” it said. “But worthless.”

—

Maryam’s back hit the floor, which still reeked faintly of vomit, and it beat the breath out of her. The first thing she saw above her was Captain Yue’s fascinated expression.

“It is over?” she asked.

“Probably,” the older Navigator said.

Maryam frowned.

“What do you mean, probably?”

“It means that you were only in there for thirteen seconds,” Captain Yue said. “I didn’t pull you back, Maryam.”

The Tianxi grinned.

“Scholomance spat you out.”

# Chapter 21

Steady breath, eyes ahead, walk like he had a reason for it.

It bought Tristan the ten breaths he needed to leave and step past the antechamber into the glass-strewn ballroom, where he let himself slump against the wall. Forehead and palms on the stone, the coolness steadying, and still his breath caught. Panic was a blind thing, an animal whose frenzy would get you killed, but his head cared not: it spun, and behind the shakes spreading down his limbs lurked worse. The sight of her fading, of leaving, of aband–

A hand on his neck, soft as a feather.

“Tristan,” Fortuna murmured. “What happened?”

His fists clenched. Do not weep. Weeping was the sound of the wounded, the weak, and rats fed on rats just like they did everything else. He hammered at the wall with his fist to give his fingers a reason to shake. Some small, pathetic part of him wanted to ask her if it was true: whether she would leave should he be caught and broken, whether she’d grow bored or sick and… Tristan traced out that part of him, like chalk on stone, and wiped it clean. Like Abuela had taught him.

Fear, pain and grief, they were just humors of the body. Smudges on the mind, like chalk on stone. Trace them, wipe them and walk away, Abuela’s voice whispered in his ear.

“Nothing,” he forced out. “It was all a trick.”

“The god hurt you,” the Lady of Long Odds said as she withdrew her hand, voice gone cold.

“I hurt myself,” Tristan said. “It just helped.”

He pushed himself off the wall, tugged his coat down into place. His eyes were dry but he knew they would be red-ringed, and the roof of his mouth was so parched it stung to pass his tongue over it. Fortuna was standing close, but her eyes were not on him – instead they followed along the length of the ceiling to and fro, as if following a butterfly’s flight.

Then she went still, and suddenly it burned cold to behold her. Golden eyes and golden hair like a distant star, skin like porcelain and a dress like a gushing wound. Too much of what she was for the world to suffer it without trembling.

“Death and defeat,” the goddess scorned. “Did you think they were wings, child? They are chains, slowly tightening around your neck. One day we will find an end to pull, and when that last rattling gasp is torn out of you I will breathe it in and smile.”

And for a heartbeat he loved her for that. For being closer than a shadow and not being so in his corner so much as living in it. And maybe she could not love him back, not like a person could, but sometimes he thought it was close enough it didn’t matter.

Then the room groaned, shook, and a piece of the ceiling fell behind them.

Fortuna cleared her throat and when he turned back to her she was the goddess he knew once more, not a trace of that cold greatness left. A relief. She shot him a winning smile that was tinged slightly nervous.

“We should, uh, leave the room,” the Lady of Long Odds said. “I think it might have taken that personally.”

“You think?” Tristan got out, voice still hoarse.

“It’ll take more than loose masonry to impress me, you glorified shrine maiden,” Fortuna sneered at the ceiling. “And considering you are Scholomance, falling apart isn’t nearly as impressive as you seem to believe i-”

Tristan walked out of the ballroom before his goddess could get them buried alive. With the slate of his mind clear, he realized how stupid a risk he had taken by walking away from the others, even for so short a walk. He needed tempering. Song might have done him a favor, however accidentally. So long as there were eyes in his direction Scholomance should not have been able to change much, but-

Outside the ballroom he stood not in the stone antechamber but at the end of a long hall. There were four doors on each side and one on the opposite end – open – but the part that caught his eye was the glass cases covering the walls. They were full of human heads, each lovingly preserved and put on display. Men and women, most of them older. All of them wearing crowns. Some in silver, some in gold and a few in iron that- Tristan wrenched his gaze away.

Scholomance wanted to distract him, he could not let it get its way.

He hurried through the hall, heading for the open door. It should still connect to the same room, since there had been people inside to prevent Scholomance from moving it. He was barely halfway through when movement to his right had him reaching for his knife. Only it was a blackcloak, not a lemure or devil. A large Someshwari man with a tattooed chin. As well as the usual sword and musket he had a wooden mace at his hip, unusually shaped. It looked almost like a bottle made of wood.

“There you are,” the watchman grunted. “Come on, before you get yourself killed.”

Tristan eyed the door at the end the hall. A trick, then. Scholomance had crafted an entire hallway so he would be inclined to follow its length when the real open door was one he might pass by without noticing. The school was clever, exactly like Professor Sasan had warned them. He followed the blackcloak through the door, finding a stone antechamber much like the one he had seen earlier: though now there were two doors, and both were closed.

“Where are the others?” the thief asked.

He had left before Maryan took her turn. It could be her talents would let her weather the experience better than he, but they might also make it a great deal worse.

“Your captain went into shock after throwing up,” the man replied. “They’re getting her to the hospital in a hurry.”

Tristan breathed in sharply.

“Everyone left?” he asked.

Even to his own ears his tone sounded plaintive. Like a whining child’s. He needed to master himself. The Someshwari looked amused.

“Don’t worry, we’re not lost,” he said.

He got out a small brass device that straddled the line between watch and compass, too thick for the former but with too many gears for the latter. There were two thick needles within, Tristan saw. One was pointing at the door to their left, the other behind them.

“Tristan, right?” the man asked.

He nodded.

“Dev,” the watchman introduced himself. “This is a roseless cardinal compass, though we usually call them cardinals. Your cabal will be handed one later this year – it points at a part of Scholomance determined by the needle, in this case the front gates.”

“And it works?” Tristan asked, skeptical. “Would Scholomance not simply shift the paths to keep us away?”

“Keeping that going forever would take more power than it’s got,” Dev told him. “It takes time and effort for the school shift itself, so if you follow the needle and you’re careful all Scholomance will achieve is making it a longer way.”

The god in the walls was not all-powerful, then. Professor Sasan had implied it fed on generations of students, but it must have been at least a century since the school closed. It might just be feeling starved, and weaker for it.

“That’s what Captain Yue was doing,” he grasped.

The older man nodded.

“Navigators do it better,” Dev freely admitted. “Their Sign lets them ‘see’ ahead some, so the school can’t shift rooms as close as it can for us. It’ll likely take us longer to get back, though if we’re lucky we might end up close enough the captain can detour to retrieve us.”

The gray-eyed man hummed. A very useful device, that. And one that explained the bounties Song had mentioned taking  place within Scholomance. With such a tool a cabal venturing inside to fulfill it would not simply disappear into the depths to be devoured.

“So if the first needle serves to point at the gates, what is the second for?” Tristan asked.

Dev shrugged.

“Fucked if I know,” he casually said. “The last user must have forgotten to put it back. It could lead anywhere, really.”

Tristan made himself smile. That answer, he thought, had been just a little too casual. Practiced. The thief could not afford recklessness, so he must find an angle. Provoke a reaction. Pretend to run off? No, heavy-handed and potentially a mistake. A leading question? He had left too quickly, so he had too little to work with. Although… Scholomance could make sounds so it likely could kill them as well, but the knee-jerk would still be there.

“We should call out for the others, see if they are close enough to hear,” Tristan idly suggested.

Dev’s face tightened for only the barest of moments before it smoothed away. Shit.

“Feel free to try,” the watchman shrugged. “It might work.”

Tristan smiled again, put it on slow and trusting.

“Thank you,” he said, turning towards the door as if to call out.

All the while he hid his hand under his cloak, reaching for his knife and – he caught only a flicker a movement, but that made the difference between taking the hit on the head and on the shoulder. Tristan yelped, backing off with a wince as the watchman drew back his wooden mace.

“Fucking Masks,” Dev said. “I should have asked double for one of you.”

“HELP,” Tristan shouted, drawing his knife.

The watchman snorted.

“You think Scholomance will let that out when we’re fighting?” he said. “No, it wants blood on the floor. No help for you, boy.”

Still worth trying.

Dev had a foot on him and was built like a bear. There was fat to that belly but muscle as well, and that was the worst kind of foe for someone using a knife. Even if he got a good blow in it’d be hard to make it a killing one. I need to cripple a limb, Tristan thought, giving ground even as the watchman idly spun his mace and advanced. Closing the distance without being struck would be difficult, given the man’s greater reach, but it was his only chance. Maybe a distraction, a-

Hesitation cost him. Dev suddenly charged in, swinging down, and the thief backed away again – only it was a feint and the watchman flicked his wrist again as he bounded forward, catching Tristan on the side of the head. Cursing, vision swimming, he swung at the man’s arm but only cut into the thick coat. It got him punched in the stomach. Tristan folded with a wheeze, but through the pain he saw an opening and drew his pistol. He pointed at the man’s chest and pulled the trigger even as the mace swatted away the gun.

The shot went wild, the pistol spun on the ground and Tristan was struck in the belly again. This time he convulsed as he felt to his knees, beginning to puke, but Dev kicked him over so he was looking up. He heaved drily, the bile not quite leaving his throat, and the large Someshwari snorted at the sight as he raised his mace-

Thunder, smoke.

—

The Zhangshou-pattern musket was of smaller caliber than the mainstay of the Republics, the Jifeng, but fired from this close on an unmoving target?

The watchman’s knee burst like a tomato left too long under the sun.

Song, her mind still and clear as a frozen pond, closed the gap even as the man attacking her cabalist dropped to his knee with a scream. He half-turned, hitting out behind him with the mudgar mace, but it was blind flailing. Song flipped her musket, cleanly hammering at the back of his head with the butt. The man dropped like a sack of rice. From the corner of her eye she saw that Tristan had pushed himself onto his hands and knees, but his eyes were still out of focus. The Someshwari watchman groaned, reaching for the musket he had dropped, but she kicked it away.

“Tristan?” she called out.

She barely recognized her own voice. It sounded like another woman’s – faint, empty.

“Alive,” the thief said, licking his lips and grimacing. “It will bruise, but nothing permanent.”

“You honorless shit,” the watchman on the ground said. “From behind.”

Song tossed away her musket, reaching for her sword and sliding it out. Hand and torso at the right angle, drill-perfect. Her hand was on the chisel.

“What happened?” she asked.

“Our friend Dev here said you’d all gone ahead and I should follow him,” Tristan replied, getting onto his knees. “I smelled a trap, and you saw how the ensuing brawl was going.”

With him being thoroughly thrashed. What had the watchman been up to? Was it even the same soldier from earlier, or had this cursed school slipped in a fake that-

“He mentioned getting paid,” the gray-eyed man added.

The bounty, Song realized. This was not a Scholomance trap or the man going mad, this was about that misbegotten bounty someone had put on Tristan’s head.

“Honorless,” she said at the prone man, disbelieving. “You call me honorless when you try to bag one of us for sale– and now, now of all the hours in all the days.”

She could still feel the grass against her legs, taste the smoke of the paper crane through the vomit in her mouth. Song could still see the contempt in her sister’s eyes, how she had deserved it. And now this, this utter – Dev, still face down against the ground, laughed.

“You silver spoon brats,” he groaned. “Everything handed to you, not a-”

He suddenly scrambled for the mace he’d dropped. Ice cracked. He dared, still dared. Song snarled and swung, the angle perfect and the flick of the wrist practiced and nothing half so satisfying as the thunk as her sword carved through half the fingers on that hand. He screamed and drew back the mangled hand. Dry-eyed, she kicked him belly up and stripped him of his blade before tossing it in a corner. The mace followed a moment later.

She should have done that from the start. Song needed to concentrate, to stop making mistakes that would cost everyone around her.

“You can’t,” Dev moaned. “I’m a watchman, you can’t-”

“You are a corpse, unless you talk,” Tristan said, still on his knees. “Who paid you?”

His eyes were sharp now. He was entirely there and no happier about that than she. Gods, Song had only left to fetch them because she could not bear to look at the way Angharad was bleeding. Dev’s dark eyes went to the thief, afraid, then to Song. She raised her arm, sharp edge still dripping his blood.

“I don’t know,” the man swore. “There were no names. They paid me to bring him to the west gate, alive.”

Tristan started, muttering something about a ‘second needle’, but that was not what Song needed. She rested the point of her sword on the wounded man’s throat. Not cutting into the flesh, only pressing. A measured threat, her hand was on the chisel.

“Descriptions,” she ordered.

“They wore hoods,” Dev said, then hurried on at the look on her face. “Young though, students. One sounded Izcalli.”

She waited a moment longer for him to go on. He did not. She couldn’t help it: Song laughed incredulously.

“That’s it?” she said. “That is all you have to say?”

Her grip tightened around the hilt of her sword until it hurt. Blood on her blade, her Mask savaged and all she had won for it was this? Panes shattered like glass.

“One sounded Izcalli,” she mocked in a deep voice. “Do you have any idea how many fucking Izcalli student there are on this island, you –” Antigua failed her, “you gouzazhong.”

“Song,” Tristan said, somehow on his feet. “We shouldn’t-”

“You think I’m the fool? You attacked a watchman, girl,” Dev interrupted, sneering up at her. “You think that won’t make it onto your record? That the stain won’t follow you for the rest-”

And he was right, she realized. It would be their word against his, and though she was confident they would come out ahead in the hearing the incident would be added to her record. She had shot a watchman from behind. Every superior officer she could ever have would know she had crippled someone wearing the black. Who would trust her after that? Who would let her stand behind them?

Song had already seen how bad it would be, fighting against the tide, and now mere minutes out of that place she was somehow making it all worse. She had learned nothing, made all that pain and grief pointless.

Crack.

“-of your life,” the man laughed. “You’re fucked, brat, you-”

Her hand slipped.

It was not the blow of a duelist or a soldier: her blade hacked into the man’s face like a butcher knife.

“You trash,” she snarled, ripping her blade out and hacking down again. “You relic, you-”

Song screamed and struck again. And again, and again and again. He had cornered her, ended her career. Only when her arm hurt and her breath was ragged did the silver-eyed girl fall to her knees, choking out a sob, fingers closed around the chisel she had used to make a ruin of the watchman. He no longer moved. Her eyes were tearing up. Someone crouched down on the other side of the corpse, and suddenly she remembered Tristan was there. Had been there the whole time.

“Oh,” she softly exhaled.

It was bad, but she could not bring herself to resent it. She was a rag wrung dry.

“Oh,” he repeated, almost gently. “Hello, Song Ren.”

Her lips thinned.

“I am not a wild animal,” she said, swallowing. “I don’t need-”

No words left her throat. The gray-eyed man shook his head, brown locks tumbling.

“I greet you,” Tristan said, “because we just met for the first time.”

Her fists clenched.

“I am not this,” she hissed.

“This is all we are,” he replied. “The rest is just what we wrap around so the nerve is not exposed.”

The last of the rage retreated like the tide, leaving behind a long shore of anguish and horror. Gods, what had she done? Tristan rose slowly, gingerly.

“This is a failure,” Song croaked. “I was only coming to fetch you, not to-”

The thief crouched and leaned forward, checking the pulse on Dev’s neck. He might as well check a roasted pig for blush. There was blood everywhere, including the neck, so after withdrawing it Tristan wiped his finger on the watchman’s clothes.

“He was right,” Song forced out, the taste bitter. “This will be in our dossiers. It will follow us everywhere.”

“He has a cardinal compass with a needle pointing to the west gate,” Tristan said. “That will lend weight to our words when we say he meant to grab me and take me there.”

“It’s not enough,” she tiredly replied. “We would need to catch those waiting for him as well, and unless they are great fools we will not.”

She considered it a moment, bringing this to Captain Yue. The other party will not be idling in front of the gate like idiots, just keeping a watch from distance. They’ll run when they see it. And we do not have anyone who looks like Dev even from a distance to try baiting them close. It would not be enough.

“It will be our word and a needle it is not a crime to possess,” Song said. “They won’t expel us for it, but we will be marked. I killed a watchman, Tristan.”

“Did you?” he quietly asked.

Her eyes flicked up.

“You can’t be serious,” Song said.

“Repeat after me,” he said. “We did not run into any watchman. You found me in a trap and helped me out, which is how you lost your cloak.”

Song slowly blinked.

“What?” she said. “My cloak is fine.”

“It isn’t,” Tristan said, gesturing at her chest. “There’s too much blood splatter, it will smell even if we wipe it. You’ll wear mine and I’ll go without.”

The Tianxi looked down and swallowed. There were flecks of red everywhere. She had not even noticed.

“They’ll know,” Song said. “When they see the corpse-”

“He is still alive,” Tristan said. “He has a pulse.”

That should have been a relief but it landed on her like a gut blow. She looked down at the face she had made a ruin and it sank in, one inch at a time, that senior officers might witness what she had done in her frenzy. Her professor. The senior signifier on the island. Song was going to be sick.

“This is important,” Tristan calmly said, “so that if truth tellers ever ask us whether we killed him we can saywe did not.”

She licked her lips.

“If he lives-”

“He won’t,” the thief said, getting up. “Is it looking at us, Song? Scholomance.”

The Tianxi swept the walls and ceiling with her gaze, finding the curls of smoke writhing around them, and slowly nodded. The god was everywhere, dripping from the walls like vines. Drinking in the violence that had taken place here.

“I know you’re listening,” Tristan said, and it was not until he looked up at the ceiling she realized who it was he was addressing. “We could still kill him, you know. Put him out of his misery. But I’ll make you a trade: let us get back to Captain Yue without waylaying us, and we’ll leave him like he is.”

Song’s jaw clenched.

“That,” she said, “is a fate worse than death.”

To be slowly devoured by this place, piece by piece? She could think of few ends worse. And Tristan hesitated, looking down at the watchman. But he saw something there that snuffed out the hesitation like a candle and then suddenly the gray was steel, merciless.

“I wonder,” Tristan Abrascal softly said, “if they would have used silver knives too.”

He looked up at the ceiling again.

“I’ll even bind his knee for you,” Tristan offered, “so he doesn’t bleed out too quick.”

The sound that answered him wasn’t a laugh, not the way men laughed. It was wood groaning and floors creaking; it was the wind through an empty hall and iron turning to rust. It was stone and darkness and patience. And it laughed as gods do, the echo of it rattling her bones.

Tristan licked his lips.

“Song?”

Like a breath sucked in. That was the only way she could describe the way the Scholomance had vanished. Not a speck of it left, though somehow Song knew it was yet watching them.

“It is gone,” she said. “I can’t see it anymore.”

And what was left to do?

Song got rid of her blood-spattered cloak and they got their stories straight while Tristan bound the knee. The others were on the other side of the open door at the end of the hall, where she had left them.

It did not even take a minute to reach them but somehow it felt like years.

—

Something was wrong.

Song and Tristan were tense during the journey out of Scholomance, but Maryam did not think much of it: who wasn’t? Tredegar was looking in the distance and seeing nothing, dry blood crusting under her eyes as she followed the group without a sound. Even Captain Yue was unsettled at how one of their escorts was tricked by Scholomance right under her nose, trying to find a trace of the soldier through seeking Signs but finding nothing.

“It moved aggressively right after feeding through the Lugar Vacio,” Professor Sasan mused. “Unusual, that. The school tends to release those it supped on in the hopes they will return.”

He interrogated the pair on the nature of the trap Song had rescued Tristan from, the gray-eyed man doing most of the talking. It sounded like a nasty piece of work, not unlike the rumors she had heard about the temple to a clockwork god that Tredegar and her company had encountered back on the Dominion. He had been lucky to get away with only a few knocks, and that Song had been quick thinking enough to sacrifice her cloak pulling him out.

Professor Sasan was demonstrably right about one thing, at least: it took them barely half as long to exit Scholomance as it had taken them to reach the depths. Captain Yue kept a metaphorical eye out for the missing soldier on their way back, pushing herself enough that Maryam could feel her nav filling the air, but Scholomance was disinclined to spit out its meal. The signifier, far from her visible excitement earlier, looked almost sullen as they crossed the entrance hall and passed through the great gates.

“I will file the report personally,” Captain Yue told them. “It is a rare for anyone gone missing to be seen again, but we should make the attempt regardless.”

“I wish you the best of luck,” Tredegar said, voice hoarse from her long silence.

Song said nothing, simply nodding, while Maryam thanked the captain for her help and pretended not to notice Yue trying to catch her eye. No doubt the older woman would like to interrogate her when the impressions were fresh, but she had no intention of going anywhere but back to the cottage. Something was definitely wrong with Song and Tristan: him being chattier with an authority figure had been a warning sign, but that Song had not even bothered to vocalize her goodbye to the senior Akelarre on the island was another.

That and Maryam could not remember them so much as looking at one another on the way back.

Professor Sasan and the remaining soldiers took their leave moments after, headed back towards the docks, and the four of them were left to stand alone in a stretch of stone. The Orrery lights above – gold and green, feeling of ripeness to her nav – lazily flowed through in stripes, but somehow the emptiness around them loomed. Standing beneath the grand façade Scholomance only reminded them of how small they truly were. Tredegar opened her mouth, but Song cut through.

“Back to the cottage first,” she said. “We can… address things there.”

After the better part of a week of going back and forth to their hidden home, there was hardly any need for pathfinding. When they crossed through the open grounds of a gutted temple a handful of lemures followed after them, wolf-like in shape and silent on their feet, but once Maryam pointed her pistol they scattered. The monsters seemed wary to attack if it was not an ambush, and after following them for a few minutes to further lack of opportunities they abandoned the chase.

The long trek up the stairs felt short, so eager was she to return to the safety of walls, and she was not alone in her haste. Tredegar kept pace and more, the two of them several times slowing their steps not to leave behind the other pair – which, she saw with a frown, were mere feet away from each other but still behaved like so much as brushing elbows would turn them to salt.

The tense silence that had taken hold of them on the way back lingered even when they put away their arms and cloaks and drifted towards the drawing room. No one wanted to be the first to talk, Maryam suspected. Song silently busied herself making a pot of tea while Tredegar sat at the kitchen table, looking down at her hands, and Tristan stood by the windows looking out into the garden. She went to join him, leaving off the others for now.

“I’d ask how you are,” Maryam quietly said, “but I expect the answer is the same for all of us.”

She did not much feel like conversation, in truth, but she had been in the room the shortest of them. Suffered the least. It was her duty to look after the others.

“Looking back, it made mistakes,” Tristan mused. “Details that were wrong. But when I was inside it did not matter.”

“It affected our minds,” Maryam agreed.

He breathed in slowly, shallowly.

“The Lugar Vacio,” the gray-eyed man finally said. “The Empty Place. I wonder why they call it that.”

A soft laugh. They both turned towards its source: Angharad Tredegar was looking at them.

“It is not obvious?” she asked. “That room, it is empty. It can only wield what you brought in with you.”

Maryam had a sharp retort on the tip of her tongue but she swallowed it. Tristan’s gaze lingered on the noblewoman for a moment longer, then he looked away without answering. Seeing that for the dead end it was, Maryam moved to the table. She was no pardoner, filled to the brim with love and forgiveness, so she sat across Tredegar instead of besides her. The Izvorica opened her mouth, but she was cut off by a shake of the head.

“Don’t,” Tredegar said. “You were in there for mere moments, were you not? Do not pretend you went through the same thing.”

“None of us went through the same thing,” Maryam replied, not unkindly. “That was the point.”

“That is not what I meant, which you know,” Tredegar flatly said.

She was more on edge that the Izvorica had realized if she was willing to make statements about what someone else knew – the Pereduri usually stepped around such things, the habit of someone avoiding even the possibility of a lie. Maryam raised her hands in concession. Song came to join them, brusquely setting down the iron teapot on the table. Three cups soon joined it, the Tianxi pouring herself the first without a word. Tristan, drawn in by the assembly, raised an eyebrow.

“No cup for me?” he teased.

He always refused it when offered, though it was true Song usually offered regardless.

“No,” the Tianxi bit out angrily.

Maryam’s brow rose at the tone. Tredegar absent-mindedly passed a hand through her braids.

“You can have mine,” the dark-skinned woman offered, pushing it his way.

Tristan was about to decline, the Izvorica saw, but then Song caught the cup and moved it back to the middle of the table.

“No cup,” Song harshly said, “for you. After what you-”

She breathed in deeply. Tredegar frowned, eyes moving back and forth between them.

“What did you do, Tristan?” she asked.

Maryam could smell the blackpowder in the air.

“We should rest,” she firmly said. “Speak on all this when we have a night’s sleep in us.”

No one answered her, but no one said anything at all so it was better than she had hoped for. Tristan, who had yet to sit, turned away. Headed back to his perch up in the tower, no doubt.

“Eat something first, at least,” Maryam called out. “We should get a meal in before-”

“Enough.”

She turned to find Song’s face a cold mask.

“Let him skitter away,” she ordered. “I do not have the stomach for sitting at a table with him and pretending like nothing happened.”

Tredegar rose to her feet.

“I ask again, then. What happened?”

She did not sound like she would let herself be talked out of getting an answer a second time and that was the exact moment, Maryam thought, when the powder caught.

“Yes,” Tristan mildly said. “Why don’t you tell them what happened, Song, since you are feeling so chatty?”

“The soldier did not go missing,” Song said. “I good as killed him to save Abrascal’s hide and he talked me into giving Scholomance the body.”

“I talked you into that?” the gray-eyed man scorned. “I said we should take it to the captain. You were the one agonizing about a mark on your record. All I did was clean up the mess.”

“You lied to Captain Yue?” Tredegar asked, sounding aghast.

Missing, Maryam thought, that the pair had fed a still-living man to Scholomance. That was… Her fists clenched. The watchman must have been trying to sell out Tristan, reading between the lines. She would give no sympathy to slavers, no matter how grisly their fate.

“I fought the man in defense of a subordinate,” Song flatly told the Pereduri. “Had I sufficient proof I would have come forward with it, but there was none.”

“That,” Tredegar evenly said, “is not an answer to my question.”

“I did what I must to save his damn life, Angharad,” Song harshly replied, pointing at Tristan.

“And what is that worth, when you were the reason for the danger?” the thief laughed. “I’m not the one who decided to drag us into the mindfuck room for some points on a board, Song. Or to have one of our own escorts bribed to-”

“Because you never decide anything, Tristan,” Song snarled. “It just happens to you. Like a misfortune, because that’s what you are. A child holding the leash to a calamity god, deluded enough to think you’re the one pulling while making everything around you awful, always.”

She stepped around the table and up to him, prodding a finger at his chest. In the Sacromontan’s eyes Maryam glimpsed the promise of violence. Did he still have a knife on him? She couldn’t risk it, moved forward.

“We have enemies like fleas, we get tripped up everywhere and now I killed a watchman,” Song shouted. “I had it planned, Tristan. I had it all planned, and since I ran into you it has all being going to-”

Maryam pushed down Song’s hand, steeling herself through the betrayed look that earned her.

“Enough,” she said. “Your words step beyond what you believe, Song.”

“No,” Tristan said, quietly, savagely. “Let’s have it out for good, Maryam. Let’s all face the fact that Captain Ren is staring at our deepest, most intimate secrets – at everyone’s fucking secrets, all the time! – but we must all walk on eggshells and pretend it is not happening.”

He laughed scornfully.

“Not that you can read a room even with magic eyes. A calamity god, you fucking fool,” he said. “My goddess can’t even dislocate and suddenly she’s why everything goes to shit around you?”

He leaned in.

“If you want the reason for your stumbling, fetch a mirror,” he said. “Just leave me out of it. I won’t be bearing that cursed burden for you, Ren.”

If Song still had her sword, Maryam knew sure as dark that she would have drawn it. Help, of all places, came from Angharad Tredegar.

“Tristan, kindly cease,” the noblewoman sharply said. “Song did you grave offense by speaking of your contract, but wild accusations-”

“It is a fact she is cursed,” Tristan interrupted. “She has to purge it out. Don’t you, captain?”

Tredegar’s face closed and she turned a hard look on the Tianxi.

“Is this true, Song?” she asked.

“What does it matter?” Song replied.

“We have suffered harsh turns since coming here,” the dark-skinned woman said, “and you never once thought to inform us that you are cursed?”

Tredegar grit her teeth.

“How many of our reverses came from it?”

“That is not how it works,” Maryam sharply. “It lingers in her, not on others.”

“You knew?” Tredegar asked, then shook her head. “Of course you did. And you will forgive me, Maryam, if I do not take for pure truth the opinion of a woman who did not argue when called the worst signifier on Tolomontera.”

The Izvorica’s nails bit into the palm of her hand.

“You want a reason why we’ve been having troubles?” Maryam coldly asked. “It probably didn’t help that you picked a fight with the single most influential cabal within hours of your boots touching the docks.”

“I protected a friend and ally,” Tredegar replied just as coldly. “And though there might have been consequences, at least I acted. What exactly have you done, Maryam Khaimov?”

She leaned in.

“Can you name a single contribution you have made to the Thirteenth?” she asked. “The sum of you, as far as I can see, has been nipping at my heels and then being run out of your own covenant class.”

Maryam’s jaw clenched, all the harder for her lack of answer.

“She’s not wrong it was a bad move to antagonize the Ninth,” Tristan said. “We recovered, but-”

“You have been detained, committed arson and twice attacked in less than a week,” Angharad evenly said. “I take no lessons from you on matters of trouble, Tristan Abrascal.”

“My decisions don’t bring consequences on the entire brigade, Tredegar,” he replied, thoroughly unimpressed. “Picking that fight did. It’s not about the knives, it’s about your making the choice to face them for everyone.”

“Did I shoot that watchman for pleasure, then, Abrascal?” Song darkly laughed. “You bring consequences aplenty.”

“I did not choose to have that bounty put on my head,” he snarled. “Are we going to start counting enemies as our own doing, Song? Because as bad as mine have been, at least I don’t count one of our professors among them.”

Hands clenched into fists, red faces. It was getting out of hand.

“This helps nothing,” Maryam said.

“Fitting,” Tredegar laughed, “that you would speak those words.”

“Would you stop?” Maryam hissed. “How are we even supposed to work as a brigade after this?”

The noblewoman scoffed.

“Have we been?” she asked. “I thought so, but it seems I have been thoroughly deceived.”

Angharad Tredegar breathed in.

“I’d told myself I would not be taken in by smiling liars again,” she said. “It is too late not to be fooled, but at least I can refrain from continuing in that mistake.”

And just like that, she turned and walked away. Maryam watched, genuinely taken aback, as the Pereduri made for the door. She picked up her cloak, her saber and her pistol, and without so much as a glance back she walked out into the night. The three of them stared at that open door in surprised silence, until Song let out a bitter laugh.

“Well, you finally got your way,” she said. “She is gone and you are left.”

And before Maryam could answer, the Tianxi angrily picked up the iron pot and threw it at the wall with a shout of rage. It dented, spilling tea everywhere, and Song swept up the stairs. The Izvorica stood there, digesting that last barb, and passed a hand across her face. She could feel Tristan standing there, unsure what to do.

“I will be heading to the chapterhouse tonight,” Maryam said. “The only way I will be getting a wink of sleep is in a Meadow.”

“I can go with-”

“No,” she replied, opening her eyes just in time to see him smooth his expression. “I need time alone, Tristan.”

He nodded.

“Of course.”

Maryam forced herself not to notice the look in his eyes when she spoke the words.

She could decide in the morning who it was she was angriest with.

# Chapter 22

To say that the Skiritai students were allowed to choose the creatures they would fight would not be entirely correct.

A worn leather booklet filled with scribbles in what was suspected to be Marshal de la Tavarin’s own handwriting had been provided to the class, and in that overly loopy handwriting were outlined three lists of lemures. The Marshal said that Watch teratologists ranked the dangers of the creatures on a scale of one to ten but that he found this to be lacking flair so instead he would provide them with a different one: flint, iron and steel.

The Flint list was for ‘disappointments in the making’. It appeared to be lesser lemures and even some of the most dangerous breeds of lares, some of them needing to be kept in packs to represent a threat to well-trained and well-armed students. The Iron list, he claimed, represented the caliber of opponents they were most likely to end up facing out in Vesper. The lower end was along the lines of a pack of lupines while a nemean – the lion creature Angharad’s band had faced on the first day – was in the upper end.

“The Steel list is for those of you headed for either history books or an early grave,” the Marshal then cheerfully added. “Sometimes both!”

The rules were thus: once a week, every student must be part of a band of no more than four that faced creatures down on the grounds of the Acallar. Groups were allowed to choose an opponent from whichever list they preferred. Those who fought in Flint and Iron would draw a slip of paper from the Marshal’s hat to find out what they fought, but those who fought in Steel were allowed to choose from that list directly. And unlike the others the lemures in the Steel list would not be replaced as the year went on, making every victory a lasting feat.   

On firstday a band of four tried to make a splash by slaying a muchakabeta, a massive snake with six horns and an upper body that was troublingly like a man’s. The creature wielded blades made of bones and had been agreed on by many to be the weakest of the Steel list.

It killed half the band before thirty breaths had passed.

Only volleys of musket fire by the watchmen were able to drive it back into its cage long enough for the Marshal to lock it in again. No one had since dared to try the Steel list, and Angharad’s band was to be no exception. They had chosen Iron instead of Flint but waited until secondday to step forward so they could practice two formations: one for attack and one for defense. They were the first to draw from the Marshal’s hat today, though the name proved unfamiliar to all.

“Monos picudos,” Angharad muttered as they strode across the grounds.

“Beaked monkeys,” Shalini helpfully provided.           

That the breed sounded more humorous than dangerous was no reason to let her guard down. The Watch would not have bothered capturing them if they were not in some way perilous, much less the Marshal placed them in the Iron list.

“Beaks could mean birdlike,” Expendable said, eyes on the ground as he followed.

Honesty compelled Angharad to admit she had not wanted to keep the man – whose true name was Velaphi, though he insisted on being called Expendable – as part of their band. Shalini, however, had strongly argued for it. The Pereduri had her suspicions as to why.

Shalini Goel’s contract had a treacherous price, so sympathy for a man who appeared to have it even worse was not altogether surprising. The Someshwari had a kind streak as well as a ruthless one. Angharad might yet have opposed the arrangement, if their last companion had not tacitly acquiesced when the matter was brought up.

“Hope not,” Salvador grunted. “Flyers are tricky.”

The quiet Sacromontan was eyeing the cage the Marshal stood by warily, and not without reason. Wings alone were a reason to be bumped up to from Flint to Iron, in Angharad’s opinion. She had not thought so at first, but seeing Muchen He’s band struggle against a flock of dog-sized birds with human faces last afternoon had driven home how difficult dealing with such mobility could be. Those creatures had only been passingly clever but they still had taken nearly an hour and several flesh wounds to deal with.

Best to make certain. She reached in and

/the door blew open, a flock of five creatures bursting out as they screeched. Beaks and feathers, but also fur and a tail. Shalini’s shots downed one but the rest scattered and/

she breathed out. It would be a headache if the lemures were allowed to scatter.

“Let us take the spear formation,” Angharad said. “It is best we thin the herd from the start regardless of whether they are winged.”

“Fair enough,” Shalini shrugged.

Salvador nodded his assent, and if Expendable had an objection he kept it to himself. They moved into place, if not smoothly then with purpose. Angharad and Salvador hid themselves on the right side of the cage, sword in hand, while Shalini loaded her entire set of pistols and Expendable spun about his spear to loosen his muscles. It was the Someshwari who was the key to the formation, so it was she that called on the Marshal to open the cage. There was the sound of iron being pulled, and then just like in Angharad’s glimpse the door blew open.

One shot, two, three – so quickly succeeding she could barely tell them apart – and then the Pereduri charged out with Salvador at her heels.

The creatures were worse now that she saw them properly. None smaller than a dog, brightly colored in red and blue with a vaguely simian leathery face ending in a sharp beak. The neck was more fur than feathers, as was the red tail sprouting from their bottoms. Shalini had caught two with her shots, one dead and the other writhing, but Angharad did not pause to finish the lemure off. Salvador, on her heel, would take care of it.

Instead she went on the attack.

The beaked monkeys were fresh out and their eyes were on Shalini, baited by her contract price, which let her cut the first down in complete surprise – downwards blow, right between the wing and the shoulder. She angled her wrist even as there was a wet crunch, bone and flesh parting beneath her saber stroke, and when she ripped free her blade the lemure’s stinking innards came spilling out. She struck out again, but the monsters were nimble. One ducked low, then took flight, and the other landed to scuttle away on what she realized were clawed monkey’s paws.

A gurgle behind her, Salvador cleaning up the loose end.

She ignored the one flown off and chased after the one on the ground, lengthening her stride but to little avail: the creature was fast. Once it was more than twenty feet ahead it turned, screeching mockingly as it waved its feathered buttocks her way, and – its head turned to red pulp, Shalini’s fourth shot finding its mark. Angharad turned in time to see the last lemure, whipped into a frenzy by the gunslinger’s contract, dive down at her from above. Expendable’s spear missed it by a hair, the lemure chattering a laugh, but then the Malani snatched it out of the air barehanded.

She chose not to look at Expendable smashing it against the stone violently even though she could hear the screeching. Or to notice his limbs had been convulsing, the monster sealed inside him aching to get out and spill blood.

Marshal de la Tavarin only strolled back into view after the last of the screeching abruptly cut out, looking somewhat irritated.

“That was staggeringly boring to watch,” he said. “Let us hope that next week reserves a greater challenge – a good blade dulls when used to cut grass.”

Angharad flicked the blood off her blade and nodded in acknowledgement.

“Let us hope,” she agreed.

He squinted at her.

“Tempted as I am to sprout a second on you immediately, I suppose it is yet early in the year,” the Marshal said. “Go on, then, and send down the next band.”

They assembled before moving towards the exit, some relieved chatter blooming as they all politely pretended not to notice there was a feather on the corner of Expendable’s lips. Surely he had not eaten the… would it even possible, with a man’s teeth? It was not as if the beaked monkey had come cooked and sauced.

“-cision, Angharad,” Shalini was saying. “Those things looked a lot clever than the birds Muchen got, it would have been tricky if they scattered.”

Angharad cleared her throat, mildly shamed she had not been listening.

“It felt like the correct decision at the time,” she said.

“It was,” Salvador rasped. “Good instincts.”

Not instincts at all, and she felt like a heel for cheating even as she enjoyed the compliment. The conversation broke up when they took the stairs, emerging back onto the balcony where the students waited until the fights were done for the day. As usual the large space was barely used, scattered cliques of students nesting in their own corner even as more sat near the balcony’s edge for a better look at the violence. Their arrival got a few friendly waves, but no cheers as some of the fights in the past had.

Theirs had, Angharad would admit, not been exciting enough to warrant such a thing.

Yet it was proving sufficient to warrant something else: lounging by the head of the stairs like a panther at rest, an impeccably dressed Lord Musa Shange was waiting. He pushed himself up at the sight of them, stretching in a way that drew the eye to his admittedly muscled arms. Everything the man did was a performance.

“What do you want?” Shalini called out.

A tad rudely, but Lord Musa had earned little courtesy from the Thirty-First.

“A private conversation,” the man replied, then nodded at her. “Lady Angharad.”

“Lord Musa,” she coolly replied.

“Like that’s going to be-” Shalini began, but Angharad gently laid a hand on her arm.

“I can speak for myself,” she said.

Gently still, despite the presumption. Her friend spoke from care, and Angharad owed Shalini and the rest of the Thirty-First Brigade a great deal. She had relied on their kindness for many things since moving out of the cottage.

“We will not be leaving the open,” she informed Musa.

It had his face tightening, but he did not argue. How could he, when his own captain was a known robber? She gave a reassuring nod to the rest of her companions and followed the Malani up a few rungs of benches, far enough they could not easily be overhead. Once they were there, however, the man looked hesitant.

“What can I for you, Lord Musa?” Angharad asked.

Only marginally more polite than what Shalini had said, but he had little courtesy from her either.

“It has been pointed out to me,” Musa stiffly replied, “that the discord between us might be needless.”

Her brow rose but she said nothing. The Pereduri had no intention of apologizing for stepping in when he sought to force Zenzele into a duel. And while mention of that fact had been largely a pretext at the time, it remained true that the false Yaretzi that’d attempted to kill her had received Sandile coin. Not for her own death, but the connection remained.

“I spoke to you impolitely without good reason,” Lord Musa admitted. “In my eagerness to avenge the insult done my cousin, I myself gave insult. I would withdraw my words from that evening, if you will allow.”

Angharad hid her surprise. Withdrawing one’s words commonly served as an apology among Malani highborn, as it avoided acknowledging fault outright while expressing a desire to restore relations to where they stood before the words were spoken. She had never thought much of the practice. Apologies should be given when one overstepped: that giving it marred your honor was the very point, not an unfortunate coincidence. If a noblewoman had committed something worth apology the stain was deserved.

Yet her friends from the Middle Isle had called such an opinion ‘charmingly provincial’, so she was not unaware it was not how Malani saw things. By his standards, Musa was making a genuine effort.

“For the disrespect offered me, I give leave,” Angharad replied after a heartbeat of hesitation.

Which buried personal enmity between them but made it plain she still stood with the Zenzele and Thirty-First. As well she should, Sleeping God. They had been her friends before, but now they were her benefactors as well.

“There is nothing else I would withdraw,” Lord Musa flatly replied.

She could respect that. Musa had a right to be angry on his cousin’s behalf. By fleeing their betrothal and spurning her so openly, Zenzele had damaged her reputation in the eyes of all her peers. Rumors would follow her for years, all the more considering the Sandile were a great house and the Duma lesser – why would the young man flee such an advantageous match, if nor for some hidden defect on Lady Arafa’s part?

Deep down, Angharad thought Musa more right than wrong. House Duma had done badly by Zenzele, betrothing him without his involvement, assent or even knowledge, but that was no fault of House Sandile’s and their reputation was still scoffed by the affair. But that does not excuse, Angharad coldly thought, the use of assassins. That black mark was not Musa Shange’s however, and he should not be made to answer for it.

“That is your right,” Angharad agreed.

He nodded in acknowledgement, seeming pleased they understood one another.

“As a gesture of good will, I would extend an invitation to dinner,” Musa smiled.

Angharad mastered her face. In Malan, she would have needed to watch her tongue. She did not know much of House Shange, but they appeared well connected and were likely wealthier than the Tredegar. Avoiding causing offense in turning him down would have been paramount. But they were both Watch, now, and in principle neither stood above the other. She could answer frankly, and the thought was so novel she could not help but indulge.

“The intimate company of men holds no appeal to me,” she frankly replied.

Musa politely coughed into his fist, though not so quickly she did not see the ghost of a smile.

“Nor that sort of invitation, Lady Angharad,” he said. “Some of us highborn from the Isles are gathering for a private dinner at the Galleries next fourthday. There was talk of inviting you, and I volunteered to extend the opportunity.”

Likely turning talk into decision by doing so, a further gesture of goodwill. The man seemed serious about making amends.

“It would be my honor,” Angharad said, inclining her head in thanks.

“And ours,” Lord Musa easily replied.

He paused.

“Should you be looking to obtain the services of a tailor, Sebastian knows one familiar with our fashions,” the nobleman said. “He offered to make introductions if you would like.”

It was an effort not to grind her teeth. A man who had robbed her wanted to share a tailor? She would rather attend naked.

“I will keep that in mind.”

Musa’s lips twitched.

“I thought that might be your answer,” the Malani lordling said. “You will find, my lady, that your… temporarily absent belongings await you at the Rainsparrow Hotel. Give the attendant the word and they will be brought to your room.”

Musa half-bowed, which she was surprised enough to return half a heartbeat late.

“Sebastian only had animosity with the Thirteenth Brigade,” he said. “Never Angharad Tredegar herself. You are invited to keep that in mind, going forward.”

And with that he took his leave, stalking away lithely as Angharad was left to watch his back. The noblewoman was no fool, to confuse a thorn being pulled out for a favor being done, but it would have been almost as foolish not to acknowledge that Captain Sebastian was making a gesture. Unprompted, with no one forcing his hand. She knew better than to believe it was out of the goodness of his heart, of course. Angharad had been right in a way: she was being courted.

Only it was as a sword instead of a woman.

—

After a bath and a change of clothes the last thing Angharad wanted was to head back to the streets, but there was no helping it. She had already put off this chore too long.

Not that her lodgings at the Rainsparrow Hostel were worth lingering at. The room was a glorified closet and even going back to fetch her affairs had not managed to make it feel any less empty. It was the bareness of the walls, Angharad felt. No pretense was being made that the room was anything but a place to pass through. Not at all like the cottage, where they had all-

No, better the bare room than the cottage. Bleak as it was, it was no lie. There were things about that night Angharad regretted, but leaving was not one of them. It had done her good, to distance herself from the tumult. Standing in that room it’d felt like there was no choice but to claw back, but that was a mirage. It would be ungrateful for Angharad not return the favors done to her on the Dominion, but she was not some Izcalli serf bound to serve the Thirteenth ‘til death.

She could leave if she wanted to, and after three days away from the others she’d come to believe that she did. Pulling her coat tighter around her neck, Angharad gave the blackcloak in front a nod as she walked out the door. The man had earlier confirmed Lord Musa’s words: the belongings taken from her had been returned and were not awaiting her leisure.

Angharad had yet to decide whether she would accept the gesture.

Port Allazei evenings were cool, kept so by the sea breeze, but the streets were still full of cloaked silhouettes. As one of the three main streets outlining the Triangle, Hostel Street was still thick with garrison men and students even though the hour approached six. Mere moments after passing the door Angharad was waved at by an acquaintance, Captain Philani of the Thirty-Eighth, and she slowed her stride to talk with the amiable Malani.

Small talk – the Thirty-Eight did not have a Skiritai, he was curious about the class – but he did have a question.

“Will you be at Dregs tonight?” the captain asked. “Most of my brigade will be, I thought to make introductions.”

“I believe so,” Angharad replied. “Ferranda has been trying to convince me their fish pie is edible, I suppose I ought to try it.”

‘Dreg’s Draughts’ was a tavern by the docks, whose sign had swiftly been vandalized to be boasting of ‘Dregs’ instead. The owners, far from insulted, had embraced the name. Though their ale was almost insultingly terrible it was also cheap and plentiful, which meant about a third of the Scholomance roster went through those doors any given night.

“Lierganen cooking,” Philani agreed, rolling his eyes. “It almost feels a lie to speak the words.”

Angharad smothered a grin.

“They make fine hams,” she loyally replied.

They parted in amusement. Barely two street corners later she ran into Captain Nenetl of the Third, in conversation with two others, but the Izcalli called out to her and made introductions.

“Izel Coyac, meet Angharad Tredegar,” she said.

Izcalli, she thought from the name. A tall, strong-shouldered man who seemed hairless even by the standards of Aztlan stock. He nodded a greeting, which she returned.

“And-”

A heartbeat into the introduction, Angharad placed the other face. It had seemed familiar.

“Kiran Agrawal?” she interrupted.

The Someswhari looked surprised, pleasantly so.

“Indeed,” he said.

Angharad smiled at him, then offered Nenetl explanation.

“We are both Skiritai,” she said. “His band faced some sort of bull lemure last week and I was impressed by his spearwork.”

“My thanks,” the man replied, faintly accented. “Your swordwork is superb, as I am sure you know.”

“Oh, please do not let this turn into another blade flattery session,” Captain Nenetl sighed.

She laughingly solicited Izel’s support in changing the subject – he was a Tinker, it seemed, though Angharad believed those calluses on his hand also from training – and the conversation did not long last after courtesies. Both belonged to the Nineteenth Brigade, she learned, and in truth shared classes with Angharad. Their brigades had simply never formally met.

That last part put a shadow to Angharad’s smile, driving her to end the chat early. What was it that had kept the Nineteenth away from them – Song’s name, the enemies Tristan brought or just another of the hundred black marks on the Thirteenth Brigade that she had never cared to notice? She had been so blind.

A mere three evenings with the Thirty-First had been enough to open her eyes. Their brigade was split between two small houses near the western edge of the Triangle, Rong and Zenzele sharing one while Shalini and Ferranda shared the other. The only appropriate arrangement: Zenzele was a young widower, or close enough. For him to live with two unattached women would have been scandalous. Angharad had supped at the former and twice accompanied them to Dregs, and the difference had been…

Sleeping God, she had missed society. The cottage was so insular, far from everything. There was intimacy in that, but also a certain staleness. To be able to go out in company without concern about Song’s name or Maryam’s paleness had been a breath of fresh air. She had spoken to more of her fellow students in the last four days than she had since making shore in Port Allazei.

 It felt like she had been let out of a prison cell.

Even the simple exercise of finishing the Saga readings with the Thirty-First on firstdday, sharing a table with them at the Crocodilian, had been refreshingly painless. Ferranda’s cabal was not frictionless, with Rong often growing irritated at Shalini for her blitheness while Lord Zenzele struggled with giving his opinions in ways that did not step on his captain’s toes, but the stakes were so low. No one was struggling against crushing burdens, set fire to houses or report being run out of their own covenant.

They had read the assigned readings of their professors, shared a pitcher of bad cider and broken early for a meal. No one died or wept in the process.

The rest of the way to her destination was not far. She left Hostel Street for Regnant Avenue, then followed it south towards the garrison barracks. There were clusters of small courtyards there, abandoned, that were sometimes used for students for sparring and practice. The house she was looking for had been well described to her, and the red awning stood out enough there was no mistaking it. She dragged her feet the rest of the way to the open doors, hearing the sounds of a scuffle inside.

Part of Angharad wanted to find an excuse not to cross that threshold, but that was weakness. She had already used the move and her changed circumstances as an excuse for too long. Evening out her expression, the noblewoman breathed in and passed through the open gates of the courtyard.

The inside was worn but still in fine enough state, a broad sparring yard with an upper gallery surrounding it. Weapons racks had long collapsed into scrap, but someone had recently nailed spikes into the stone wall to hang a few practice weapons. Some of them were being used as she watched: Tupoc Xical, a dull axe and dagger in hand, was dancing around that Tianxi girl from his cabal with the burns and the milky eye. She wielded a long spear, the bread and butter of the republican militias, and the reach should have given the Izcalli trouble.

Instead he was toying with her, catching the shaft with his axe or dagger before darting in for killing strokes – never harder than a tap – and giving grounds to begin again. It took Angharad two passes of watching the girl grow increasingly angry and sweaty as she failed to land blows to realize what Tupoc was doing. He was trying to break her drilling habit and teach her distance as used in duels instead of the march-and-thrust the Republics demanded of their infantry.

After the third pass Acceptable Losses, as she recalled to be the Tianxi’s sobriquet, looked angry enough to snap her own spear.

“You are too much better at this,” she said. “There is no point-”

“There is no point in you thrusting at where I am,” Tupoc interrupted. “You need to thrust where I am going to be.”

She looked inclined to argue, but he raised an eyebrow over those pale eyes and the Tianxi sighed. Only then did she spare a glance for Angharad, who was yet standing by the gates, and sneered before walking off. There was a small door beneath the galleries that Angharad had earlier missed.

“Angharad Tredegar,” Tupoc greeted her. “I had begun to wonder if you would ever come to collect.”

“I merely had other affairs to settle,” Angharad replied.

“Yes, moving back into the Rainsparrow,” the man mused. “I heard.”

Angharad said nothing, knowing that to give him any thread to tug at would be a mistake. After a moment, the man chuckled. He gestured at the training weapons against the wall.

“Care for a spar?” he asked.

“No,” she flatly replied. “I came for-”

“Did you know,” Tupoc lightly interrupted, “that there are now only sixty-eight cabals left?”

Angharad frowned.

“I do not recall how many there were before,” she admitted.

She thought Song might have mentioned it in passing, but she had not committed the number to memory.

“Seventy-two when classes began,” he told her. “One collapsed from their Stripe being tossed out of Scholomance, but nothing so near for the others.”

“Deaths?” she asked with a frown.

There were now eight dead Skiritai students, though this Lady Knit ruling the hospital seemed able to cure much anything short of death. She had heard rumors of more deaths from Port Allazei and even one student taken by Scholomance, but nothing she would dare to call a fact.

“Arguments,” Tupoc replied. “And poaching. The first deaths made holes in brigades, whose captains recruited to fill. The brigades being recruited from in turn had to poach, and down the ladder it went.”

“Until the bottom rung,” Angharad said, cocking her head to the side. “Those collapsed.”

He nodded.

“And became spare parts for brigades to pick from,” he said. “At the turn of the month, there will be a lot of desperate sorts willing to do anything so a cabal takes them in.”

“A warning, Tupoc?” she challenged.

He grinned.

“I merely worry of the Thirteenth’s health,” he piously said. “First you move out of their secret hideaway, then most of you cease talking in public? Your pet rat even stopped coming to class.”

Angharad’s teeth grit. Tristan had been absent today and the day before, though she had been assured he still lived.

“Why would you care even if there were trouble?” Angharad snorted.

“Why, Tredegar, we are all old friends,” Tupoc said. “How could I not worry about dear bosom companions like you, Song or Maryam?”

“I only barely consider you an acquaintance,” she coldly replied.

He was, unfortunately, only enthused by her words. What little patience she’d come here with began to thin.

“I did not come here to entertain you,” Angharad said. “You promised me answers, Tupoc. Deliver.”

He leaned his axe back against his shoulder, then hummed.

“I was in the thick of it, that night,” he said. “Much like you.”

She nodded.

“I recall.”

He had been one those meeting the cultists with steel instead of blackpowder, keeping the raiders at bay.

“I do not believe any of you grasped how close-run that skirmish was,” Tupoc mused. “If not for the muskets on the stairs, we would have faced the full warband and been swept up. If not for our fighting line proving so fierce, a few of their warriors could have toppled our firing line in moments.”

He paused.

“Hollows well versed in fighting soldiers know better than to assault a dug-in position,” the Izcalli continued. “Given the fine cover a dark forest makes, I was concerned that their captain would send a few warriors to swing around and strike at our musketmen.”

“So you kept an eye on behind us,” Angharad put together.

“As much as the fighting allowed,” Tupoc said. “I did not see who shot Isabel Ruesta, Tredegar, but from the way she fell to the ground I can tell you who did not: the cult of the Red Eye.”

She breathed in sharply.

“You are certain?” she pressed.

“She was facing the tower when she was shot,” Tupoc said.

And the musket ball had struck the front of her face, not the back of the head. Angharad had thought her spun around by the shot. She closed her eyes. Who had been up there? Cozme and Tupoc had been in the thick of it with her. Who did that leave? Brun, who had been enamored with killing and closest to the corpse. He did not have a musket, only a pistol. Lan, who Angharad had never seen use a weapon. Shalini, who had only used pistols as well. And then their two sharpshooters: Ferranda Villazur and Song Ren.

Angharad could still remember the last heartbeat of that fight: a shot from the woods, and then one from the near the tower. Where Ferranda and Song had stood.

“Either Villazur or your dearest captain,” Tupoc said, echoing her thoughts. “That is my best guess.”

“And you said nothing?” she curtly replied.

He shrugged.

“I thought I might need that little tidbit if either of them tried to get me hanged,” he replied. “It was best kept under wraps until I could make use of it, and now I have.”

“Would you testify to this?” she asked.

He burst out laughing. It took an obnoxious, teeth-gritting full minute until he ran out.

“Oh gods,” Tupoc breathed out. “That just made my week.”

“This is not laughing matter,” she said.

“It is,” the Izcalli replied. “All that takes place on the Dominion falls under amnesty, remember? Even if Ferranda confessed to a Watch tribunal tomorrow the words would not earn her so much as a slap on the wrist.”

Much as she would have liked to punch that grin off his face, he was unpleasantly correct. As far as the Watch and its laws were concerned, the Dominion was a done thing. Without another word, Angharad turned and walked out. Tupoc had not given her sufficient reason to insult him, only for lesser rudeness of this sort. She ignored his taunting calls, fingers still bunched up into fists.

It was not proof, but it was not nothing. And it made one thing all the clearer.

Angharad need to sit down with Song Ren to tell her that when the month ended, she would be leaving the Thirteenth Brigade.

Professor Sasan was in fine form for the lecture, which lasted four hours with a small break for students to use the latrines.

The question he had posed last class about the name of the period preceding the beginnings of the First Empire – the Nix, Song learned – turned into a spirited discussion about the limitations of historical knowledge and the questions they begged. The origin of hollows, for example. It was known that there had been hollows by the time of the First Empire, but the Antediluvians who built it were believed to have come from the Old World above. Had there been hollows before they came?

Were hollows, in a sense, the natural inhabitants of Vesper?

That proposition earned offended anger and gadfly delight in equal measure, with the professor serving more as an arbiter of discussion – demanding sources, commenting on their credibility – than as the one leading it. After the break the teaching was more traditional, focusing on the founding and nature of the First Empire. Though its spoken languages were long forgotten and the written works only barely deciphered, Song was surprised to learn there were yet traces of the former.  Several of the hollow cants in the Trebian Sea were believed to be descended from Antediluvian tongues.

It was the sort of class Song would have greatly enjoyed, were she of a mind to enjoy anything at all.

Three days. It had been three days since she swung her tantrum around like a sledgehammer to methodically destroy everything she had attempted to accomplish since setting foot on Tolomontera. She had been floundering ever since.

Angharad returned once to the cottage only to fetch her belongings, careful to come when everyone else was certain to be absent. Maryam stopped staying at the Meadow after the second night, but she came back only to sleep and left before breakfast. Tristan, meanwhile, was no longer showing up to class and the only reason Song knew him to be alive was because he had left a note mentioning he was ‘tracking something down’ and food regularly disappeared.

He’d not bothered to write a second or a third note, only tracing an additional X at the bottom of the same paper with each passing day to reiterate he still drew breath.

Three days, and though opportunities had been thin on the ground Song had seen some of them pass by before her. She could have attempted to force a conversation with Maryam in those twenty seconds every morning she saw the other girl before she left the cottage, or requested that Angharad have tea with her politely enough the noblewoman would have found it difficult to refuse. Gods, she could even have headed to the Chimerical to try and corner Tristan while he worked there.

She had not. None of it.

“- three hundred words on why we still call the First Empire an empire even though it was, according to every primary source, an oligarchy,” Professor Sasan said. “I’ll be collecting at the beginning of class.”

A pause.

“It should go without saying, but the hallway full of emerald-encrusted gold sculptures that opened to the side of this lecture hall is a trap,” he added. “If any of you are foolish enough to be tricked by Scholomance putting in such lackluster effort, I will be marking down the rest of your cabal for the assignment instead of giving pity points.”

There was some laughter and after pushing up his spectacles with a smile the professor dismissed the class. Song steeled herself, turned to her left, but before she could so much as open her mouth Angharad was on her feet and walking away. She waded into the fray of departing students.

So much for that.

The Pereduri would not be leaving wandering the hallways alone, at least. Song glanced back at the cabal sitting behind them, finding that Ferranda was avoiding her gaze again. Though amicable the two of them were no more than acquaintances, so they both knew that the other captain would absolutely rope in Angharad if she could. She was certainly making the effort.

Yet how could Song be angry with that courting, when Angharad needed the help and all these troubles were of Song’s making in the first place? Besides, there were other amends that the Tianxi needed to make. She turned to Maryam, who was still putting away her books and papers.

“Do you have a moment?” she quietly asked.

Blue eyes flicked up to her.

“No,” Maryam said. “Captain Yue expects me at the Abbey within half an hour, I’ll be pressed as is.”

“Later tonight, then,” she said.

The Izvorica shrugged.

“You know where I sleep,” she replied, promising nothing.

The bag was hoisted over her shoulder, and with a nod she walked away. Song kept her face calm. It was only overweening pride that made it feel like a dismissal. And perhaps if she had been quicker to approach Maryam, there would not be such… distance between them. She forced herself to keep her mind on putting away her things, and succeeded enough that she did not hear the other’s approach.

“Captain Song, a word.”

Her hand discreetly inched towards the grip of her sword even as she turned and fixed a friendly smile on her face. Ramona of the Forty-Ninth Brigade, it must be said, looked like she could handle herself in a fight. Short hair, a knife scar across the nose and scrapper’s build that was all sinews instead of bulging. The smile the blonde was sporting looked off on her face, like a hound putting on a hat so it might sit at the dinner table.

“Ramona,” Song greeted her with a nod, then raised an eyebrow. “Or perhapsCaptain Ramona, now?”

The smile grew slightly more honest and significantly sharper.

“For two days now,” Captain Ramona confirmed. “I would have sought you out earlier, but my house needed to be put in order.”

“Congratulations,” Song replied, largely meaning it.

Tengfei Pan had seemed the driving influence behind the Forty-Ninth’s pursuit of the bounty on Tristan’s head, so she had been holding out hope a change of leadership might make them reconsider. It was only hope, however, so Song hooked her thumb in her belt – coincidentally not far from her sword. A glance behind Ramona told her the rest of the brigade was lingering close. Her look was noticed.

“A conversation between us is overdue,” Captain Ramona said, “but I am not unaware there has been bad blood between our brigades.”

Deftly she unsheathed the thick blade at her hip and set it down on the table, a worn pistol joining it a heartbeat later.

“This is not a trap,” the blonde said. “I offer to walk with you unarmed, letting you choose the destination, and instructed my cabalists to hold back for five minutes before leaving the lecture hall.”

Song’s eyes narrowed. Huang Pan, the round Tianxi with the contract that discerned whether an object or individual was situated in one of the cardinal directions, still had all his daily uses left. But it would be difficult to follow us using that alone, Song decided. There was a reason they had used it to ambush Tristan and not chase him. It was, in the end, not all that precise a tool.

“Let us talk, then,” Song nodded. “Come.”

She put a spring to her step, noting that the Malani girl from the Forty-Ninth went to pick up the abandoned weapons as the two of them headed into the halls. Neither so much as glanced into the trap hall to their left, instead stepping past a triad of chattering Izcalli and making enough room no one was close enough to easily overhear. Song slowed her steps then, but only slightly. She would not make it easy for the Forty-Ninth to catch up.

“This will serve,” she told Ramona as they continued their walk.

They were still heading for the front gates, but they had time enough for a short talk before reaching them and the spikes in the ground provided some modicum of safety.

“Truce,” Captain Ramona bluntly offered. “Our patron wants all of your heads on a pike, but we’re not here to indulge whatever pissing match she has going on with your own brigade’s patron.”

“It was not them that began this conflict,” Song said.

“No, it was us trying to cash in on that bounty,” the other woman acknowledged. “And because we tried, Fara can’t taste salt anymore.”

Song blinked, trying to hide her confusion. Not well enough.

“That’s how Lady Knit works,” Ramona explained. “She takes something from you, to knit you back together like you were.”

No wonder the Malani girl looked like she was not sure whether she wanted to slit Tristan’s throat or flinch away from him. She had lost much but must fear losing even more in avenging herself of it.

“Interesting,” Song simply said.

Best to let Ramona keep talking. The best terms were had when you let the other side negotiate with itself.

“A truce is what I offer, for a start,” Ramona repeated. “It occurs to me we’ve been going at this all wrong.”

The Tianxi only inclined her head in agreement, the other woman’s lips tightening in irritation at how little she was being given before she smoothed it away.

“Word is the Thirteenth’s been having a rough patch,” she said.

“Rumors are fickle things,” Song replied.

“They are,” Ramona said. “But it’s public record what bounties people take from the board in the Galleries, and I asked my patron about what these trials are like.”

She shrugged.

“Nasty pieces of work one and all, she said,” the blonde said. “Seems to me like you got a little too eager to make up for your blunder and the Thirteenth took one in the gut for it. It got you up to third place, sure, but you’re on shaky grounds at home for it.”

Song’s jaw clenched. She would be tied for second, if not for the point she had lost on the first day. Captain Vivek of the First Brigade had lapped both her and Sebastian Camaron by clearing two lesser assignments in quick succession, a bold advance that had allegedly sent one of his cabalists into Lady Knit’s care for a night.

“As I said,” Song replied, “rumors are fickle things.”

“I’m not blind,” Captain Ramona bluntly replied. “Your pale girl looks like she’s ready to chew wood and the Malani swordmistress barely talks anymore. Abrascal’s gone with the wind.”

“Covenant work,” Song said, affecting a shrug.

It might even be true.

“Either way, he’s a bad look for you,” Ramona said. “And if the way your Thirteenth slapped us around taught me anything, it’s that a brigade will tighten up at the first gut punch but it can only take so many of those before that anger’s turned inwards.”

Song breathed in sharply, stung. That was truer than the other woman knew.

“Tengfei saw you as someone to bury for that, the source of all his troubles,” the blonde said. “That was short-sighted of him. See, Song, I think you and I are in the same boat.”

The Tianxi frowned.

“Is that so?”

Captain Ramona chuckled.

“My captaincy’s shaky,” she said. “I got the seat because Tengfei blundered, but if I can’t deliver success then the same votes that got him in charge in the first place will turn back. But yours is just as shaky, eh? Too many gut punches. You need a win, same as me.”

“So you offer a truce,” Song said.

It was hardly anything to boast about.

“That’s the loud part,” Ramona said. “The quiet is that we’ll write off the gold you stole and tell you where the Ninth stashed all the stuff they took from you.”

And there was the offered victory, presumably. Admittedly a tempting one. Retrieving their affairs might even go some way in mending bridges with Angharad, considering how incensed she had been at the thefts. Only one detail was yet missing.

“And what would your win be, Ramona?” she asked.

“I do what Tengfei couldn’t,” the blonde replied. “Abrascal’s dead weight for you now anyway, rope around your neck. Just give me a time and place and I’ll rid you of your trouble – and cut you in for a third of the bounty on top of it.”

For a second, Song blanked in utter surprise. Why would she – no, it only made sense. She had not hidden her dislike of the thief all that deeply, and now he was flouting her authority by abstaining from classes barely a week into the year. By appearance, Song had every reason to want to be rid of him. Why wouldn’t she trade the thief for victories that would make up for her debacles, a flush of gold and the knowledge that his enemies would hound the Thirteenth no more?

“A third,” Song slowly repeated, to keep from showing any of her thoughts,

Ramona grinned like someone whose bet had paid off. Song, for an idle moment, considered unslinging her pistol and shooting her in the stomach. How satisfying that would be.

“Don’t be greedy now,” Ramona chided. “Tell you what, to sweeten the deal I’ll even throw in introductions to a Savant who’s looking to jump ship. I noticed your lot don’t have a scholar to handle the classwork.”

“Maintaining numbers would be a concern, after losing a cabalist,” Song acknowledged.

She kept her tone even, giving away nothing. The other woman studied her, dark eyes narrowed.

“I can tell you’re not quite sold,” Captain Ramona said. “Fair enough. I’ll admit the risks are worse for you if it goes badly.”

She shrugged.

“But it’s a good offer and I think deep down you know it,” the Lierganen said. “I’ll let you sit on a while. You can come back to me once you’ve worked it all out to your satisfaction.”

Song chose not to finish the rest of the walk to the gates in Captain Ramona’s company.

—

The Academy class was worse than Saga had been, in some ways.

What Colonel Cao was teaching them was objectively important. Supply requests were one of the responsibilities of captains and every brigade would have to make them when they took their end of the year test, meaning this was practical knowledge she was being given. Even more so when the colonel took them time to lay out how to get around any obstructionist quartermasters one might chance to encounter or be able to draw on the strategic reserves of Watch fortresses when the ‘spare’ stocks were already spent.

Yet while Song’s reed pen scratched against paper, her mind kept drifting. It was thoroughly frustrating to catch herself losing focus again and again, until the frustration itself became the distraction. Worse, her eyes kept drifting to the slate hung up on the wall and the names it displayed.

VIVEK LAHIRI – 5

SEBASTIAN CAMARON – 4

SONG REN – 3

All of this, she could not help but think, for third place. There were dozens beneath her and even more that’d never made it onto the board, but what did that matter? It was not them she had believed herself to be triumphing over. It was a relief when class ended after a mere two hours, Colonel Cao releasing them with a warning that at week’s end the first evaluation would begin. She did not elaborate on the nature of it in the slightest, which drew out interested whispers.

Song would have fled the Galleries, but she was intercepted on her way out and when the likes of Captain Nenetl Chapul made an invitation she was in no position to refuse.

It was not a long walk down to the salons. The captain of the Third Brigade had not approached her before, as was only to be expected of a woman leading one of the largest alliances in their year. Song had been careful about not approaching her instead, for making such ties would make her a pawn in the grudge match between Captain Nenetl and Sebastian Camaron. That was reason enough to be wary when the round-cheeked Aztlan invited her for a spot of tea in the nicest salon.

Her contract, Song mused as she sat down across the table, was intriguingly complex.

The easiest way to describe it would be that Nenetl held absolute awareness of herself. The Aztlan girl ‘knew’ everything about her body and mind in that unqualified way that only gods could provide. Nenetl  would know she caught a cold the moment the sickness settled in her, know terror was being pushed into her mind even as it affected her thoughts or when exercise was doing more good than harm to her body.

That contract would even make her a fine shot: she would know everything wrong about her stance.

The price was a sort of controlled mania, emerging compulsions to do a single action seventy-seven times in a row that would get harder to fight off the longer she had them. Her contract was in Antigua, so odds were good seventy-seven was a number sacred to her god. Ritual prayer ensured by contract, more or less, which Song had noticed to be a favored price of older gods whose influence waned. The younger, reckless ones instead glutted on concepts they liked like children eating all the sweet rice balls on the plate.

Nenetl poured for the both of them, the fragrant scent of Shouxing red leaves wafting up to Song’s nose. She breathed it in with a sigh, not bothering to hide her pleasure. They took the first sip together, as was proper, but the Tianxi noted that Nenetl’s hand waited no time in reaching for the startlingly large plate of spice cookies she had ordered along with the tea. The two of them made small talk for a few minutes, discussing the oddness in having rain scheduled every seventhday and how the cabal-based half of Warfare class promised to be interesting.

It was Captain Nenetl who eventually cut to the chase.

“I have come across information,” she said, “that might be of interest to you.”

“Might?”

“The uncertainty is only in the degree, in truth,” Nenetl said. “I learned where the Ninth keeps your belongings.”

Song kept her face smooth. That made twice someone was trying to sell her the information. Ferranda was convinced the hatred between Nenetl and Sebastian Camaron was genuine, so it should not be a trick in that sense. That did not mean it was not a trick in another.

“And if I were to ask how you obtained that information?”

Nenetl cocked her head to the side.

“You’ve already had an offer,” she deduced. “Likely the same source for the leak. The Savant in the Ninth Brigade gets chatty when plied with fine liquor.”

One of the many reasons Song disliked drunks.

“I am not uninterested,” the Tianxi said. “That is contingent, of course, on the price.”

“Nothing onerous,” the other woman said. “The location is also used by the Ninth as a stash for some contraband. Nothing that would get them more than a slap on the wrist, but goods very much disallowed on the island.”

She paused, breaking off a piece of spice cookie and scarfing it down with great relish.

“All I ask is that, when you retrieve your property, you set the place aflame,” Nenetl said. “It is not situated anywhere a fire might spread, so there would be no issue in that regard.”

Song’s brow raised, visibly unimpressed.

“That would be signing up to be the vanguard in your struggle,” she said.

“Interesting,” Nenetl Chapul said, eyes glinting. “You speak as if you are not at war with Sebastian already.”

“I am not,” she firmly replied.

“I would not be so certain, were I you,” Nenetl said. “In that undisclosed location, Captain Song, you will not find the belongings of Angharad Tredegar. Even as we speak they have been returned to her at the Rainsparrow Hostel.”

Song stilled. Surely the man could not be brazen enough to try to turn robbing a Pereduri peer into recruiting her? No, of course he would be. The payoff alone would make it worth the attempt. If he pulled it off the earlier mark on Captain Sebastian’s reputation would instead become a crowning glory. The man so silver-tongued he made his opponents into cabalists.

It took her a moment to catch on to Nenetl’s angle here, but catch it she did. If the Thirteenth burned that hiding place while Angharad was still – at least nominally – part of the brigade, it closed the door to the Ninth recruiting her. Bringing her in after one slight was turning a misunderstanding into a coup, but after two? That was being a whipping boy. The reputational costs would be too high.

It was a humbling thing, realizing that the only reason the captain of the Third was sitting across from her was to make entirely sure that her enemy would not get his hands on Angharad Tredegar.

“Thank you for the warning,” Song forced herself to reply.

Nenetl inclined her head.

“Think on it, by all means,” she said, rising to her feet. “But remember that time is not on your side.”

However self-interested the favor done to her had been, Song still counted it enough of one to pretend not to notice that the other woman pocketed the last cookies on the plate and she had sipped at her tea exactly once. She stayed there sitting until the tea was cool, eyes closed as she leaned back into the sinfully comfortable chair.

She needed advice.

It made her wince to think of who was left to ask it from.

—

Captain Wen was eating when she found him.

It was a sign of desperation to seek the man out, but what else was left to her? It would take weeks for Uncle Zhuge to answer a letter, assuming luck with ships, and there was simply no one else for Song to speak to. Ferranda was working at odds with her, however gentle the work, and the prospect of asking Colonel Cao advice – and thus needing to explain her blunders – made Song cringe down to the marrow of her bones.

Asking Sergeant Mandisa for directions saw her sent to a small shop close to the docks. There she found Wen Duan chatting with the owner, a middle-aged Izcalli woman with long black hair whose bangs were a straight line. She was giggling quite a bit, and Wen shot Song an irritated look when she entered the shop – though he did not stop nibbling at a bar of that strange almond confection called turron that Lierganen were so fond of.

“Song,” he greeted her. “What do you want?”

Her jaw stiffened.

“A conversation,” she said.

The bespectacled man squinted at her, then sighed and turned to the shopkeeper.

“Another one for the road, if you please,” he said.

“Only half a bar,” she lightly replied. “Else you will have no reason to return.”

“You would be mistaken,” Wen assured her, leaning in with a charming smile. “Terribly mistaken, I assure you.”

That earned him another bout of giggles and even as Song watched the Izcalli hand him a wrapped bar of turron in a way that brushed their fingers she considered that this might just be a new low in her life.

“Stop looking like someone just kicked your chicken,” Wen said when they exited onto the street, still nibbling at his treat. “It’s putting me off my turron.”

“I apologize,” she made herself say.

The corpulent man eyed her through his golden spectacles.

“You must truly be at the end of your rope,” he noted. “You didn’t even look like you were calling me yixin inside your head while you said that.”

Song straightened.

“I would not-”

“Come,” Wen casually interrupted. “We are taking a walk down the shoreline.”

There would be no dissuading the man, she knew, so she grit her teeth and followed. Song was familiar with the docks and a few streets near them, but she had not yet found the time to follow the curve of Port Allazei along the water. Though the docks were fortified and there was another such attempt at walls along the shore when headed east, those stones were crumbling and past a short span entirely absent.

The Watch had not seen the need to rebuild the wall when seizing the city, perhaps judging that no one was inclined to try and take it from them.

Wen kept them moving at a brisk enough pace she was not able to place a word, so eventually she gave up and simply followed him. Her gaze wandered out onto the dark waters, the span of darkness broken up only by the impossibly large rings of the Orrery spinning onwards. It was almost calming the behold, that grand length of emptiness. She was not out of breath when her patron’s steps began to slow, but she felt warm under the coat. Perhaps for the best, given the coolness of the wind coming from the sea.

Captain Wen plopped himself down atop a stone bench facing the sea, unwrapping a new bar of turron. Song had not even noticed him polishing off the last.

“All right,” he said. “Talk.”

“There has been an argument,” Song said as she sat down to his right, then licked her lips. “I argued. With other members of the Thirteenth. It went poorly.”

“You went into the Lugar Vacio,” Wen snorted. “That was bound to scrape everyone’s nerves raw.”

“You know what it is?” she asked.

“I was briefed,” he vaguely replied. “Angharad and Maryam at each other’s throats?”

Song looked down. That had happened, but certainly not been the worst of it.

“You and Tristan, then,” Wen said. “I thought that pot would take a month or two to boil over, I’ll admit. What had you lunging for each other’s throat?”

Song tucked her hands into her sleeves so he would not see her fingers clench. How honest could she truly be with him? Only shallowly, she thought. The man was a Watch loyalist to the bone, he would see it as his duty to-

“Something illegal,” the fat man mused. “Or you would have told me by now.”

Her teeth clenched. It was like her thoughts were an open book.

“One of your escorts went missing during the trip, I heard,” Wen said, tone leading.

Song did not answer, or look anywhere near him. Eventually he sighed.

“If something had happened,” he said. “Would it have been deserved?”

She thought of the ruin of red she had made of the flesh. Of the brutal torment she had condemned the man to by feeding him to an evil god.

“Some if it,” she whispered. “But not all.”

“Something you regret and Tristan was involved,” Wen mused. “A recipe for disaster. The little shit really is misfortune on legs, isn’t he?”

That got a weak smile out of her. Song breathed out shallowly, then told him everything save the damning detail. How there had been a thin layer of peace but it had cracked, how she had clawed at Tristan one time too many and it had all come tumbling out. Maryam turning on her, on Angharad. Angharad turning on all of them. That her brigade had effectively deserted the cottage and how they now all avoided her.

Wen listened to it all, nodding and humming and nibbling at his turron. Song was panting when she’d finished, and her voice felt raw.

“It was only a matter of time,” Wen finally said.

“So it was inevitable?” Song asked, exhausted. “Nothing could be done.”

The man laughed.

“Don’t be a fool,” he said. “Plenty could be done. Just not by you, Song. You don’t have what it takes.”

She breathed in sharply, turning a glare on him.

“Pardon me?” she sharply asked.

“You were always going to fail, Song,” Captain Wen slowly said, as if addressing a child. “I saw that in you the moment you walked into the Old Fort. That loss had been lurking in your veins since you were a child, I’d wager.”

Her jaw clenched, her entire body with it.

“I have been thoroughly prepared for this, Captain Wen,” she said, carefully enunciating every word.

“You might be the single least qualified even inside your own brigade,” Wen mused.

“The least qualified?” Song hissed. “I have been training for this since I could walk. Do you have any idea what that was like? It was being allowed outside only to do spear drills in the courtyard, it was painting characters until my fingers bled and every meal being a formal ceremony.”

Her fingers clenched.

“I learned to speak Umoya before I learned my own mother’s maiden name, Wen,” she snarled. “I was made to pass as a boy so my brother’s sword teacher would condescend to bruise me. The closest I ever came to flying a kite was when I was made to shoot them at target practice.”

The large man, indifferent to her rising voice, bit into his turron and loudly chewed.

“Rough,” he said, after swallowing. “Anyway, while I won’t say it was all useless it had pretty much nothing to do with what you’re trying to accomplish here at Scholomance.”

“I was raised to be a leader,” Song insisted.

“You were raised to do things a leader can do, maybe,” Wen allowed. “Those kites you shot, the servants’ kids made them?”

Hesitantly, she nodded.

“You ever run kites with them?” he asked.

Her jaw clenched as she saw where he was heading. Making her out like some sort of porcelain plate, only taken out for formal meals.

“My family are not fools, Wen,” she bit out. “I was taught to drill guards, to take reports from our servants and balance accounts.”

“You weren’t taught a damn thing,” Wen amiably replied. “All those people you mention answered to the name of Ren, not to you. Generously, I’ll allow you might have learned howto sound like someone others answer to. It’s not nothing, but let’s just say that the legs aren’t the most important part of the bird.”

“Authority-”

“Is earned,” the Tianxi flatly interrupted. “If you were an officer in the regulars, your rank would stand for years of service and training. They’d trust that until they learned to trust you. But here, in this school?”

He snorted.

“What have you done that any of the brats in the Thirteenth should take your advice on so much as scratching their ass, Song?” he asked. “You’re at the same starting line, and you’re captain mostly because you’re a Stripe and no one cared enough to take it from you. Some of them like you, but not a single one of them respects you.”

She grit her teeth, feeling as if she had been slapped. She would not cry, would not give him the pleasure.

“That’s not the end of the world,” Wen said, not unkindly. “That’s what the Stripe classes are for: to bleed out some of the failure in the veins of all you cocksure little shits. In most cabals you would have passed muster and learned the most important lessons over a year or two. The way most of your fellows will.”

He took another bite of turron, practically inhaled it.

“Only you didn’t put together most cabals, you made the Thirteenth,” he said. “You picked three of the most talented, deranged people on the year’s roster then tried to run them like they were your father’s estate guards.”

“Talented?” Song asked, almost plaintively.

“Tredegar shouldn’t need an explanation,” Wen said. “Tristan’s the latest student of the monster under the Krypteia’s bed, a thing that’s been around longer than the Republics have existed at a state.”

He paused.

“Maryam took some digging,” he conceded. “I thought the name on her recommendation might be a coincidence, but it turns out she’s been sent here by Totec the Feathered.”

She did not hide her ignorance.

“You won’t know that name because he’s not famous outside his guild,” Wen told her. “He’s the man the Navigators have spent the last thirty years sending to learn the rites of Gloam practitioners to see if they can be made into proper Signs. If he thinks Maryam has ‘great potential’, I’m not inclined to argue.”

“I had no idea,” she whispered.

“Because you don’t know any of these people,” he said. “’They’re a walking collection of wounds inside the head, which a girl who has never talked to anyone she did not need to either obey or order would have no real idea how to handle. You’re a fish on a mountaintop.”

He took another bite.

“Could be you’ll flop into a pond,” Wen said, chewing. “More likely you’ll choke to death.”

“I can’t let it end that way,” Song bit out. “There as to be some way I can fix this.”

Wen considered her for a long moment, chewing, and finally swallowed.

“Genuine authority flows from the font of trust,” he said, quoting someone. “Men can be bullied or bought, but they will never achieve what they would under someone they believe deserves to hold command over them.”

“And how do I get there?” she pressed.

He laughed.

“Am I the Stripe, or you?” Wen asked. “Figure it out, Song. Or dissolve your brigade and let them go under someone who will.”

He rose, after that, and walked away. Song knew better than to follow him. She stayed there on the bench, looking at the vast expanse of nothing while the wind brushed crumbs onto her coat. All day, she felt, she had been a spectator. Sitting there, watching others walk away from her. No, perhaps not even only today. It must be her hand on the chisel, not circumstance’s, else nothing would be fixed.

Song would begin with the cabalist she could reach.

# Chapter 24

She would have fallen asleep if not for the second pot of tea.

Song sat at the kitchen table in the quivering candlelight, not staring at Tristan’s shoddy note – it had a fresh X added at the bottom, conveying he still drew breath. Now and then she remembered to turn the page of the first volume of Universal Histories, which she was meant to be reading for Saga. Only she kept mixing up pre-imperial kings: even the earliest dynasty, the short-lived Pelayo, had managed to squeeze in two Alfonsos who’d fought battles over the same stretch of riverlands with similarly named rival kings.

At least ancient kings of Cathay had taken on reigning names that made them easier to tell apart.

Song felt the words sliding along her mind instead of sinking in and knew that by morning she would remember hardly a thing of what she had read. Yet to close the book would be to surrender this time to waiting alone, keeping company only with Tristan’s note. Sipping at her increasingly lukewarm tea, Song turned a page and was presented with the tortured family tree of the Ormisenda dynasty – the successors of the Pelayo – and winced at the sight of a fresh battalion of Alfonsos, flanked by a cavalry wing of Fruelas.

“This is unkind,” she informed the book.

The frustration distracted her enough that her stomach dropped when she heard the front door open. Maryam trudged in tiredly with a lantern in hand, not hanging her weapons on the hooks but dropping them into a pile on the wooden bench next to the boots instead. The powder, at least, she hung. The hooded cloak that she wore everywhere was tucked under her arm as she walked out of the antechamber, eyes widening in surprise when she saw Song seated at the table.

The Izvorica must have been exhausted not to notice there was a lit candle in the kitchen. For a long moment they matched gazes, Song’s mouth suddenly gone dry, then Maryam sighed.

“Must we do this tonight?” she asked.

Song straightened.

“Will you promise me time tomorrow morning if not?”

Muttering something in Triglau that had the sound of a curse to it, the pale-skinned woman approached and dropped her cloak on a chair before sitting on another, facing Song. Maryam had always been pale and the Tianxi could not remember her without circles around her eyes but there was something… she looked worn. As if what had once been a few layers now went down to the bone.

“The hours you keep are taking a toll,” Song quietly said.

Maryam’s face closed, like shutters pulled tight, and she knew she had made a mistake again.

“I get enough sleep and Captain Yue sends me back with an escort when we run late,” she sharply replied.

“I meant no offense,” Song hastened to reply.

Gods, she felt like biting her tongue until it bled. Maryam breathed in, waited a moment, then nodded. Stiffly.

“Fine,” she said. “None taken.”

“You are working with the captain, then,” Song tried.

Maryam’s face closed shut again and Song almost let out a sob of frustration. She knew the other woman was not thin-skinned – could not be, when the color of it earned her stares and jeers wherever she went – which meant that Song was walking through a field and somehow managing to step solely on the fucking caltrops.

“Worked on, more like,” Maryam tightly replied. “But I’ve had some answers.”

“Progress, then,” Song said, forcing a smile.

“Of a sort,” the blue-eyed woman flatly replied. “Captain Yue is mostly certain that if a quarter of my brain was amputated my signifying would stabilize.”

Captain Yue sounded like the Krypteia should regularly break into her closet to look for skeletons, but it would not have been politic of Song to say as much.

“Have you-” Song began, but Maryam raised a hand to cut her off.

“Song,” she said. “The only reason my eyes are still open is that it burns when I close them. I am in no state or mood for chatter. What do you want?”

Song had earlier spent the better part of an hour preparing a speech. Even written it down, though naturally she had burned the paper after memorizing it. Only looking at those weary blue eyes, she stumbled.

“It has come to my attention,” she said, facing that stare, then swallowed. “I have-”

She could not remember the end of that sentence if someone put a pistol to her head. The chisel kept slipping through her fingers. Song swallowed, almost choking on her own fear and spit.

“I’m sorry,” Song blurted out. “It was… I was unfair to you and to others. I started the fire and fed it. It is my fault.”

Maryam watched her, pale face gaunt in the light, and the Tianxi could tell something in there clenched.

“You take too much on yourself,” she said.

Hope rose that against all odds she had found the right words to-

“I used to admire that, but no longer,” Maryam said. “You take it in and bottle it up until a good shake makes the cork pop and it all comes spilling out. It’s no good for you and it may just be worse for us.”

Song swallowed.

“It is,” she tried, then hesitated. “It is how I am, Maryam.”

“No one is like that,” Maryam gently replied. “You learn to be.”

She looked away. There was something too much like pity in those blue eyes, and she did not have it in her to be angry at the other woman right now.

“Regardless, I apologize,” Song croaked, licking dry lips. “I did not truly believe the accusation I levied at you. It will not happen again and I will make amends however I can.”

How, she was not sure. But until she had how could any of them trust her? She would do what she must to make up for her mistakes.

“There’s no penance to be had here,” Maryam tiredly replied. “You are not my bondswoman for seven years, freed of bonds and guilt on the final morning. If there is work to be done, it is not for me.”

“I don’t understand,” Song admitted. “I owe Tristan apology as well, but that does not erase-”

“Apologies don’t mean a fucking thing, Song,” Maryam said, voice rising. “You cut me, like we all cut each other, but that’s just thorns. It happens, sometimes even when you don’t mean it to. But what’s changed since, Song?”

“I know I did wrong,” she said. “Next time-”

And somehow, it was still the wrong answer.

“You can’t make yourself without flaw by… precedent, somehow” Maryam bit out. “I do not care that you lost control, I care about what I sawwhen you did. That’s what needs mending, not words thrown in anger.”

The Izvorica passed a hand through her hair, looking like a woman only a stiff breeze away from toppling.

“If the Thirteenth keeps, this is not the last time we will be left scraped raw and with reasons to claw at each other,” Maryam said. “We’ll crack again, in months or years to come.”

“And next time I will be ready,” Song insisted. “I do not repeat my mistakes, Maryam.”

“You’re not listening,” the other woman said. “I don’t want so sit with you smiling until the next pop, Song, never knowing you’re silently swallowing one thorn after another until the moment where your belly bursts and you spit them all out in our faces.”

Maryam shook her head.

“Gods, but in that moment I think you genuinely hated him,” she said. “And part of that is on Tristan, but it’s also on you. Because it got that far without anyone doing about it and you’re the one who’s supposed to want the Thirteenth Brigade to work.”

That more than anything else Maryam had said, rang true. And cut deepest.

“There is only so much I can do,” Song got out. “I am not…”

She swallowed, unsure what the right words would be. ‘Perfect’ would be arrogant even in denial. ‘A miracle worker’ was putting Tristan on a pedestal, if an ill one. He was not some evil spirit without reason. The urge to claim you had failed at a high rung of the ladder, Uncle Zhuge once told her, was a common reaction to having lost your footing much lower. A grand failure was easier to swallow than a petty one.

“I don’t know what I am to do,” Song admitted. “When we first met at the Rookery I thought I knew what lay ahead, but since we came to Tolomontera I have been lost.”

“And if we were still at the Rookery, I’d wave all this away,” Maryam said. “But we aren’t, and I can’t excuse the mistakes woman in front of me for the sake of the one I met there.”

She sighed.

“History won’t weigh on the scales, Song,” Maryam told her. “That’s what this… bloodletting taught me. The one thing I can’t forgive from this whole debacle is that when Tredegar called me useless I had nothing to contradict her with.”

“You are still learning,” Song carefully said.

“That’s an excuse,” the other woman firmly said. “I have had too much truck with those of late. I have been gnawing at grudges instead of looking ahead, it’s no wonder I fell behind.”

Maryam let out a yawn, covering it with her hand.

“I am not keeping to these hours to spite you, Song,” she said. “Yue’s pushing harder because she’s heard rumors the Thirteenth had a blowout, but I’ve been volunteering past what she asks.”

She leaned in.

“I am stepping forward instead of being dragged, and it has made a difference.”

“So you have gotten real answers,” Song said. “Not just…”

Been told lobotomy was a potential solution.

“They only brought more questions,” Maryam said, “but that is the road: fill the unknown piece by piece until you are left with a map. Until the next time I am called useless, I can look that person in the eye and call them a liar.”

“You are not useless,” Song told her.

The Izvorica’s face shuttered again, but Song was too tired to wince. They matched gazes for a long moment, silver to blue, until the signifier looked away.

“I’m not sure,” Maryam quietly said, “whether I hate or love that you really believe that.”

She pushed off her seat, snatching up her cloak.

“Good night, Song,” she said. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”

A beat,

“Good night, Maryam,” she replied.

Not quickly enough that she was addressing anything but a retreating back.

Song emptied the rest of the cold tea into the garden bushes, trying not to look at the iron teapot she had dented in her rage. How it still served but might be injured for good.

How that felt like the worst sort of omen.

—

They headed to class together in the morning. Maryam had not accompanied her like this in days so it felt like a victory, however trifling one.

Still, with Teratology looming ahead Song was glad of even such a small thing. She did not speak much on the way, instead reciting inside her head the readings she had done. Not that Maryam seemed in all that chatty a mood. Professor Kang, Song suspected, would be eager for an opportunity to dole out humiliation for any perceived failing of hers. To stay a step ahead she had gone to the private library in the Galleries and picked out the three works she judged most likely to be upcoming assigned readings for the class.

Two of them were Teratology manuals, of which there were multiple copies with some in different print – a sign they had been in use for long, classics. She had read up to the fifth chapter in each. The third work was the one she spent the most time on, however. It was a treatise, not a proper book, but its title and author had commanded her full attention: Systematic Collapse, by Yun Kang.

It was a methodical, detailed analysis of what the fifteen years following the Dimming had done to the lands of the Republic of Jigong. Too detailed for him not to have been out there, seeing it with his own eyes. It had made for… harrowing reading, but read it Song had. She was prepared.

The walk through Scholomance to get to class was somehow even more wearying than it had been the first day, perhaps because Song knew what was waiting for her at the end. She kept her wits about her, ignoring the temptations the school dangled their way – shortcuts and hidden libraries, a warm kitchen smelling of freshly baked bread and once a scared child screaming. That one had a few students hesitating before their friends pulled them back.

Scholomance, Song saw, was watching them from the walls. Learning what had worked and what had not. No, she thought. Not learning. Remembering. It had waned, starved of souls to feed on for so long, but corpse after corpse it was gaining back in strength. In mind.

It was a grim thought, and it was in a grim mood she arrived in class. She and Maryam had arrived ahead of most, and they took the same desks near the middle of the room. The air in the crypt always felt slightly damp, and Song’s eyes could not help but stray at the stuffed lemures looking at her from the walls and ceiling. It was as if Kang had a hundred eyes, each of them staring at her unblinking.

Song was careful to avoid looking at the front of the class where the professor stood, not to give him an excuse.

Angharad arrived with the Thirty-First shortly before the beginning of class, and much like the last few students to hurry in they were sweaty and harried. Zenzele even had a cut on his cheek, a sure sign that Scholomance had tried something. Not that Professor Kang cared.

“Another twenty seconds and you would have been late,” he chided. “Laziness is not a habit to boast of.”

Shalini looked furious, but Ferranda laid a hand on her arm to keep her from speaking. The infanzona had good instincts. Denied a reason to continue hectoring them, Professor Kang hummed and passed by his desk to snatch up his wooden baton while Angharad settled at the desk to Song’s left, sparing a nod her way.

“Now that the distractions are over with,” Professor Kang said, “let us begin.”

He began his lecture without so much as a glance her way but Song knew better than to lower her guard.

She would admit, however, that he was a compelling speaker. Unlike Professor Sasan he did not invite discussion, but neither was his lecture the kind that put students to sleep. After spending half an hour outlining the fundamental differences between an ‘animal’ and ‘creature’ – the latter term being a catch-all term including lares and lemures, though he noted that less scholarly literature also referred to them as ‘monsters’ – he laid out the basics of the Takata Index for them.

It was the manner by which the teratologist of the Watch ranked the threat of particular creatures on a scale of one to ten. Kang flatly informed them that they should memorize the criteria he had written on the slate, for they would be tested not only on listing them but by applying the Takata Index on example creatures.

Then he pivoted her way and it began.

“Captain Ren,” the professor smoothly said. “Who was it that first laid out a distinction between lares and lemures?”

He wanted her, Song thought, to answer ‘the Second Empire’ so he could tut at her inexactness. Fortunately for her, she had read the second chapter of Categorias Naturales.

“Cornelia Marca, on behalf of Emperor Raul II,” she replied. “Sir.”

The man paused, stroking his beard.

“A basic answer,” he said, and moved on.

A few minutes of learning about the early Lierganen origins of the formal discipline followed, but the swerve inevitably came.

“Captain Ren,” he thinly smiled, “how is it that creatures from regions hundreds of thousands of miles apart can share the same physiology? Let us take lupines for an example.”

Arbor Vitae, fourth chapter. He had changed manuals.

“According to the theory of origin, sir,” Song replied, “it is because these creatures came from the same original animals. In the case of lupines, dogs.”

His face tightened.

“Speculative at best,” Professor Kang said, turning away.

Twice now he had come for her and missed. Unless he was deaf he would be hearing the same whispers spreading across the class she did. It was one thing for a professor to pick on a student, another for that professor to fail. A man worried about his reputation would have stopped.

Yung Kang did not.

The next question he asked her was only tangentially related to what was even being discussed, about the proper name for the mutations aether caused in plant anatomy, and there she had to admit ignorance. The smirk returned.

She could not answer the next two questions either, and after the last he sighed in disappointment.

“It seems you will need all the help you can get, Captain Ren,” the professor said. “You, in front, your name?”

He was addressing a short Izcalli girl sitting in the front row, her head shaved save for a stripe going down the back and two tufts on the sides. Contracted.

“Captain Tozi Poloko,” she replied. “Nineteenth Brigade.”

“Trade seats with her, Captain Tozi,” Professor Kang ordered.

Song wilted under the gazes of the classroom as she was made to pack up her things and move them up front, the other captain sending her an unfriendly look for the trouble. Kang ceased questioning her after that, but he made it a point to always walk back and forth near her with his baton trailing across her desk. It made her tense every time and fall behind in taking notes. The lecture lasted close to three hours in whole, and shortly before dismissing the class the professor leaned in close with those shining black eyes.

“Stay behind after,” Professor Kang ordered her.

Song put away her notes even as the rest of the class began to leave. Maryam glanced back twice, but the professor’s cocked eyebrow dissuaded her from lingering. Soon she was the only one left, the professor shuffling papers on his desk. After waiting there for five minutes, Song dared to clear her throat.

“Sir,” she cautiously asked. “What can I do for you?”

Professor Kang looked up, seemingly surprised.

“Still here, Ren?” he said. “You will be late for your next class.”

She grit her teeth. Was he really that petty?

“As you say, professor,” she stiffly replied, grabbing her bag.

He smirked.

“Although, since you are here,” Professor Kang idly said. “I am curious – are you a jiang wu practitioner, Captain Song?”

She blinked in surprise.

“Sword dances?” she asked. “No, sir. I never learned any.”

She had been taught traditional swordsmanship, certainly, but still one meant to be used – not a largely ceremonial performance. Sword dances took skill but not necessarily the same skills used in genuine combat. Bafflingly, the answer brought a vicious sort of satisfaction to the man’s face.

“No,” Kang smiled. “I thought not. Go on, then. Get going.”

She was glad to, uncomfortable standing alone in the room with a man who meant her ill. Song had tried to think of the professor as a test, something she could make a reputation from, but today made that… difficult. Kang seemed entirely willing to go as far as he needed to make her pass as ignorant – how many in the class would have been able to answer the questions she did correctly? How many who were not Savants? It was with gritted teeth she left.

Reaching the hall outside, Song found she might be the least to leave but there were still some lingerers. A pair of Tianxi was standing at the end pf the hallway, by the stairs, talking in low voices. One was contracted. His name was Hong Hua, and he could move… the location of wounds by touch? Interesting. She tore away her gaze before it could be noticed. It took three more steps for Song to recall one detail – that particular spelling of ‘Hua’ as a surname, it was uncommon.

Almost only used around the southern shore of Hehou River, the border with the Imperial Someshwar. The Republic of Jigong’s border with the Someshwar, to be precise.

Song heard the classroom door close behind her, and it saved her life – she glanced that way, eyes widening when she saw two more students had hidden on either side of the door. One had a pistol aimed at her, and as he pulled the trigger she ducked. The shot sounded, the bullet tearing into her bag and sending chunks of paper flying. That was her notes, some part of her dimly raged. Her own pistol was not loaded, a dire mistake, so instead her sword cleared the scabbard as she dropped her bag. It would only get in her way.

“Help,” she shouted, but there was no one.

Only her, enemies and a closed door. The ambusher without the pistol – contracted, Renshu, something something all-devouring – let out a sharp laugh, unsheathing a curved dao saber as he stepped forward. Movement behind, but if she let them dictate this she was dead. Ignoring the threat at her back she ran towards her ambushers, ignoring the surprise on their faces as she rushed the pistol wielder. The contracted saberman stepped between them as the other man yelped, dropping his pistol and fumbling for the straight sword at his hip.

Two steps, thrust. The saber came to swat down her blade but Song was already moving out of the feint. Pivot, sweep low and cut – ‘Renshu’ hastily backed into the door to avoid getting his throat sliced, impacting it with a thud. The other man got his blade out, just in time for Song to smoothly drop and sweep his leg. Always moving, gathering strength like the wind. He stumbled back, head smacking against the wall as he fell. Dropped his sword.

Saber strike from the left, a quick cut to her sword arm’s shoulder. Not the neck? Not a feint either, Song found as she flicked a strike at his knee to trip the faint but found him leaning into the blow instead. She turned withdrawing that probing blade into a rising pivot strike at Renshu’s face that had him leaning back, momentum against him and… there, she slid her boot’s toe under the dropped sword, tossing it straight up.

She tossed her sword at Renshu’s face, forcing him back with his saber high, snatched the other sword out of the air by the grip and smoothly slid it into the other man’s throat as he got back on his feet – his movement only driving it all the way through. She ripped the sword free as the sole woman screamed Liu, turning to face the others. Step forward, breathe in and out. Never stop moving.

Renshu would soon be at her back, so she swept forward towards the pair charging her.

“You bitch,” Hong Hua snarled, raising his blade.

A large changdao, two-handed saber raised high. A horse-killer, slow but strong. One good strike on the head and she was done. Only he stood as if he were aiming not at her skull but at her shoulder. Between that and Renshu’s shoulder blow? They wanted her alive.

She could use that.

The woman had lowered her spear, threatening her ribs, but instead of trying to juggle the both of them Song stepped right into Hong’s blow – the angle put him between Song and the spear, and in the moment he hesitated to bring down the sword Song thrust her blade into his belly. It caught on the coat, away from the slow death of a deep wound and into the sides. Hong still screamed hoarsely as she rammed her shoulder into his chest, toppling him down.

Song moved to rip out the dead man’s sword, but the weight was slightly off and – the edge caught against a brass button, failing to slice through the thread beneath. She was just a heartbeat too slow to avoid getting hit with the spear, raising an arm to protect her from the shaft but still being forced stumbling back.

Without the sword.

She reached for her pistol, even unloaded, but Renshu was on her before it was even half out. He hammered down at her folded elbow with the pommel of his saber, then as she screamed and felt muscle tear he caught her by the throat and threw her down. Song’s back hit stone, stealing breath out of her lungs.

“Get me to Liu,” Hong shouted. “Quick, before-”

She saw the spear come down, rolled to avoid the blow but the wooden length still hit her on the shoulder. Song tensed, a mistake: Renshu kicked her in the back and she convulsed in pain, shouting.

“Go yourself,” the woman snarled. “She’s not down yet.”

Hands trembling, she got her pistol out and pointed it at Renshu, who took half a step back – only for his ally to swat at her hand with the spear, white-hot pain streaking across her phalanges as she dropped the empty pistol. A blow followed on the head, blinding her for a heartbeat.  She tried roll away, to crawl, but a kick got her back on her belly and then the saber’s edge was resting on her throat.

“Move and you die,” Renshu panted, red-faced. “No more risks with you, Song Ren.”

Song stilled, though she was nauseous from the last kick and could taste bile in her mouth. Her vision was swimming from that head blow, but she still saw Hong Hua leaving a trail of blood through his hand as he knelt by Liu’s body and laid a hand on his face. She saw strands of blood red connect them both, and something moving down them from Hong onto Liu until the corpse’s face burst into a bloody shower. The wound, she realized. He had moved his wound onto the dead man.

“Fuck,” Hong shakily breathed out. “That was close.”

“I told you we should have killed her outright,” the woman said.

“We were never going to get a better chance than this, Meihui,” Hong bit out. “With the mirror-dancer gone-”

“Liu’s dead,” Renshu harshly said.

“Another corpse for the Ren tally,” the other man replied.

Song opened her mouth to say something, anything, but she was finding it hard to focus and – the spear came down again, hitting her in stomach. She turned over to throw up, Renshu’s blade barely withdrawing in time.

“Not here,” Hong said. “Take her to the room. We can’t trust Kang to keep quiet if we do it here, he’s too much of a weasel.”

“He said-”

Song did not hear what Professor Kang had said, for someone had caught her by the collar and was dragging her away. She felt dulled, like her body was barely her own. She was not sure how long they moved her, but after some time she was propped up against a wall – and then a sharp slap across the face brought her back to the present.

“There,” Meihui said. “That should do it.”

She was so short, Song thought. Barely even five feet. It made that braid going down her back look much longer. The tip of the spear pressed against her belly.

“Figured it out yet?” the other woman asked.

“You’re all from Jigong,” Song hoarsely replied.

Someone laughed. Hong, she saw. He was dragging Liu’s mangled corpse to rest it against the wall. Broad and just short of fat, with a messy topknot and dark eyes.

“The republic, yes,” he agreed. “Not the city. I’m from Baoban myself, higher up the river.”

A week ago Song would never have heard the name, but she had read Systematic Collapse since.

“Where they made Glare-touched oil,” she croaked out.

“Pride of the town,” Hong smiled as he approached. “Supplied half the lanterns in Jigong and even sold across the river. Our elders heard about the Dimming just a day before the riders from the capital came, waving those orders that’d empty our stocks of oil.”

His smile widened, absolutely mirthless.

“Only there were still two years left before the lottery, so there wasn’t all that much set aside yet,” Hong said. “We might run out. So the elders refused, closed the gates, and the riders left angry.”

The man pushed off the wall.

“They came back a week later, Ren, with two thousand men and cannons. Sacked Baoban, put most the elders to the sword and were careless enough looting us that half the oil they came to steal went up in flames anyway.”

Hong’s fingers clenched.

“My elder brothers died in that fire,” he said. “My aunt. Half the parents of the children I grew up with. Those who got to grow up at all – there were more hollows than men in Baoban, by the time the Watch recruited me.”

“I had yet to be born,” Song croaked out.

“And that’s an excuse?” Hong scoffed.

“You think we don’t know your family cut a deal?” Meihui said. “That the Old Devil stayed but the rest of you got to run off to some relatives down south? We didn’t all get to be raised in some cushy estate, Ren.”

The spear tip pressed stronger against her, scuffing the coat.

“My family headed to Luban as soon as I was old enough to walk,” Meihui said. “Like half those fleeing Jigong. It was misery getting there, people turning on each other like animals when bread ran out and the lights went low, but we made it to the border. We did.”

Her face clenched like a fist.

“Only they stopped us at the border, at Hongying Pass,” Meihui snarled. “The soldiers said the Republic of Luban was closed to refugees. And they watched as we starved to death, until all the virtuous were dead and the rest of us ate their corpses.”

The edge of the spear rose until it was but an inch away from Song’s eye. She did not blink, or shy away from the other woman’s gaze. How could she, when she was looking at her family’s legacy?

“The things my mother did to keep us alive, the things my sisters were forced to… oh, for that you get to die slow,” Meihui softly said.

And Song couldn’t help it. She laughed. What else was there to do?

“You-” Meihui began.

“Come on then, Renshu,” Song said, looking at the man still keeping an eye on the door. “Shall I hear your tale of woe as well? You’ll only get to kill me once. Make it count.”

The man matched his blade, narrow of face and build but sharp of cheek and eye. His head was all but shaved and his eyebrow notched with a small scar that did not go all the way through. He felt, she thought, like the most dangerous of the three. This one watched and waited where the others blustered.

“You get no tale from me,” Renshu replied. “Only this: after dooming thousands upon thousands, Chaoxiang Ren lived for two years in a comfortable tower cell as Jigong withered around him.”

“He did not  bargain for that,” Song sharply replied. “He was detained for the Ministry until he could be made to stand trial before magistrates of every republic.”

Just before they announced that Jigong was forever estranged from the lottery. The sentence, she’d been told, was still famous. Two lashes from every magistrate save for Jigong’s, who went last and got only one, then the sequence was to begin anew. Again and again until death ensued. ‘Eighty-nine lashes, still no light’ had since become a proverb for times where a punishment felt too weak for the crime.

“They should have killed you all then and there,” Renshu mildly said. “Nine degrees of extermination, like the old kings swore by. This is nothing more than the rectification of that mistake.”

The ugly, bubbling mirth had never been far and it tore out of her throat again. She laughed in his face, all their faces.

“No, it is not. This is children taking out their hate on the only Ren they could find,” Song said. “Dress it up however you like, we all know the truth: you disregard zunyan and seek private satisfaction. You wander the land without knowledge of righteous and the unrighteous.”

She got blank looks at that, Meihui shooting Renshu a confused look.

“It’s from the Fangzi Yongtu,” the sharp-faced man said. “She’s saying we have no principles.”

“Ah,” Meihui smiled. “My mother never got to teach me the Purpose of the House, Ren. You see, she-”

“I don’t care.”

Someone said the words in her voice. With her lips. From the corner of her eye, Song saw Luren sitting in the corner all askew with a wide-brimmed straw hat pulled down to hide his face. All she saw of it was the barest edge of a smile.

“I don’t care,” Song repeated, breathing out.

What a relief it was to say that, after all these years. Like she was breathing fresh air for the first time in her life.

“You stand there lecturing me about horrors while claiming it a crime for me to be born? Pathetic,” she told them. “You don’t get to pretend this is revenge. This is, this is a tantrum. So spare me the tears, the stories and get it fucking over with.”

She had spent her whole life suffering for her name. She would not spend her death doing the same.

“They won’t,” Luren said from his corner, tearing the cork from his wine gourd with a resounding pop. “They want you to scream, child. They hope that’s what they’ll hear when they sleep, instead of the other ones.”

“You don’t get to decide that,” Meihui coldly said.

“It won’t change anything,” Song told her god, ignoring her. “Nothing does.”

“Wrong,” Luren happily said. “Fool. Something is not nothing, only nothing can be something.”

The torture, Song hoped, would be less tedious than this. The false monk drank deeply of his gourd, wiping his mouth with a pleased sight afterwards.

“And you have put out something,” the god said. “So something is there.”

He paused.

“The woman has the compass,” Luren added, and then he was gone.

Sharp pain across her cheek drew back Song’s gaze, Meihui standing over her with a fuming look.

“If slaps are not enough,” she said, “perhaps losing a few fingers will help you keep focus.”

Song licked cracked lips, tasting the vomit on her tongue, and was attempting to form a pithy reply – the way her vision kept wobbling was no help – when there was a shout of surprise. Hong, she thought, and she squinted past Meihui.

Someone was… Maryam?

It could not be, she thought. The door had not opened, Renshu keeping an eye on it all the while. Only Maryam was there, idly strolling past the sharp-faced man as the others all raised their weapons. She no longer wore her hooded cloak, instead in a loose black coat left open and with her long dark hair flowing freely down her back. No, Song realized. This was not Maryam. The skin was just as pale but she was taller, her eyes a cloudy blue instead of limpid. And there were some details about her face… A sharper nose, thicker brows.

And Song Ren saw the truth, as she had once begged of any god who might be listening: she was not looking at flesh but aether.

“Who the fuck-” Hong began.

“Their signifier,” Renshu interrupted. “How did you get in here?”

Not-Maryam kept walking, her stride airy, and headed straight for Song. Meihui backed away warily, spear raised. The aether-thing’s footsteps trailed dark wisps, Song saw. She was weaving Gloam without moving her hands or speaking a word. The almost familiar face frowned down at her, then sighed.

“If she was that worried about it,” Not-Maryam muttered, “she could have gone herself.”

The sound of a pistol being cocked. Hong pointed it their way.

“He asked you a question, hollow,” the man said.

The apparition spared them a glance, lip curling with distaste.

“I am not without mercy,” Not-Maryam informed them. “Should each of you cut off your right hand and beg earnestly for your life, I will allow you to depart afterwards.”

Incredulous laughter.

“And who are you, exactly?” Meihui asked.

“The last princess Volcesta,” Not-Maryam said. “I rode with the wintersworn, stood on the shore when we gave the river seven lords of Malan. I am the Keeper of Hooks, first and last of the Ninefold Nine.”

Her chin rose ever so slightly.

“You may kneel,” Not-Maryam generously allowed.

“Yiwu trash,” Hong mocked, and took aim.

The apparition snapped her fingers. Song felt the barest of ripples, but nothing happened.

Not until Hong Hua’s eyes widened and he pivoted to unload his pistol at Renshu.

“Ambush,” he shouted.

Renshu screamed, but the bullet had only hit his side. Song watched, baffled as Meihui protectively went to stand between them and the other two with her spear raised.

“Stay behind,” she instructed. “You’re in no state to-”

She frowned, struggling to finish her sentence.

“Thank you,” Not-Maryam drily said, and laid a finger against the back of her skull.

There was a pulse in the air, then a smoking hole an inch wide was in Meihui’s head. All the way through, Song saw. She stared in horror as the other Tianxi toppled to the ground. Not-Maryam glanced her way, then rolled her eyes.

“Don’t look so troubled, it’s only a perception twist,” she said. “If they had not come intent on violence there would have been nothing to switch around.”

“What are you?” Song croaked. “Gods, what are you?”

“Leftovers and leavings,” Not-Maryam easily replied, then cocked an eyebrow. “Now would be a good time for effusive thanks, you useless ingrate.”

“You’re not Maryam,” Song accused.

“I’ll let that one pass on account of your seeming concussion,” Not-Maryam mused, “but I must admit this is not the most stimulating conversation I’ve ever had.”

“What did you do?”

The scream drew her gaze back the other way, where Renshu stood over Hong’s headless corpse. One hand was on his wound, but the other held a saber woven out of golden fire – his contract, Song thought. The weapon seemed to eat away at the very air, at everything it touched. Even at Renshu himself, slowly but surely. It ate the Sign she put in him, she realized. He’s free of it.

“I thought Tianxi prided themselves on their manners,” Not-Maryam chided him. “It is not so large a room, there is no need to shout.”

“You are no signifier,” Renshu howled. “You are a monster, a-”

“Shhh,” Not-Maryam replied putting a finger to her lips, then pointing it upwards. “You’ll make him angry.”

The man did not look up, sneering at the obvious distraction, but Song did. That was how she saw the Gloam wafting in the room had coalesced into a roiling shape up there. A horse-sized lizard with a long tail, clinging to the ceiling with its six legs as it watched Renshu with a wide-open maw at the end of a long neck. Two bulbous protrusions tore out of its back, like rounded spikes trying to unfold into something. Every part of it was stirred around in turbid strings, as if the sketch of a shape.

“Vatra,” the apparition ordered.

The thing screeched, Renshu’s eyes swiveling up only for the creature to spit out a stream of black Gloam-fire. The man slashed at the Gloam with his golden blade, erasing entire strands, but the breath was too wide. The edges still caught onto him and burned through cloth and flesh like acid. Renshu dropped, screaming, and the apparition waved permission at her creation before turning away as if she had lost interest.

The monster dropped from the ceiling without a sound, sinuously lunging forward and tearing into Renshu like a ravenous hound.

“I’m still waiting on those thanks,” Not-Maryam reminded her.

“How?” Song got out.

“Mornaric are too easily impressed,” Not-Maryam scorned. “This is nothing but a smok.”

Renshu’s screams abruptly cut out.

“Mother could form a leshy that was large as a ship. She used to pluck the legs off swordmasters with it,” the apparition continued.

Song was not sure what troubled her more: the implication that this entity might learn to do the same, or how she mentioned legs being plucked off as if it were some fond memory. Or perhaps what claimed the crown was what she began to glimpse through the layers and layers of aether, now that her eyes had grown used to the entity. All that aether had gathered onto something, like layers of paint.

And she’d never seen one like this before, but Song suspected that gnarled thing within might just be a soul.

Not-Maryam suddenly frowned, and she thought her gaze might have been noticed. Only the regal, pale-skinned thing sighed.

“Already?” she said. “At least-”

And like candle snuffed out, she was gone.

Silence.

Song Ren, still propped up against that same wall, looked at the blood and flesh-strewn room around her. Four corpses slowly cooled, not a thing alive in here save her. A thought occurred and she let out a bleak laugh.

She now had a higher body count than Tristan.

And to think she had cursed him out for bringing trouble. Her own had loomed just the same, only patiently waiting for an opening instead of skulking about. She had been so determined to turn things around, this morning, and yet now she only felt the sting of the truth in Captain Wen’s words: she knew less than nothing about the rest of the Thirteenth.

She’d thought she knew Maryam best of them, but this? The entity was connected to the Izvorica, that much was plain, and the things it had said… A princess? Wintersworn, Ninefold Nine? Maryam had never mentioned so much as a single one of these things to her. How much had Song failed to glean from Tristan, from Angharad?

A sharp irony, for her of all people to feel so blind. It all felt so futile, all of a sudden. Here she was, bruised and beaten, surrounded by corpses, and what had she learned? Only the depths of her ignorance. All this blood and pain and all she had gained was the right to fight again tomorrow.

No matter how we struggle, we’ll always end up behind, her brother had whispered. She thought of that look in Nianzu’s eyes, wondering if someone would find the same in hers right now. All for nothing.

And perhaps it was the exhaustion, the emptiness in her, but the words had her recalling Luren’s. The cryptic bullshit he had left her with again. What had it been? ‘Something is not nothing, only nothing can be something’. Nonsense. It – Song licked her lips, swallowed drily. A nothing that was something. She knew nothing of the rest of the Thirteenth, and that gap was…

Something to fill. Work. She had asked Wen for a miracle, a way to make everything better, but what she had truly wanted was for things to go back to when they still worked. Only they never had, had they? That’d been what Maryam was angry with her about last night, how she failed to understand this. Song did not need to force them all back into chairs at that kitchen table, to do it all again but right somehow. Song needed to know the people she would be sitting across.

She had spent her time trying to make the Thirteenth fight her battle when she should have spent it fighting theirs.

And that was work, that was blood and shame, but that’d been all of Song Ren’s life. What was a little more? She breathed out slowly, put a bloodstained palm against the wall and slowly pushed herself up. It seemed Luren had, distastefully enough, made himself useful not once but twice today. He’d told her one more thing she needed to know.

Which corpse to rob for the compass that’d let her crawl her way out of Scholomance’s belly.

# Chapter 25

Tristan turned in his blanket for the fourth time in ten seconds.

Eyes stubbornly closed, he turned again and put his feet against the wall. The stargazing tower was all cramped squeezes and windows, which usually the thief thought of as a selling point. Only one way up from the inside, and Tristan had undone the screws on the ladder the first day: he could topple it with a single well-placed kick any time he wanted. Not that he needed to.

But he could.

He turned in his blanket again, feet sliding down to the floor. The door down there was closed and he’d set the easy cousin of a tripwire – a metal goblet atop the latch – so there would be no entering without waking him if he slept. Fortuna would be keeping an eye out for him, too. Only Fortuna could be seen, could be worked and planned around, and that changed things. Made bedrock certainties altogether more porous.

Tristan turned once more, then cursed and pulled himself up. His goddess wasn’t around, though he caught a glimpse of red out on the roof, and his eyes strayed to the open trap door to his side. To the top of the ladder, which he could still make out in the gloom. It was too late, reason whispered into his ear, for Song Ren to still believe killing him would be enough to bury this whole affair. Questions would be asked, obvious inferences made.

Tristan forced himself to get up, to undo the latch one of the windows. Well-greased, it opened without a sound. He was presented with the sight of the Lady of Long Odds leaning back against a thatched roof as if it were some painting: waves of red and gold bathed in the distant light of the Orrery, eerily still until she turned to glance his way.

“Still awake?” she asked, half-surprised.

“Can’t sleep,” Tristan replied.

He leaned past the windowsill, breeze long robbed of the salt of the sea lazily combing through his air.

“Still feverish from the scrap downstairs, I imagine,” the Lady of Long Odds mused. “It takes a while to wind down.”

It would. But it had been hours and the fighting tense had long left him. Tristan knew why he couldn’t sleep, and it was the same reason part of him squirmed uncomfortable at showing his back to the ladder even though the door downstairs was locked and trapped.

Without noticing it he had gotten comfortable, and now that’d he noticed it he could not unsee it.

His fingers clenched and he smoothed away the discomfort of that understanding from his face. Not that it served anything when faced with the goddess that had known him since he was barely more than a child.

“It got ugly,” Fortuna acknowledged. “Song-”

“She is not going to creep in the night and slit my throat,” Tristan sad, and he believed the words as he said them.

“But if she wanted, she could,” the Lady of Long Odds said.

Yes. But she could.

If it came to a straight fight, he would lose. She wore that blade like someone used to wielding it and he had never seen her miss a shot. He was barely taller than her and though unsure who would be physically stronger she – he grit his teeth.

“She can see you,” Tristan muttered. “If she wanted to take me by surprise…”

She could work around Fortuna. He’d never even considered that might be something people could do, before Song. Before Hage’s casual reminder that the world was always larger than you thought.

“Tredegar would not brook silencing you that way,” Fortuna said. “And Maryam-”

“Maryam left me here,” he hissed. “With a better killer whose life would be made easier if I-”

He forced himself to stop there. It had been an ugly scene, and he blamed no one for wanting to leave it. Tredegar had, if anything done so with dignity. But part of him had assumed that when it came to flight he and Maryam would be headed the same way.

Another false comfort.

“I won’t fall asleep here,” Tristan said. “Not more than the hour and change I’ve already stolen.”

Fortuna half-rose, long curls swept back by the wind.

“Where to?” she asked, smiling.

“To do the work I should have begun the moment I walked off those docks,” Tristan grimly replied.

He was already dressed, save for the coat, so it was only a matter of grabbing. his affairs. He slid down the side of the stargazing tower onto the roof, closing the window behind him, then shimmied down. The thief was gone with barely a whisper, through the garden and down the stairs.

It was simple due diligence to have another place to sleep, to have a stash ready in case it all went south, and he would rest when the proper precautions were taken. It was a dangerous failing on his part not to have handled this already. Tristan had let himself be distracted by the threats and mysteries, taken in by the illusion of safety. In a sense, the earlier… dispute was a welcome reminder: nothing could ever be taken for granted.

Your things were yours only until someone larger cared to take them. The cottage was a fine hiding place and he now regretted sharing it, but there was no putting that pot back together. He would have to find another, perhaps something closer to the docks. The port was thick with opportunities for a thief, and it would be unwise to stash stolen goods in a house to which Angharad Tredegar had access.

Making his way under the dark blue light he’d heard some soldiers called the Indigo Moon – it swept through Allazei only between one and three in the morning – he kept to main streets despite disliking the open grounds. At this time of the night there were sure to be lemures skulking around the cottage’s vicinity, so haste won over discretion.

His instincts were not wrong: a pair of shades watched him from rooftops as he hurried, slender silhouettes standing unnaturally still. Yet though Tristan was alone and not particularly large, he was carrying steel and did not look wounded. Not so easy a target. They followed him for a few blocks but ultimately chose not to try their luck. A relief. Shades were scavengers and bottom feeders – in Sacromonte, they were best known for snatching infants – but they had long, sharp nails and feverish strength.

The thief doubted they would have killed him, but they would have likely bled him and the smell might have drawn in something nastier. It was still a long way to dockside.

Haste proved enough to get him there without incident, at least this once. It might be time to look into obtaining some scent that would put off lemures – Hage was sure to have something, although in even the most favorable outcome to asking the question the devil was sure to wildly overcharge him for it. The thief knew shades disliked the false fruits of yew, but he was reluctant to put on necklace of them without knowing if the smell might draw the curiosity of something more dangerous.

It was slightly before two in the morning he reached Regnant Avenue, the hour of a city’s exhale: when the last drunks stumbled out, the last lights dimmed, when dark and silence swallowed street after street. On another night Tristan might have tried his hand at snatching a few things off drunks near the docks, but tonight he had other priorities. Instead he prowled the small streets, keeping to alleys and shadows, and took the measure of the town as he ghosted through it.

It felt a little like coming home.

Port Allazei, mused as the Indigo Moon began to wane, really was a town camped in a city’s corpse. The ruined city was mostly empty, with the parts that were safe and largely rebuilt – the Triangle, the streets closest to the docks and barracks – packed to the gills with students, teachers and townsfolk. Yet though the inhabited portions of Allazei was small, even in that small space Tristan found room to disappear.

In a place like Sacromonte it was best to disappear by becoming a drop in the sea, but Allazei was a warren of nooks and crannies. You just had to find one large enough to fit you.

Leaving the overflowing streets of the Triangle, the thief skirted just past the edges of Regnant Avenue and Templeward Street where the numbers began to thin. That was the sweet spot lay, as far as Tristan was concerned: far enough no one ventured there without a reason, close enough he was well within the regular patrol routes of the garrison. Easy meat for neither lemures nor men. Now he just needed to find a building that met the right standards.

On the Templeward side, about ten minutes away from where Wen and Mandisa had settled, he sniffed out a derelict two-story house with broken stairs and a mostly intact attic. Perfect. Tristan stashed away a blanket, two silvers and a pilfered knife in the attic before hiding rope top climb under the kitchen rubble. He checked the surrounding houses for risks, particularly rooftop access to his hidden perch, but the sole roof that had not collapsed was angled the wrong way and playing host to a bird nest besides.

He sat on that rooftop for a moment, the tiles digging into his legs as he snacked on a few sesame seeds, and let his gaze wander the city’s skyline as the last drops of the Indigo Moon bled out of the sky. Soon the Orrery’s next ring would spin along, bringing in pale and gold, and-

“Huh.”

“Finally in a talking mood again, I see,” Fortuna said.

He glanced to the side, finding her perched near the edge of the roof with her dress’s folds cascading over it. She was leaning away from him, peering down at what he suspected was the bird’s nest tucked away between two broken tiles.

“Something like that,” Tristan said. “There’s a light on the horizon.”

“You know pretending it didn’t happen won’t make it true,” the Lady of Long Odds said. “You should reach out to Maryam, at le-”

His jaw clenched.

“There is,” he flatly repeated, “a light on the horizon.”

A long silence. A sigh.

“Some sort of tower, you think?” Fortuna asked.

He hummed. It had to be, the thief thought. Out in the east of Port Allazei, short of the empty canal that delineated Scholomance grounds but well past the inhabited slice of shore, a silver light was shining. Higher than a three-story house, at a guess, and for the burn to be that stable and visible he would almost think it some sort of lighthouse. Only what would a lighthouse be doing so far inland, and in an abandoned part of the city to boot?

“It’s too far out to be the workshop the Umuthi Society set up for their students,” he said. “There shouldn’t be anything out there, as far as I know.”

“Could be a trap,” Fortuna said, enthusiasm noticeably rising at the prospect.

“Could be,” he agreed. “Only I’d never heard rumors of there being some kind of cursed tower out east, and the soldiers would gossip about a ghostly light. Which means they know what it is and they’re not worried.”

“That or they’ve been told to keep their mouths shut,” Fortuna added.

Tristan nodded, chewing at the inside of his cheek. Either way, it meant that tower its silver light were related to the Watch.

“Something that’s only out there if you find it?” he finally said. “Sounds to me like Mask business.”

Even if he was wrong and it turned out the Watch simply had some sort of hidden fort out there, that was valuable information as well. His instincts weren’t leaning that way, though. This felt like another test in this island overrun with them, and his covenant fit the bill better than the rest.

“Yesss,” Fortuna grinned. “We’re going to the trap cursed tower, aren’t we?”

Tristan decided not to confirm it, lest her further enthusiasm talk him out of the idea. If he didn’t spend his seventhday chasing down a mystery, he might just have to look back instead – and he dared not.

“Come on,” he said instead. “Let’s find out if that attic lets the wind in.”

—

After a pleasant and surprisingly windless nap, he was back on the streets come the sixth hour.

One of the fancy bakeries on Templeward made the mistake of leaving out fresh baskets, so at the cost of one pebble tossed strategically against a kitchen pan to distract the attendant Tristan acquired a breakfast of two freshly baked sweet buns. He scarfed them in a nearby alley, wishing he’d grabbed more. Potato flour, like they used in Old Saraya, but those little bits on sugar on top were delicious.

He dipped seaside to wash his hands free of incriminating stickiness and draw from one of the garrison wells for water, then began heading east as Port Allazei woke up around him. The thief would have likely kept to side streets even were enemies not out to collect the bounty on his head, but that turn gave particular reason to a general practice of caution. Not that even the ‘main’ streets were anything to be impressed about, once you were five minutes east of Templeward.

The wide road the garrison used for patrols was cleaned of debris, but it was missing quite a few paving stones and those holes would be turning into puddles when it began raining in a few hours. Seventhday was the rain day, after all, from nine to nine.

Tristan missed his tricorn.

Past the ruins of what had once been a market – and a large one, too, not just a shopping street – Tristan found that a park had swallowed an entire chunk of the city. Trees and thorny bushes had taken over streets and houses alike, casting shadows in the silver morning light, and overgrown roots slid across streets so full of dead leaves and dirt they might as well have been forest ground. If he’d not misremembered the tower’s direction, going through this was the quickest way to get there.

Tristan took one look at those winding paths and eerily rustling leaves, then took the long way around.

“Coward,” Fortuna complained.

“A long-lived one, I hope,” he agreed.

He went further east, skirting the edge of the forest while keeping a wary eye out for anything that might be inclined to crawl out. It felt a safe assumption the woods were a nest of lemures, at the very least. Yet when he caught sight of movement it was not out in the trees. A pair of blackcloaks, muskets in hand, were strolling across a small street while chatting. A patrol? They seemed too few for this far out in the city. Slipping into the alleys, Tristan followed them.

He wrinkled his nose at how easy they proved to tail, barely paying attention to their surroundings.

The pair walked along the edge of the woods westwards, much like a patrol would, but the thief never got close enough to eavesdrop on the conversation. Their carelessness was interesting – people only acted like that when they felt safe, or at least like others would bail them out should there be danger. Were there other watchmen out here? Their ‘patrol’ came to an end after another five minutes and they headed back the same way they’d come.

Tristan followed behind, keeping a safe distance until his steps went past where he’d come across them and the continuing east. Five minutes later, he came to a halt while sucking in a surprised breath.

“That’s a fort,” Fortuna helpfully pointed out, biting into an apple.

She made the crunch of it obnoxiously loud, no doubt on purpose.

“I can see that,” Tristan replied, rolling his eyes.

Across an open plaza from the edge of the woods, the Watch had built what looked like a fortified village. The walls were made from stones visibly from half a different sources but they stacked a solid fifteen feet high, armed guards waited by open gates. Inside he could see a well near the entrance, then barracks and a cluster of buildings spread out along three cramped streets.

The two watchmen out on patrol stopped to chat with the pair in front before entering, leaving Tristan to weigh his chances. Those walls were to keep lemures, not men – not with so many jutting handholds – so it would not be impossible for him to climb over. He’d have to remain hidden the whole time, though. He was in fighting fit, not the rank-and-file uniform. A risky enterprise, if the Watch was hiding something here.  It was tempting to simply go up and ask if students were allowed entry, but they’d be on guard for him trying to sneak in if they refused.

While debating whether he should avoid the fort entirely, swing around and continue northeast towards the tower, Tristan frowned as he saw someone come up to the well and work the crank. That was not a regular’s uniform, and the dark-skinned woman wearing it was young. Student age. Two more people approached her, another in a coat and the last in a formal uni- Oh, Tristan knew that one. He was looking at Captain Tristan Ballester, of the Forty-Fourth Brigade. He of the impressively well-groomed mustache and mediocre ability to read the room.

That settled it. The guards at the gate looked him over when he emerged onto the street, but not with any particular intent. When he approached, the taller of the two cleared her throat.

“Plaque,” she instructed.

He produced it. The Someshwari watchwoman took a look, then handed it back.

“Welcome to Scraptown,” she told him.

The other guard snorted.

“Stop calling it that to students, the captain’ll put you on night watch again,” she said.

“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” the Someshwari beamed her way, then her eyes slid back to him. “The student dormitory’s at the end of the street to the left, one copper a night. If you’re headed for the hunting grounds, I’d recommend you swing by the board first – it’s got all the last reports nailed on.”

She looked him up and down.

“Not that you look like much of a hunter.”

“My skills are legend, tia,” Tristan protested. “Have you never heard of the many brave deeds of Ferrando Villazar?”

The shorter guardswoman squinted at him.

“Aren’t you a woman?” she asked. “And blonde. I thought you came for that lemure bounty a few days back.”

“Any resemblance in names is coincidental,” Tristan lied.

Hopefully this wouldn’t make it back to Ferranda, who was well-armed and touchy. If so, he always could try to exploit another coincidence in names and frame the captain of the Forty-Fourth for the whole matter. He made sure to give the students at the well a wide berth, though at least one noticed him passing through, and tread the length ‘Scraptown’ street by street.

It was more an outpost than a village, a strange contrast of buildings made in fine stone and bricks – salvaged from nearby houses, at a guess – and muddy streets.  There must be at least fifty watchmen posted here by the size of the barracks, but Scraptown seemed built in part to cater to students: Tristan could not think of a reason for there to be a pair of shops selling arms, equipment and foodstuffs on the main street.

The student dormitory was a run-down in with a badly patched roof consisting of a large common room and a communal kitchen, but the ‘board’ proved more interesting. It was large wooden board under an awning, with a map of the environs nailed on – including a large portion of the forest, which was named the ‘Nettlewood’. Different parts of the map were attributed numbers, and reports put up around the large parchment outlined lemure sightings in those numbered zones. At a glance, most of the lemures around here appeared to be lycosi and shuttle-spiders, though there was apparently a seiren nesting deep in the Nettlewood.

Tristan sent a discreet prayer of thanks to the Rat King for the plentiful boons of habitual cowardice.

Less pleasing was that the northeast of the outpost was apparently thick with lemures come evening time, including a pair of headless men. Nasty beasts, those, and reported to wander about where Tristan believed himself headed to. It would be best if he could be back from seeking the tower well before the Tolomontera night settled.

It was only when he reached the back gate of Scraptown that he saw why the locals had given it such a sobriquet, however. The back of the town did not have a stone wall like the rest instead but two large pieces of metal between which a makeshift gate had been squeezed in. That open gate led out into a graveyard of scrap metal, wind blowing dust through rusted iron ribs.

There were four guards at this gate instead of two, and they seemed much more alert. Tristan was asked to present his plaque on the way out, then cautioned to avoid cutting himself on the metal.

“Blood will wake up the blems,” he was told. “Last night they came close enough to get shot, they must be getting hungry.”

Blems was an old Trebian name for headless men, meaning those words were very much worth heeding. Tristan was not sure he’d win a tussle with a lycosi, much less the kind of creature that would kill them for sport. He thanked the watchmen for the warning and only ventured out with cautious steps and leather gloves on.

The grounds here were worn stone and rust-red sand, with spikes of metal jutting out like teeth and worn, twisted iron forming into crescent shapes. It felt like walking through a maze of open maws, his surroundings ready to snap up and swallow him at any time. Between making sure he didn’t step on anything capable of piercing his boots and keeping an eye out for lemures, a simple walk proved genuinely exhausting.

It was a relief when the worst of the scraps began to thin, giving ground to stairs leading up to what must be shrines – and, excitingly, a shape towering over them that might just be what he came for. There was still metal around but now it was a brass alloy instead of iron, most of it massive pipes. And the word was no exaggeration, for they were large enough he could walk through one standing upright.

Chunks of that pipework had fallen from the frames that’d once held them u, but in his mind’s eye the thief could see what it must have looked like when still hale. Some sort of web-like metal aqueduct leading towards the shrines, though what it would have carried was anybody’s guess. But after walking in the shadows of ancient wonders on a mercifully stony ground, Tristan finally found what he’d come looking for.

Part of it, anyway: at the heart of the shrines a tower of smooth stone did rise, but about two-thirds of the way up the structure abruptly ended. There was no trace of the pale light he had seen on the horizon last night, and given how brightly it’d shone it should be impossible to miss.

“Part of it is missing,” Tristan muttered. “Aether machinery?”

“The air here is thin,” Fortuna told him. “It is most unpleasant.”

Definitely some kind of aether machinery, then. Wary as he was of such things, the only way he would find answers was by having a look. He crept in the shadow of the ancient edifices, reaching the bottom of the shrines accompanied only by eerie silence. The seven machine-shrines had likely been built the same but time had cut them differently enough only traces of that remained: the brush of time had graced them all with their own shade of decay.

They still looked like sisters, mind you. The structures were all squat, almost pear-like in shape, and their roofs were rounded domes in metal long covered by green patina. They were a mixture of machinery and stone, and the great brass pipes from earlier fed into their sides at a rate of two a shrine. The gates that were the only visible way in were tall and narrow, made of carved iron splashed with patterns of gold.

Together, the seven shrines formed a rough circle surrounding what must be the bottom of the half-hidden tower. The style of it reminded him of the structure at the heart of Old Fort back on the Dominion, especially the seamless stone, but he was no expert on Antediluvian works.

Though two of the roofs had been damaged – one dome outright collapsed – Tristan first took a look at the gates. There were no locks and no rings to pull. Tossing a pebble at one did not see it turned into smoke or ash, which was promising, but trying to push them open was like, well, trying to move hundreds of pounds of metal with his arms. Not a winning cause, that.

“The true key is self-improvement,” the Lady of Long Odds sagely told him. “You must first become a musclebound fellow, capable of-”

“One of the pipes broke down just a bit back,” Tristan noted. “If I climb up, it’ll bring me straight inside the shrine.”

“-listening to the wisdom of your goddess, who ever shows you the way,” Fortuna hastily adjusted. “Good eye, though you were slow to pick up on my hints.”

“No doubt,” the thief drily replied.

The pipe on the ground proved a fine perch to climb on so he might shimmy up onto the one still connected to the shrine. It was, however, pitch black in there. Tristan hesitated – should he press on? Fool thought, he decided after a moment. The shrines weren’t going anywhere, but he had only the one life. If some shuttle-spider was nesting in there, eyeing him hungrily, he’d never know until it was too late.

He’d come back with a lantern.

—

The first drops of rain began to fall on his way back. Perhaps he should see about acquiring a hat along with the lantern.

The guards at the gate asked him about lemures while he presented his plaque, surprised when he said he’d not seen hide nor hair of one. The thief hummed as he headed into Scraptown, weighing the inconvenience of walking back to Port Allazei proper against the price hike the shops here were sure to give their goods. He was going to have to head back to the cottage at some point anyhow. Stealing his meals too often was sure to get him caught, and he’d contributed funds to the Thirteenth’s cellar so he was owed a cut.

That and he should leave a note to mention he had not been abducted, for Maryam’s sake at least. Even if she’d preferred to leave him with Song instead of letting him escort her to the – Tristan breathed in, out. That kind of thinking would not get him any closer to the tower, which was what mattered. Finding a second Mask teacher, securing his place at Scholomance. Making it certain that even if the Thirteenth fully shipwrecked he would still have a place on the island.

It was only due diligence.

Clenched up and drawn into his thoughts, he only noticed he was about to run into someone half a heartbeat before it happened. The decision was a snap – he could see no one else, the angle was right, so why not? The collision was light, measured, Tristan’s hand slipping inside the woman’s coat and snatching a small bag. He grunted when her shoulder hit his chest, pulling away.

“Watch where you’re going,” he growled, deepening his voice.

He continued past her without looking back, to give her the least look at him possible, while undoing the ties on the bag. Four silvers and nine coppers, he counted, with some rag scraps to mute their tinkling. Pouring the silvers into his hand, he reached for his own pouch. And reached again.

It wasn’t there.

“Son of a bitch,” a woman’s voice said.

Cursing, Tristan reached for the closest weapon – the pistol, loaded from earlier – and pivoted to face a curved knife pressed against his guts. He held the pistol steady, pointed at her chest, and frowned at a face he’d not recognized in passing but revealed itself as rather familiar on a second look.

“Tristan Abrascal,” Lady Cressida sneered.

“Cressida Barboza,” he answered with a charming smile.

With her hair pinned under that hat – black velvet with a golden rope around, curved top and short rim – his gaze had skimmed over her, but now there was no missing it. The noblewoman had a sharp, narrow face with a surprisingly delicate button nose and slender eyebrows that would have better belonged on a courtier than someone whose brown eyes were so cool.

“Give me my coin back,” Lady Cressida ordered.

They were alone in the street, he saw. The light drops of rain preceding the deluge had chased inside everyone not on guard duty and those guards were out of sight. They might come if there was shouting, though. Not yet.

“Give me my coin back,” he countered.

“You savagely elbowed a lady,” she said. “The least you can do is pay for my meal.”

“You elbowed an orphan,” he easily replied. “Alms are in order.”

There were three coppers more in her pouch, by his count, he was more than willing to keep the trade. It was a nicer pouch, too, and that rag scrap trick was inspired. Her eyes narrowed.

“My coin,” she said, “or I’ll open your belly.”

There was not a flicker of hesitation in her eyes. It was no idle threat.

“I’m sure you’re quick,” he said, “but quicker than squeezing a trigger? That is impressive confidence.”

“I’ve seen you shoot in Warfare,” Cressida replied. “You couldn’t hit a barn door if it was leaning into the shot.”

Which was fair, but Tristan snorted.

“From this close? Even if I miss I’ll hit something.”

Brown eyes met his. Neither blinked. A moment passed, then Cressida sighed.

“Two steps back, throw my pouch and I’ll throw yours,” she offered.

Tempting, but.

“There’s a problem with that,” Tristan said.

“And what would that be?” she asked, slightly pressing her blade into his coat.

“You’re Nineteenth,” he said. “I couldn’t trust you on the color of the sky, much less returning a courtesy.”

She frowned.

“There’s no grudge between our brigades,” she said. “What’s this about?”

Lady Cressida looked like someone trying to obscure her surprise, not someone lying in his face. Which did not mean she was not lying, only that she was a better liar than he. Tristan’s trigger-finger itched, but that business with the Nineteenth had only ever been guesswork. He knew that.

He still felt like pulling the trigger just in case.

“Adarsh Hebbar,” he said instead.

“Pardon?” Cressida blinked.

That confusion, damningly, was too genuine to be faked. No one was that good a liar.

“Bait,” he corrected.

The other Lierganen guffawed.

“This is about the business with the Fourth?” she said. “Put it to rest, then. Tozi traded the invite for information on you Dominion recommended. If you’ve a grudge there, we have no trouble: there have been no further bargains.”

Hmm. Tupoc reaching out to an Izcalli captain with a spare invitation was a simpler explanation than the Nineteenth being after his bounty. On the other hand, someone out there was still after Tristan. Dev had been supposed to meet people and that’d been work too subtle to belong to the Forty-Ninth. Clinging too strongly to the notion his unseen enemy was the Nineteenth, however, would be a mistake. It was simply uncomfortable for him to consider he might have no idea whatsoever who was after his head.

Not that he was putting suspicion of the Nineteenth to rest.

“Two steps back, but you throw first,” Tristan counter-offered.

“You’re a thief,” Cressida said.

“You’re a noble,” he pointed out. “That’s just a thief with a fancy hat.”

And though hers was mercifully bereft of feathers, that rope was golden.

“Sacromontans,” she sneered. “Wasted air, but what are we to expect out of the Old Empire’s arse except farts?”

“Colorful,” Tristan conceded, “but my offer remains unchanged.”

“Fine,” Lady Cressida said. “On three. One, two…”

They both moved on two, casual petty treachery that had him suppressing a twitch of the lips. She tossed his pouch, which he picked up while keeping his pistol upright, and idly counted the contents. As he’d thought, a silver was missing. He casually plucked one out from her pouch before tossing it. She scoffed but did not argue.

“I’d say it has been a pleasure,” Tristan cheerfully said, “but it hasn’t been and I dislike you.”

Cressida blinked at him, face displaying put-on surprise.

“Are you still here?” she asked.

He flipped her off, which she replied to in kind, and they went their own way. The whole affair, inexplicably, rather lifted his mood.

—

It took longer than he would have liked to swing by the cottage to leave a letter – and eat – then hit Regnant Avenue for a lantern. The Watch supply depot, at least, offered remarkably cheap black caps that were treated against the rain.

The walk had not gotten any longer, but the pouring rain slowed everything down. Tempted as he was to call off the expedition, Tristan grit his teeth and made the trip back to Scraptown. Come tomorrow there would be classes and he would not have as much time to spend on this. The outpost’s streets were deserted, most shops closed, and the guards at the gates were no longer the same. Showing his plague got him let in and then let out.

The scrapyard out back looked like it was bleeding.

The rust-red sand had turned into liquid slop that lapped at his boots, hiding away the waiting metal spikes. It took him twice as long to make it through the scraps this time, and the rainfall had him feeling blind the whole time. His only comfort was that the wetness was sure to hide his scent and he knew of no lemure that enjoyed standing out in the rain. Even monsters had better sense than he, it seemed. By the time he reached the stairs his pants were thoroughly drenched. Though his coat, boots and cap had been treated with wax the cloth of the pants was not and had drunk in the rain eagerly. Hopefully the inside of the tower would be dry.

He did not realize it until he was mere feet away, blaming it on the rain, but when he reached the end of the pipes there was something of a minor issue.

“Fuck,” Tristan cursed, looking at nothing.

A taunting nothing, where the shrines and tower should be.

“It’s gone,” Fortuna said, choking on a laugh.

“Thank you, Fortuna, I can see that,” he bit out.

“I mean, you can’t,” the goddess replied. “Given that it’s not actually th-”

“Where did it even go?” Tristan complained. “You can’t just disappear towers. That is not acceptable tower behavior.”

“At the risk of repeating myself,” the Lady of Long Odds mused, “evidently they ca-”

“Fuck,” Tristan cursed again. “All right, this might be a little trickier than I expected.”

“We should check if it’s only invisible, at least,” Fortuna suggested.

To his disgust, it was a reasonable suggestion. Throwing a pebble at the empty space only resulted in a thrown pebble. His little finger, which he touched the empty with, also found nothing but air. Irritated and curious, Tristan doubled back to a broken pipe and took a thumb-sized sliver of bronze alloy that had flaked off. Whether or not that metal was magic, the empty space reacted not differently to it.

“We should do this every day,” Fortuna happily said, watching him make a fool of himself.

A weapon, maybe? Stabbing at the empty space with a knife made no difference. Food, something that used to be alive? His last sesame seeds were washed away. He’d judged packing something like jerky too much of a risk for wandering through lemure hunting grounds, but he might have to try that. See if ‘flesh’, even dead one, made a difference. Until then, there was one thing he should do.

He spread a few cheap iron ball bearings on the ground where the shrines should be. He’d come back tomorrow, see what had happened to them.

“So what now?” his goddess asked, leaning against his shoulder. “While I’m all for watching you get progressively wetter and angrier, it won’t be as funny if a blem eats you at the end.”

Tristan sighed.

“I’m going to have to ask advice,” he said, “from the only person I know that’s worse than you.”

—

“Stop tracking wet all over my floor, boy,” Hage called out.

“Think of it as my passing a mop,” Tristan replied, bending down to scratch Mephistofeline’s ears.

The cat immediately plopped belly up, squarely in the way of the closing door. When it pressed him into the wall he let out a plaintive meow, but still made doe eyes in hopes of continued scratches. The thief spared him one, then eased him out of the way of the door. His reward was getting his sleeve clawed and Mephistofeline bounding away like a malcontent balloon.

“I will take that as your volunteering for the work,” the devil said without batting an eye. “The mop is out back.”

“I’m here as a client today,” the thief denied.

Hage’s impressive eyebrows raised skeptically even as the devil’s gaze discreetly swept the room. Looking for Fortuna, Tristan suspected, but his goddess had no intention of returning to the Chimerical. The requirement of an apology before being allowed entry into the shop had prompted her to require an apology from Hage for daring to ask such a thing from her.

Given the relative immortality of both entities involved, Tristan suspected that the fiercely petty standoff might well last until the end of time.

“I require payment up front,” Hage told him, leaning his elbow on the counter.

The thief snorted, sliding into the seat facing him.

“No you don’t,” he said.

The devil only smiled, teeth behind teeth. Hage made it a habit of habitually lie to him for no good reason, calling it training. While Tristan could have done without looking for the ‘white-painted bucket’ for an hour last week, he must admit he had gotten better at discerning when the devil was lying to him. Their kind did not have the same tells as humans did, but under the shells they wore there was a body just as inclined at revealing their true thoughts.

In some ways devils were sloppier than humans, since they could control their shell’s expression like a puppet and thus rarely learned to mask their own tells.

“If you are not here to spend coin on coffee, I expect tales to be bought instead,” Hage warned him. “What is it that interests you, boy?”

“That tower out east,” he said, “with the silver light on top.”

No change in expression.

“I have heard of it,” the devil said.

“I had a closer look,” Tristan revealed. “It was partially gone this morning, and by afternoon it and the shrines around it vanished into thin air.”

The devil drummed his fingers against the counter, eyebrow rocked. Tristan frowned, reaching for his pouch and palming coppers, then grit his teeth. A silver arbol tumbled across the counter, snatched up by the devil in a heartbeat.

“What do you even do with the coin?” he complained.

Hage leaned in.

“Is that what you want to know?”

Tristan sighed, shook his head.

“The tower,” he said. “Is it a Krypteia instructor?”

If not, it would fall down his list of priorities. There were mysteries enough on this island for nine lifetimes.

“It would be against the rules for me to answer that question,” Hage mildly said.

So yes, but confirmation was not allowed by the rules of the game. Or was the devil misleading him? He looked for the flicker of movement for the eyes under the eyes, the way legs pushed up at the neck muscles near the shoulders that signified restlessness. None of the hints, but then Tristan was not so deluded as to believe the devil was not teaching him to look for those tells. If he really meant to lie without getting caught, then… No, that was going in circles.

Hage was an information broker and had taken the coin. That weighed the scales towards his hint being accurate. Tristan chewed on his lip, trying out questions in his mind. If he asked for too much the devil would refuse or ask for further coin, both things he wanted to avoid.

“What made the morning different from the afternoon?” he asked.

Hage laughed.

“Clever boy,” he said, and pointed a finger upwards. “What on this island always changes but ever remains?”

He was no great riddler, but that was one was obvious.

“The Grand Orrery,” Tristan muttered.

So the difference was the light. The morning silver light – and thinking back, had the light atop the tower during the night not been silver as well? – was the key. He passed a hand through his hair, then slapped two coppers on the counter.

“Sparing me a few hours of asking around,” he said. “If I were to ask guards from Scraptown the hours where that part of the island is reliably touched by silver light?”

Hage clicked his mandibles inside his mouth, took one of the coppers and flicked the other back across the counter.

“Seven to ten of the morning,” the devil said. “With wiggle room.”

Tristan took back his copper and frowned.

“Well,” he said. “It seems I’ll be skipping a few classes, then.”

# Chapter 26

It was a risk, but it had to be done.

Tristan took all the precautions he could think of: he bought rosemary branches and rubbed them on his skin until the smell stuck, brought cloth to wrap around his boots for when he reached the shrines and fixed a shutter on the cheap lantern he’d acquired earlier. It was still half-wincing that he ventured out from Scraptown into the rusty wasteland beyond, pretending he did not hear one of the guards betting with another on whether or not he’d ever come back.

“Four to one odds on your croaking it,” Fortuna informed him. “You should try to get in on that.”

As always, his goddess was a comfort in these trying times.

In the distance, the silver light atop the tower shone like a beacon. There was no missing that unblinking pearly glare out here, and the sight of it put some enthusiasm to his step. There were dangers in coming out here, but a prize as well. It was now the third time in a day Tristan was heading to the tower, so even with bare scraps of lantern light he was able to pick out his preferred path. This time, though, there was to be no quick march through.

Lemures were out in force.

The first warning was a moan on the wind. Tristan crouched behind a mound of scraps, bringing the lantern under his cloak and shuttering it. Quieting his breath he pricked his ear, wishing the breeze would not wind through so many pieces of metal – it added a haunting, mournful sound to it. After thirty seconds he was debating getting moving again, but then there was another moan.

And three more in answer.

Pressing himself against a caved in brass box, he tucked himself out of sight and only got glimpses of the movement outside. Dark silhouettes in the dark, shambling forward in a strange procession. The thief held his breath until they were gone, and counted another two minutes before crawling out of his hiding place. That close shave, however, was but the herald what lay ahead.

That band had been a pack of shades, and he came across a second mere minutes later – as well as the tracks for another two. The footsteps they left in the still-humid red sand were narrow and shallow, as if the creatures barely weighed anything at all. Tristan nestled against the iron ribs clawing out of the ground, pressing close and holding his breath as the scavengers ambled past him. Twice one of the lemures stopped to sniff at the air, but the rosemary did its work.

For now, anyway. He had to hurry before fear and sweat washed its smell away.

Tristan trailed in the wake of the second band, figuring they were likely to avoid the nastier creatures out there. Like him, the scavengers were very much on the bottom rung of the killing ladder. Moving from cover to cover as he kept out of sight, the thief kept as fast a pace as he dared while keeping a wary ear out. The mournful breeze, almost like sad and distant whistling, had him biting his lip as he darted a look past the twisted iron rib and found the passage clear of lemures.

He had a hard time watching out for enemies with that fucking clatter bending his ear, and out here surprise might well mean death.

He darted out anyway, feet light on the wet sand, keeping his head low. On both sides of the makeshift causeway curved ribs of rusted iron curled towards him like a jaw about to snap closed. A slice of pale Orrery light cut through the causeway, a toothy grin, and the thief’s steps turned into a slide as he caught sight of movement – to the left, in a stray pile of metal spikes. Black and white flesh. Fuck, he did not dare to speak out loud, and immediately turned to run right.

Towards a dune from which an iron rib peeked out. He needed to slide past the top of the sand, into another causeway, and get as far away as possible before it… His boots were unsteady on the sand but Tristan climbed to the top of the dune, past the crest, ready to stumble down into the other winding causeway as quiet as he could. Gods, he shuddered, that thing he’d glimpsed had looked like a-

Thin, translucent strings in the air like a net right ahead of him. Almost invisible to the eye.

He tried to pull back but he’d already been moving down – the corner of his cloak still caught on the edge of the string as he turned, a piece of black cloth fluttering through the floor as the net sliced through it like butter. Oh no. Tristan swallowed. A heartbeat of silence, then a chittering screech from ahead.

Shuttle-spider.

“Oh,” Fortuna breathed. “You really shouldn’t have done that.”

Heart pounding, he scurried back up the dune. Tumbling down the sandy slope without any pretense of quiet – to find the thing he’d glimpsed out in the spikes had come out.

It looked like a pale woman’s face, dark hair stringy and features slightly off, until you noticed the eight spindly legs jutting out the sides. Then you realized the shuttle-spider’s back was all fur and angles to better hide a multitude globulous black eyes. A spasm of revulsion went through him at the sight and Tristan ran.

There was another one at his back and he was fucked if either of the dog-sized lemures caught him. The fanged mouths shuttle-spiders hid under their trailing ‘hair’ were not venomous, but the monsters spun threads that scarred even iron.

Tristan fled back towards Scraptown, or at least tried to.  Ten steps in, another slice of Orrery light revealed there was a shape slithering along the bottom of the causeway, large and long yet fast as a man striding. The thief caught the glint of light on scales and bit his lip almost until it bled. Shit. The shuttle-spiders were… one atop the dune, eyeing him through eyes like little black fish eggs set in that nauseating ‘face’, while the other was out of sight. Shit, shit he needed to move now.

“Through,” he whimpered, and ran forward.

Down the causeway, and perhaps to his death.

Screeching from behind, almost enough to distract him from the danger ahead: a slender string had been woven across the length of the causeway, ankle-high on a human. The second shuttle-spider had only disappeared to lay one of the lethal traps its kind was known for. He leaped over the string, then panicked when he realized it had woven a second barely a foot ahead. Swallowing bile, Tristan tumbled forward in a roll as the lemure leaped after him.

Rising onto his knees he drew a knife, swinging at the arachnid, but it did not even react – merely waiting until his swing was wide then leaping in. He swung the lantern at it, hitting a leg with a crunch, and flaming oil spilled out through the shutter – the lemure screeched, clawing at itself, and Tristan ran for it again. He shot one last looking behind, catching the other shuttle-spider perched atop an iron rib and leaping down at the monster coming down the causeway.

Tristan got a glimpse of a massive snake down in the sand, of something like a stinger unfolding from its back and impaling the shuttle-spider in flight. Black ichor burst as it let out a screeching death cry, the thief getting the fuck out of there before he joined it.

Eyes ever moving as he watched out for nets, Tristan ran until the fear of finding worse ahead rose to match that of what he had left behind. His heart beat wildly, hammering at his ears, and that fucking eerie wind just wouldn’t stop. He hid behind a sheet of metal that rose from a dune like a fin, breath labored, until his hands slowed in their shaking. That had been much, much too close for comfort.

“Fortuna?” he croaked out.

“Nothing’s close,” she whispered into his ear.

He clenched, even knowing she had not done it to unsettle him.

“Shuttle-spiders are extremely territorial,” he panted, eyes still wide. “There’s no way two of them should be nesting so close.”

The whole Murk knew that story about how the Menor Mano had figured it could use the monsters as a way to get rid of bodies cheaper than pigs but the moment they’d added a second shuttle-spider to the pit the creatures went wild and shredded half a house killing each other.

“Maybe those two have shared interests,” Fortuna suggested. “Like knitting, or eating dead bodies.”

Wanting to strangle her was welcome relief from the panic still clouding his mind. He calmed, one breath at a time, and knew from the sweat trickling down his back that the rosemary scent was good as gone.

“There are too many out here,” he said. “We’re barely halfway through the scrapyard, I’ll never make it to the tower.”

“Talk the rest of the Thirteenth into coming with you,” Fortuna suggested. “With enough guns and swords, you could-”

“Or simply come during the silver hours,” he sharply interrupted. “I don’t need help, I need to get out of here before something eats me.”

“That too,” the goddess conceded.

He got up. Too much time had been wasted already. Tristan still had a notion of where he was relative to Scraptown, so beginning the trek back as simply a matter of finding a causeway that did not look like a death trap. It took a bit of heading further west, keeping to the shadow of scraps.

“Huh, another one.”

Tristan’s steps paused as he turned to Fortuna. The goddess was leaning next to a small mound of red sand. At first he thought she was staring down at the ground, but then he made out a thin metal rod. So thin, he saw when he knelt by it, that wire might be a more accurate description than rod if not for the rigidity on display.

At the tip of it there was a slight swell in the form of a flower with a hole where the pistil would be. Raising his lantern and leaning closer, Tristan saw the remains of some kind of mineral powder still at the bottom. Like salt, only yellow.

“You’ve seen those before?” he asked.

“This must be the tenth tonight,” Fortuna idly said. “Whoever put them there has fine taste.”

He frowned at her.

“Why’s that?”

“They smell quite fragrant,” the goddess said.

The thief sniffed at the metal flower, though not too closely. He did not know what those yellow remnants were. All he smelled was wet sand and iron, though.

“Does this one still smell?” he asked.

She shrugged.

“Not as much as the others, but yes,” Fortuna said.

“I’ll be damned,” Tristan whispered. “Someone out there must think this place isn’t enough of a graveyard, because this looks to me like lemure bait.”

“Are you calling me a lemure?” Fortuna coldly said.

He waved a dismissive hand.

“Aether bait, if you prefer,” he said.

“Divine bait,” she insisted. “Grand divine bait.”

Ignoring her increasingly loud complaints, he frowned down at the device. Was such bait why two shuttle-spiders had nested so closely? Maybe. Something to consider, should he get his hands on a teratology book at some point. What he’d thought to be notches on the rod turned out to be letters when he felt them out, fortunately enough in Antigua.

Bouquet Number 9.

It seemed to the thief that there would only be so many people interested in stirring the pot out here and even fewer who’d be capable of pulling off this kind of trick without getting killed: whoever that teacher in the tower was, they had a vicious streak.

Either way it didn’t change his immediate situation. He asked Fortuna to mention it if she came across another of those flower rods and hurried back to Scraptown. The journey back was not quite harrying at the one out, if only because the earlier ruckus seemed to have drawn quite a few lemures to it – they must be fighting over each other’s corpses. Knowing this was to be a short-lived opening, Tristan rolled the dice and chose speed over discretion.

There were a few close calls with shades, but when he got close to town they dared not continue to chase him.

The guards on duty cared little for his exhaustion, demanding details about the lemures he’d encountered out there, and the sergeant leading the interrogation declared him lucky to have survived that snake he’d glimpsed in the distance.

“That’s a cerastan,” he said. “They can track by heat for the better part of a mile, you’re lucky it snatched another kill first.”

As a reward for his report the watchmen waved his dormitory fee for the night, which was a pleasant surprise. Tristan crept into the large room full of beds, trying not to wake anyone, and found there was only one more person inside.

That surprise was a great deal pleasant: Cressida Barboza lay asleep in a corner of the room, or at least she looked like she was sleeping.

There were only so many reasons for her to be out here, and without her brigade to boot. That girl reeked of Mask, and that meant he had competition. Tristan claimed the furthest possible bed and kept his knife and blackjack at hand just in case.

He woke up at five in the morning to find her bed was empty and her bag gone, as if he’d imagined her ever being there.

—

The journey was tense, as much for the memory of the close shaves last night as the constant looking over his shoulder for Cressida, but Tristan made good time going to the tower. He reached the foot of the shrines when Vanesa’s watch marked the time as precisely two minutes before the seventh hour.

The shrines had returned, just as Hage promised, and two-thirds of the tower with them. Interestingly enough, the ball bearings he’d placed where the shrines were not yesterday had not gone missing: he found them half a hundred feet from the shrines, lying in the dirt. So when the shrines return, they push off whatever is occupying the space where they’re supposed to be.

“Which means the transition between ‘there’ and ‘not’ has a physical aspect to it,” Tristan said out loud. “It’s not a matter of ‘always there, but not always accessible’. Something physical happens.”

Fortuna yawned, which was purely for effect considering the goddess could not tire.

“And we care because…”

“If I’m in there when the silver light ends,” Tristan said, “something that affects my physical body will happen. It’s not like entering a layer.”

At least not like the way Maryam had explained layers to them, which was as some sort of aether-place for souls, your body entering on one end and exiting the other without ever physically being inside. If he asked her about this she might have some notion of- he bit the inside of his cheek. He was not crawling back to that cottage without a win, something to stand on. He would not.

“I told you the aether is thin around here, not thick,” Fortuna said. “There is some kind of machine at work.”

“It could have been both,” Tristan absent-mindedly replied.

Had he more time he’d want to get a caged bird and put it inside one of the shrines then come back the day after to see what happened to it, but that would take too long. He could not afford to skip classes forever even for covenant work. Shaking his head, the thief tightened the pack on his back.

“Come on,” he told his goddess. “Time to see what’s in that shrine.”

The climb up a fallen stretch of pipe to climb the one still feeding into the shrine had not changed in the slightest, though now when standing in the dark the thief lit a lantern. A stretch of bronze pipe continued into the distance with nary a speck of dust in sight. There was a slight wind here, heading inwards. Still careful even for the lack of visible dangers, Tristan advanced. It was not a long walk to the end of the pipe which was a grid in the same bronzelike metal as the pipe.

The squares were large enough for him to put an arm through and certainly large enough to peer at the room through. The light revealed a small room going above and below the height of the pipes, bronze everywhere without so much as a window.

“I’m not seeing a way through,” Tristan admitted. “Fortuna?”

The goddess stepped through the grid with her head raised high, then dropped out of sight with an echoing chuckle.

“There’s a door down here,” she called out. “And the grid isn’t welded. There are pop seals on the left and hinges on the right.”

He could fit his arm up to the shoulder through the squares, so after some blind groping it was easy enough to find the pop seals – essentially bronze corks wedged into a hole – and pull them out. Tristan pocketed them and opened the grid, chasing back the shadows with lantern light as he peered down over the edge of the pipe. The entire room seemed like a pressure chamber of some sort, but there were ladder rungs down to the bottom and Fortuna was standing by a vaguely square door kept shut by a pop seal on every corner.

 He hung the lantern on his belt and climbed down, nodding his thanks at the goddess. The bottom floor had on it what he would have called pockmarks, if not for the way they were perfectly spaced and even. Holes of some sort, but filled? Either way, none was larger than an inch so he wasn’t getting out through them. Best to have at the door. Those pop seals took a lot more work, the bronze ‘corks’ each thick as a fist and needing both his hands to be ripped out. Even when he’d taken out all four, though, the door remained closed.

“Already a dead end?” Fortuna said, sounding amused. “That didn’t take long.”

Tristan brought up the lantern and had a closer look at the seals. Ah! As he’d suspected, there was still bronze in the hole. The bottom end of a seal, facing him.

“There’s pop seals on the other side too,” he told her. “But if I’m right…”

He laid a boot on the door and unceremoniously pushed. For a second he was simply struggling, but then sweetness: with a sound like the intake of breath, the bronze door fell out.

“Fluke,” Fortuna accused.

“I did a hand-to-hand lesson in Warfare,” Tristan bragged.

By the sound the door had made falling, they were above ground but not significantly so. Putting the lantern through revealed a square chamber maybe two dozen feet long. Bare stone walls with some furnishings, and it had that cold crypt smell to it. No movement, so after a second look Tristan pulled the lantern back in. He got out his rope, tied it to the bottom rung of the ladder and climbed down it.

There was a door in the back, stone on stone, but no obvious lock or handle. It would keep, though, so first he combed through the room itself. Seen from the outside, the bronze ‘room’ he had been in revealed itself to be some sort of cistern. A tank, if a large one, though somehow he doubted it’d ever held water. The holes he had seen on the floor matched identical ones on the bottom outside and beneath them a bronze receptacle waited.

No doubt there was some sort of respectable name for it, but to Tristan it looked pretty much like a tub.

The walls were bare stone, but not unadorned: they were hard to make out in the lantern light, but near every inch of them was covered in thick stripes of cryptoglyphs. Four elaborate seats of that same bronze alloy face the wall with the tank, tables of pale sculpted stone so fine it looked like lace before them, but what drew his eye was the thick metal pillar to the left of the apparatus he’d climbed down from. It went from floor to ceiling, about a foot wide, and was a mess of cogs, levers and empty glass balls.

One lever in particular had a small panel hanging off it, and he frowned as he approached. No, he had not gone made: something was written on it. Several somethings, in fact. Spelled out in Antigua was a short sentence, and though he could not read the other languages – Umoya, Centzon, Cathayan and Samratrava – he’d bet it was the same thing all around.

“Pull to move on,” he read out loud.

“So pull it,” Fortuna shrugged. “Maybe it opens that door.”

Skeptical, instead the thief went to study the door in question. As he’d seen earlier, there was no lock or handle. For all he knew it was not even truly a door, only a door-shaped indent. Certainly the stone of the door and walls were identical, with no opening that let air through. Maybe the cryptoglyphs around had instructions, but there was no Francho around to translate them for him.

His eyes returned to that suspicious lever.

Fortuna made chicken noises, which he elected to take as a vote in favor of pulling. As it was an obvious trap, and likely the work of the same soul that’d planted monster bait out in the scrapyard, Tristan pulled a ball of twine from his bag. He made a knot around the lever, then carefully unwound it until he was as far back as he could – near one of the seats. He pulled up a cloth around his face, breathed in and then pulled at the string. The lever lowered, something metallic clenching into place, and the not-pockmarks in the floor of the tank above opened.

A heartbeat later, the bottom of the pillar exploded.

Metal shards sprayed everywhere, Tristan throwing himself behind the chair with his coat pulled over his head, and blackpowder smoke billowed out. He coughed, batting at the air, and stayed in cover for a dull minute before peeking out.

“Pull to move on,” Fortuna chortled, leaning against the wrecked pillar with her arms crossed. “That’s funny, it is.”

Tristan could think of no indictment more damning than her compliment, so he was spared the effort of looking for a curse creative enough to answer this. If he’d pulled the lever by hand, that explosion would have shredded his torso like it was paper. The thief gingerly rose to his feet, patting his cloak, and watched as the last of the smoke thinned.

Revealing a trickle falling down from the tank above.

Through one of the floor holes a deep blue liquid was leaking, only that could not be. Tristan had been in that tank and there had been no liquid, or opening for it to come from somewhere else. There’d been two ways in: the pipe and the hatch. He crept closer to the falling liquid, watching as it fell into the large bronze tub below, and frowned when he noticed something was off. The blue substance made no sound, and it was almost too visible – like it did not need lantern light to be seen.

He picked up a ball bearing and tossed it at the stream, eyed widening when it sailed through entirely unimpeded.

“That’s not liquid, it’s light,” Tristan breathed out.

“Eh,” Fortuna said. “Maybe. It’s aether too, sort of.”

“What does that mean?” he asked.

“It’s like what that gaudy thing upstairs is vomiting everywhere,” she elaborated.

“You mean the Grand Orrery,” he stated, half a question.

“This place is tied to it, somehow,” the Lady of Long Odds agreed. “Though it’s broken. I expect that old machine in the sky is too.”

He cocked his head to the side, considering that.

“Why do they want light in a tub?” Tristan wondered.

“Nobody wants light in a tub,” Fortuna said, rolling her eyes. “Tubs are for people.”

A pause.

“You could do with using them more, you know.”

The thief ignored that, watching the blue light slowly filling the bronze tub. At this rate it’d take days to fill the thing, but maybe the pipe he’d come in through had been meant to change that back in the machine’s heyday. He could no more understand the workings of the wonders left behind by the Ancients than a fly could understand poetry. On the other hand, he could try to make sense of the way this place had been built.

“I think this might be the aether equivalent of a water mill,” Tristan slowly said. “This room, the tank and the pipes – they brought in the ‘water’ that made the rest of this shrine work.”

“It doesn’t work, demonstrably,” Fortuna drawled.

“It wouldn’t, the pipes fell off,” he replied. “Look at that flow from the tank – it can’t even fill the tub, much less bring in enough pressure for the whole shrine. And if even the doors here worked on the aether machine too…”

“None of them will open,” the goddess completed.

“Which means I can’t access the rest of the shrine through broken pipes,” Tristan said. “I need to figure out how to open one of those still-working gates from the outside or I won’t be getting anywhere.”

Which meant this was a dead end. Still, he could pick up the work when he was back outside. Tristan carefully used the string and a cutout to pull up the lever back up in case there was a second explosion trap, but his caution proved unnecessary. The blue light stopped flowing, and when he climbed the rope back up into the tank there was no trace it’d ever passed through. In a matter of minutes he’d exited the pipe, landing atop the fallen one.

Which was when he heard a shrine gate open.

It was pure luck that had him in the right position to spy on it: from the top of the fallen pipe, he could see the tall shrine door wind open with sudden jerks. For three heartbeats they stayed open and empty, enough Tristan began to wonder if his fussing about inside another shrine had somehow caused this, but then a man in Watch black walked out.

He looked around cautiously, the thief pressing himself down against the pipe to stay out of sight, then the stranger disappeared back into the shrine. Mere moments later he walked out with a large cloth bag, which he reached in with thickly gloved hands. There was an odd sound, bits of metal on stone, and the man began going around the circle of the shrines at a hurried pace.

It took Tristan a moment to figure out what he was doing: the man was sowing caltrops.

The stranger wore the coat of a fighting fit so he was no garrison man, and that coat with so many pockets sown on they might as well be another layer. He was dark-skinned in the Malani way, tall and twitchy though his movements were methodical as he went around trapping the grounds. Broken nose and brown eyes, the sides of his head shaved while neat cornrows went down to his nape. He had maybe a foot or two on Tristan, but he was skinny enough the thief doubted he was all that strong.

It was only when he came closer to Tristan’s hiding place that the gray-eyed man caught a glimpse of elaborated colored beads around his neck – from Uthukile, then, or at least wearing markings in the style of the Low Isle. The thief would not be able to tell real Uthukile beads from fakes but it hardly mattered here.

Staying on his perch, lantern snuffed out, Tristan watched as the man liberally sprinkled the grounds with those nasty little pieces. There was strategy at work, the thief saw: they were spread on the paths nears the gates of the shrines, usually in parts shaded by the pipes and pillars. The Malani only stopped when the bag was empty, and even then he was not done.

He disappeared back into the shrine, running out moments later as the gates began to jerk closed. When those metal jaws snapped shut, the Malani fitted the gate with a tripwire and what looked like it might be some sort of powder bomb. So he doesn’t know the shrine disappears during the afternoon, or doesn’t care. Apparently pleased with his work, the Malani then spent a solid ten minutes making chalk markings on the ground in front of the gates before hoisting his pack and beating a retreat.

Tristan waited until the stranger was well out of sight before shimmying down. Careful with his steps, he went to snatch one of the caltrops and found it to be little more than bent nails welded together. Simple, but still like as not to go through a lemure’s paw if they stepped on it – or the sole of a boot, for that matter. The trap on the shrine gate had a simple trigger, but taking a closer look at the powder bomb had Tristan frowning.

The string pull was straightforward enough, but the dangerous part looked like some sort of grenade that’d been tinkered with. Not the sort of thing just anyone could get their hands on, or know how to use.

Likely he was not only dealing with a Mask but with one who had ties to a Tinker. That could get troublesome. Though he was rather curious about what might lie behind that gate, he was not confident in disarming the trap and while triggering it from a distance might work the noise would likely attract lemures – and reveal he’d snooped besides. No, he’d learned enough for the morning.

He needed to retreat, mull over his approach and grab a bite. Besides, he needed to swing by the cottage come afternoon to drop another letter – or maybe simply add a fresh mark to the last one, should it still be around. That and he had a shift at the Chimerical in a few hours.

Tristan made his way back to Scraptown, and from there returned dockside. Looking around Regnant Avenue for something cheap to eat had him stumbling into a hole-in-the-wall shop at the end of an alley, from which the distinct aroma of more than halfway decent paella wafted.

There were barely three tables insides, but the meal cost him mere coppers while the plate was groaningly full – and, the older man running the shop proudly told him, the shrimps were freshly caught. It wasn’t the classic Sacromonte dish, they’d used artichokes even if the saffron was just right, but it was still a taste of home that had him digging in enthusiastically. By far the best meal he’d had since leaving the City.

Tristan was no fool, so he’d picked the table with its back to the wall and an eye on the door. That made it all the more galling when he did not see Cressida Barboza until she slid into the seat across this. Though still in her coat and tunic with pinned back hair, the hat had changed. A broad, black beret with silver framework and a small feather angled downwards.

“Abrascal,” Lady Cressida greeted him.

Casually, he reached for his pistol and pointed it at her under the table. Only the tip touched something solid. They frowned at each other.

“Pistol?” she asked.

He nodded.

“Pistol?”

She shrugged.

“Seemed prudent, after yesterday,” Cressida said.

Tristan hummed, picked up a fork with his free hand and took a bite of his paella. He chewed as loudly and obnoxiously as possible.

“How many hats can you possibly own?” Tristan finally asked, squinting as he kept the pistol level.

“About as many as you have fleas,” she replied without missing an eye, which he had to admit was solid. “You’ve been sniffing around the tower.”

He took another bite of paella, swallowed.

“I got curious,” Tristan said. “What’s it to you?”

“I was there first,” Lady Cressida flatly replied. “And that neighborhood getting crowded.”

He made his brow raise.

“How so?” Tristan asked.

“Don’t pretend,” she scoffed. “You saw that Uthukile bastard setting up his traps. Silumko.”

This time it was no lie when his brow rose. There was no way for her to know that, unless…

“You were there,” he said. “How?”

“The trick,” Cressida said, fingers creeping towards his paella, “is that I am better than you in every way.”

He cocked the pistol under the table. The creeping hand paused.

“If you steal the only decent shrimp I’ve had since leaving the City,” Tristan blandly said, “we are going to have trouble.”

The hatchet-faced woman squinted at him, then sighed. The hand withdrew.

“Stingy.”

“Get your own,” he said, and shoveled in a large mouthful out of spite.

“But then I’d have to stop buying hats,” she idly replied.

The laugh that startled out of him had him choking on the paella, dropping his fork to cough into his fist, and he glared at the innocently smiling noblewoman. That had not been accidental timing.

“I’m not spending the rest of my meal holding a gun,” Tristan said afterwards, voice still a little rough. “Pistols on the table, on three?”

“Agreed,” Cressida replied.

He counted down to three. Neither pistol moved.

“Worth a shot,” he admitted, somewhat proud at the pun. “All right, then. How can I be rid of you most quickly?”

“The trapper, Silumko, he’s working with someone else,” she said. “I think they know about the places.”

The what now? Tristan hummed thoughtfully, putting on a thinking face.

“That complicates things,” he replied.

A heartbeat passed. Cressida cursed.

“You didn’t know about the places.”

“No,” Tristan admitted, “but now this conversation’s now growing on me. Continue.”

“Most of the Mask instructors only take up to three students,” the noblewoman said. “Rumor is someone’s already made it into the tower, so…”

“Only two are left,” he completed. “You believe they’re working to keep everyone away until they’ve figured out how to enter the tower proper.”

Hence the traps. Tristan had thought they seemed more apt for catching men than lemures.

“Congratulations, you now know the things I told you,” Cressida drily replied. “I’ll cut to the chase – unless your Warfare class has been a tortured charade, you’re not much of a fighter. If you face them alone, they’ll roll you.”

So that was her angle. On the surface, it was a sensible offer. Cressida knew he was interested in the tower, and she could have tried to recruit another Mask if she knew one but that would have meant spreading knowledge of this whole affair around. He was the only ally on the table, from a certain perspective.

The perspective of someone who really wanted to get into that tower, that was.

Otherwise why would she be talking about getting into a fight instead of getting around this pair or even simply moving on to greener pastures? No, Cressida Barboza knew something about what waited inside that tower and she was hungry for it. Tristan took another bite of his paella, savoring the taste as much as making the noblewoman wait.

“What’s taught inside?” he casually asked, watching her face.

Flickers – surprise, anger, and then put-on confusion. She opened her mouth, but Tristan clicked his tongue in irritation.

“Tell me,” he said, “or this conversation is at an end.”

Her jaw clenched.

“You’re a high-handed little prick, aren’t you?” she said.

“One whose patience is running out,” Tristan replied. “So what’ll it be, Barboza?”

She drew back, breathed out. Smoothed away the anger.

“Deicide,” Lady Cressida said. “My source says that’s where the instructor for deicide is.”

His first thought was to dismiss the matter entirely, for he had little interest in such things, but the words never passed his lips. Because that wasn’t entirely true, was it? Perhaps the general art was of little interest, but the particular? Tristan had learned a name on the Dominion, the last on his List. The Almsgiver.

A god’s name.

It was the thief’s turn to lean back, studying the hard woman across from him. Her face was a bland mask, but the way she held herself was not so controlled. Tense shoulders, leaning in, fingers just a little too crisp – like she was trying not to clench them. This whole affair had weight for her. Enough that she was unlikely to turn on him unless it helped her get one of those places.

Tristan disarmed the pistol under the table, then set it down beside his bowl.

“You have my attention,” he said. “Keep talking.”

# Chapter 27

As far as plans went, it had the virtue of simplicity.

“So we’re going to rob the man,” Tristan amusedly said.

“Politely,” Cressida insisted. “He knows how to open one of the gates, you saw it just as I did. In the morning he always goes without that Someshwari girl he’s made a deal with, so we can grab him and get him to talk.”

“By robbing him,” Tristan reminded her, lips twitching. “Are you sure I’m the rat here?”

“The smell does not lie,” Cressida Barboza replied without batting an eye.

Damn. She just kept nailing those, but he wasn’t going to stop. One of these days she’d miss a step and it would make finally getting one over her all the sweeter. Though both of them agreed that their target was unlikely to return to the tower today, they agreed to meet up at Scraptown by six of the evening.

“I couldn’t find out anything about the Someshwari, but Silumko belongs to the Twenty-Ninth Brigade,” Cressida said. “I’ve never seen one of the other cabalists follow him to Scraptown but best to keep an eye out for them anyway.”

“You followed him around as well, I take it,” Tristan mused.

“We all have things we’re good at,” the noblewoman replied, then looked him up and down. “Presumably.”

“Like pickpocketing,” the thief smiled. “Not a skill I expected from you, Lady Cressida.”

“Met a lot of noble girls, have you?” Cressida smiled back, just as falsely.

More than most rats, he figured, at least since the Dominion. Not that he intended to tell her as much.

“Did House Barboza have a rough few years, perhaps?” Tristan ‘sympathetically’ asked.

She cupped her hand around her ear.

“Do you hear that?” Cressida replied. “The sound of how close I’m getting to pulling a knife, I mean.”

“Just making conversation,” Tristan lied.

If he recalled correctly, Professor Iyengar had marked her as being ‘Lusitanian’ during the first Mandate class. He’d never heard of such a people before, but the word sounded vaguely Lierganen. Something to look into if he could find a source of information. Like, say, an ancient devil from a conspiracy obsessed with secrets he was headed to do underpaid labor for. As if sensing something Lady Cressida Barboza narrowed her dark eyes at him.

“The trouble with digging too deep, Abrascal, is that it makes a grave for people to push you into,” she warned.

Ah, Tristan thought with a pleasant smile, but that was only a problem if you’d never learned how to dig your way out.

—

“So where are Lusitanians from?”

Hage’s brows rose. It was the devil’s favorite facial expression, which he used often and to great effect – they were mighty impressive eyebrows, Tristan had to concede, and well taken care of. He was coming to suspect the devil brushed and waxed them regularly.

“Do I look like an atlas to you, boy?” Hage asked.

“You’re not anywhere that useful,” the thief agreed.

“If you want more than insults, make it worth my while,” the devil said.

Tristan did not even hesitate, knowing exactly the sort of coin his teacher was after.

“I’ve struck a pact with Lady Cressida Barboza to work together to get into the hidden tower,” he said. “Robbery might be involved, in a polite sort of way.”

Satisfied with the information offered, Hage nodded.

“Lusitania,” he said, “was one of the southernmost Sitiadas.”

Tristan let out a whistle. When the Second Empire fell, entire swaths of its heartlands had been swallowed by the Gloam in a matter of days when the Thirteenth Betrayal swept through the cradle of the empire. Yet if only those lands were lost Liergan might have recovered – not as an empire ruling the world, perhaps, but some kingdom match for the great powers of the modern nights.

Only the catastrophe had not stopped, invasions and civil wars ravaging the lands now called Old Liergan until only remnants were left. As the Succession Wars stretched on, the entire southern half of the continent was lost to the dark save for a few fortified holdouts: the Sitiadas. Small pockets of Glare surrounded by hollow kingdoms and mad gods, ever teetering on the edge of annihilation.

“Was. What happened to it?”

“It fell in 71 Sails,” Hage said. “You did not buy much with imprecise gossip, but I will add this: that entire affair was tied to the first muster of the Watch in over a century.”

“I don’t know what that is,” Tristan admitted.

“A call,” Hage said, “for every garrison, free company and Watch ally within a year’s travel of the source to mobilize their full strength and march there as fast as they can.”

So the sort of calamity causing nightmares for the rest of one’s life. Only Cressida Barboza could not have been born in Lusitania before it fell, unless she wore her twenty-nine years of age very discreetly. Most likely she’d been born in exile, her family fallen on hard times after becoming refugees. That was an angle that could be worth-

“Mephistopheline got into the cream again,” Hage idly said. “Best get out the bucket and soap, he threw up particularly sticky.”

Later, sadly. Tristan shot a betrayed look at the guilty party, who flopped belly up in formal denial of having slapped a cream bottle off the shelf so he could lap up too much of it and spew it into a corner. For the third time in two weeks.

“Mrow,” Mephistopheline tried, advancing a case of pure happenstance.

“I don’t even know how you keep getting up there,” Tristan muttered, pulling back his sleeves. “You’re like a fat anvil, there’s no way you can make that jump.”

And to mop up vomit he went. A Mask’s work was never done.

—

Meeting at Scraptown, they prepared thoroughly for tomorrow.

Secondday would be Saga class, which Tristan was sad to miss, but needs must. In truth neither expected subduing the Malani to be all that difficult, it was not missing him before he disappeared into the shrine that was the real obstacle. Silumko, Cressida told him, had arrived at Scraptown around seven for the past two days. He always came from the south, going around the forest by a wide margin. He then bought breakfast at one of the shops in the fortified town, washed his hands in the well and headed out to the tower.

She had written all this down in a small booklet in neat handwriting, which Tristan struggled not to find endearing.

“He has some sort of silver gyroscope he uses to navigate the scrapyard,” Cressida added. “I’m not sure what it does, but I’ve never seen him get anywhere near a lemure.”

“So we follow after him,” Tristan said.

He’d not mind riding the man’s coattails twice in a day, if they had room to fit him.

“It’d be best to only grab him while he’s at the foot tower,” she agreed. “Otherwise we’ll have to carry him. I have restraints to put him in – do you have a weapon that shouldn’t kill him by accident?”

Implying she did not. Something to remember.

“A blackjack,” the thief replied. “He didn’t look like much of a fighter, if we take him by surprise I like our odds.”

“He carries at least two grenades on him,” Cressida warned. “We get only one chance at doing this clean.”

They agreed on three hand signals – attack, wait and retreat – and to set up a watch for the night, one of them always staying awake to keep an eye on the front gate. They simply could not afford to miss Silumko, as if he reached the inside of the shrine he would be beyond their reach until he deigned to leave. Assuming he did not simply find the way into the tower and leave them behind. Having only taken a quick look at the shrine gates, the thief made inquiries.

“They are kept closed by some kind of aether lock,” the noblewoman said. “He’s got some silvery tools that let him work it, but lockpicks don’t do anything.”

“Ever go inside the shrine?” he asked.

She shook her head.

“Tried through the pipes, but there’s grids,” Cressida said.

“On pop seals,” he said. “It’s possible to get through – and our potential teacher certainly did, because the inside of the one I visited had a trap laid.”

She eyed him, reluctantly impressed and entirely unwilling to acknowledge it.

“You couldn’t get further in?”

“I think it’s an aether machine that controls the doors,” Tristan said, “and if the pipes are broken it no longer works. Any shrine I could get into that way would be a dead end from the start.”

“The shrine Silumko’s working has unbroken pipes,” Cressida noted. “That lends some credence to your theory. How sure are you the teacher’s the one who laid the trap?”

“Unless our Malani friend hangs up taunting notes with his traps, it’s not his work,” Tristan said.

Cressida seemed pensive.

“Between that and the flower rods, it seems almost too harsh a test,” she said. “I cannot help but feel we are missing something.”

“I don’t know about that,” Tristan said, “but here’s the thing about those flower rods: the salts in them fade. Which means someone has to be placing them out there regularly. And if neither of us saw anything during day hours…”

“Then odds are it was done during the night,” Cressida finished. “That’s… Doing it once might be possible, with some luck, but regularly? Even a veteran would balk at trying.”

The lemures out there were no joke, as he had personally found out.

“Either our teacher’s not afraid of lemures, or they have a way to avoid them,” Tristan agreed.

Considering they were Krypteia and not Skiritai, the latter seemed far more likely. By the hour’s turn they had the outline of a plan ready and some contingencies for the most likely disasters, but there was one area that Tristan thought unfortunately vague.

“You really don’t know anything about the Someshwari?” he pressed.

“She only came once, last sixthday, but she spent an hour around the tower and ran into Silumko while he was on his way there. They spoke and looked like they came to terms. As far as I know she has not come to Scraptown since.”

“He has a lot of toys, the way you tell it,” Tristan noted. “Could be she’s providing tools or funds in exchange for a seat in the class when he has a way in.”

“That is my guess as well,” Cressida said, “but it is only a guess.”

He let the subject go at that, instead letting the conversation change to the watch shifts for keeping an eye on the front gate. Yet in the back of his mind, wheels were spinning. One meeting, the appearance of alliance and some guesswork. It was a thin foundation to the belief the other Masks were in accord. Besides, Silumko was usually alone by the tower and did not seem like a trained warrior, which Cressida definitely was: she had a sword and the right calluses for someone knowing how to use it.

She could do this alone. It would be riskier, certainly, and that was reason enough to bring Tristan in. But that was a safety, a surplus. Not a necessity, and so not a match for the eagerness to make common cause with him she had displayed back in that paella shop.

So what was she not telling him?

—

Silumko of the Twenty-Ninth Brigade strolled through the front gates of Scraptown at precisely seven hours and four minutes, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and that sown-up fighting coat.

They went ahead while the Malani bought his usual apple bread at the street stand, leaving through the back gate and hiding out in the scrapyard where they had a good line of sight on the exit. Moments later he was heading out, a large bag hoisted on his back and a musket as well. He’d not had that yesterday. The Malani moved surefooted, but not quite as warily as he should have: following him was child’s play.

Every minute or so he pulled out that silvery gyroscope Cressida had mentioned, staring at it for a few seconds and sometimes sharply changing direction. Then, about halfway to the tower, he headed straight left without even eyeing his device first.

The pair were puzzled but knew better than to speak out here, instead following as closely as they could. Tristan had not been sure what to expect, but it was not what they found: a trapped shade. A beartrap buried under the rusty sand had caught it by the leg, and though it did not seem in a great deal of pain neither had it been able to flee.

The tall lemure looked thin in the morning’s silver light, like a rattling scarecrow, and lashed out angrily when Silumko approached it. The Malani put down his pack and went rifling through it. He took out a ball of rags, removing from them three glass vials. Two were full of translucent liquids, the third empty and larger. With deft fingers the man mixed some of the liquid from the two vials in the third, corking them all afterwards and putting them all away save for the mix – which he shook, then uncorked before throwing at the shade vial and all.

What a waste of good glass.

“Poison?” Cressida murmured.

It was more silent than the musket, the thief thought, if Silumko wanted a quiet kill. But Tristan was unconvinced and turned out correct in his suspicions. It seemed as if Cressida might have been right when the shade, at first shrieking in displeasure, settled down and after five minutes ceased moving entirely. Only Silumko undid the bear trap and took shackles and a muzzle out of his bag. He fitted them on the shade and tied a makeshift harness of rope before putting it on.

The Malani let out a loud sigh, then set out with the lemure dragged behind him.

“Well,” Tristan drily said when he was out of sight, “that’ll certainly make him easier to follow.”

Not only had Silumko slowed down significantly he was leaving a literal trail behind.

“What does he need the shade for?” Cressida wondered/

Tristan did not know, but if he had to guess? It must be related to why the Malani could get into the shrine but evidently not yet the tower. The flower rods, are they there as more than a way to make the journey dangerous? If a lemure was necessary to beat some sort of puzzle, it only made sense to make trapping them easier. Too early to tell if it was a coincidence.

Following the Malani the rest of the way proved almost triflingly easy. And it had other benefits besides: Silumko now consulted his gyroscope so often he did not even bother to put the silvery tool back into the back afterwards, and though the path was winding they did not so much as glimpse another lemure. Once they’d reached the stone grounds around the shrine they had to let the man pull ahead a bit, given the sparser options to hide.

Thankfully, he had to drag a shade up a set of stairs so he was a tad distracted.

The pair circled to the left, moving from pillar to pillar in the shade of the pipes. It took longer than Tristan would have liked and was unfortunately tricky besides: the caltrops the Malani had laid yesterday kept forcing them to make detours. Tristan was starting to wonder if the point of them might have been to flush out anyone creeping up rather than catching the unaware.

Either way, within a few minutes they were in position. There was a collapsed section of pipe on the ground angled so that you could not see the inside entirely from near the shrine gate, he and Cressida stood in wait inside. About a dozen seconds later Silumko dropped the harness and leaned forward, hands on his knees. Panting and red-faced. The Malani was not as tall as Tristan had first thought – not even a full foot taller, the thief assessed now that he was closer.

The gray-eyed man cocked an eyebrow at Cressida, reaching for his blackjack, and she nodded. Bet get it over with now. A load moan stopped them cold.

Silumko started cursing, hastily fleeing from the awoken shade struggling to get out of its bindings. It was flailing ineffectively but the Mask still panicked, tripping on his own bag and groaning as his musket dug into his side. The two of them waited for a full minute while the Malani struggled to open his pack and mix his brew again before tossing the vial at the wriggling lemure. Tristan would admit, in the privacy if his mind, that he was starting to feel better about their odds rolling the man without trouble.

“Now,” Cressida murmured.

Only yet again they stopped, as Silumko – back on his feet, managing to look disheveled even with that haircut – had turned towards the stairs and was peering at something attentively. The pair shared a frustrated look and settled to wait. The Malani waved whoever he was looking at closer, and there the complications began. A tall middle-aged blackcloak in regular’s uniform, a Lierganen man with sword and musket, stepped into view. He bore a heavy pack and lieutenant’s stripes on his shoulders.

“Regulars aren’t to intervene in student scuffles,” Cressida murmured.

Tristan scoffed.

“If you believe that, I have a nice manse in Pandemonium to sell you.”

The officer stood there talking with Silumko for a few moments, their voices pitched too quiet to carry, then a decision was reached. The Malani pulled the unconscious lemure closer to the shrine gates even as the watchman put down his own pack and took out a large tin receptacle. He unscrewed it, then produced a broad paintbrush.

With further ado he dipped the paintbrush inside and began tracing a red line of paint. After three strokes, it became clear it was to circle the entirety of the shrines. As if to mark it off limits, one of the few rules enforced on the island. Tristan squinted.

“You ever seen that lieutenant back at Scraptown?” he whispered.

“No,” Cressida whispered back. “But I’m not familiar with all the officers there. That is a real uniform, though.”

“There’s no way the tower’s really off limits,” the thief said. “So I guess the question is…”

“Bribe or fake?” she finished, tone pensive. “While I’m uncertain whether there would be consequences to tracing a false red line for a student, there likely would be for a watchman.”

Tristan hummed.

“If our friend down there had the coin for a bribe large enough to make a lieutenant gamble his rank, I expect he would have no need of making common cause with the Someshwari girl,” he said. “My bet is on fake.”

The cosmetics must be very skillfully applied to fool him even at a distance, but Tristan was not so arrogant as to thinking his eyes were above being tricked.

“Sound about right,” Cressida muttered, then risked a peek. “I should be able to shoot him from here.”

Tristan blinked.

“Pardon?”

“It’s not that hard a shot and he’s moving predictably,” Cressida said.

She sounded like she was wondering whether or not to be insulted.

“That is not the nature of my surprise,” the thief flatly replied. “Even if it’s not a watchman, they are still a student.”

“It’s not like I’ll aim for the head,” she peevishly said. “A leg shot would-”

“Be a death sentence, out here,” Tristan said. “We both know that. Blood and the inability to run? They would never make it back to Scraptown.”

“I thought Sacromontan street rats were cold-blooded killers with butcher’s knives,” Cressida frowned.

He rolled his eyes. Provincials.

“That’s the confederales,” he replied. “Though I understand the butcher knives are mostly symbolic.”

“Your lot chop people’s hands off and hang them upside down to bleed out,” Cressida flatly said. “And now you’re balking at a leg shot?”

“That’s the coteries,” Tristan said. “You’re aiming Murk-wise, at least, but do I look like a legbreaker to you?”

“More like a legbroken,” she sneered. “What even are you, if not those?”

“Unwilling to use murder as a conversation opener,” he replied. “It’s one thing to rough up the Malani for information, another to drop a student without warning. We should try to bargain first.”

“We’d lose the advantage of surprise,” Cressida said.

“The false watchman’s irrelevant, it’s Silumko we need,” he replied. “We can still grab him and take him hostage. I’m guessing whoever that is in lieutenant’s stripes can no more enter the shrine without our Malani friend than we can.”

The noblewoman scoffed.

“I wouldn’t have put out a hand if I’d known you were going to be such a flower about it,” Cressida said.

That had the ring of truth to it, which stung a little but that was a passing thing. He’d come out here for results, not more false comforts. The thief said nothing, simply raising an eyebrow. They both knew she was in too deep to turn back. Even if she fired that shot anyway, nothing forced him to help. He might even prefer to help Silumko subdue her in exchange for the way in.

“Fine,” she groused. “I’ll grab him. Can you run me a distraction, at least?”

“Done,” Tristan replied. “I’ll wait thirty seconds before going in.”

“Make it a full minute,” Cressida grunted.

Tristan crouched down, glancing back long enough to see her disappear into a pillar’s shadow without a sound. His gaze swept the ground as he counted the sixty seconds, finding what he needed and closing his fingers around it. Silumko was unwrapping a leather roll holding silvery tools, eyes on it, while the watchman energetically went about painting red. Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, sixty. Tristan slowly rose, eyed the distance and snapped his wrist.

The loose stone he’d picked up hit the officer right in the back of the head, a real beauty of a peg.

The watchman shouted in pain even as Silumko turned towards him in alarm, but Tristan ended up the most surprised of them all – even as the officer clasped the back of his head, his skin rippled and then burst into smoke. It wafted off in streams, revealing a furious Someshwari girl of the same height and in the same clothes. Contract.

“What the-”

Tristan stepped out of the pipe, drawing their eyes.

“Sorry,” he smiled, making his tone obnoxiously false. “I was cleaning my rock and my hand just sli-”

The Someshwari lowered her musket at him. She was just a few inches shorter than him, he noted, but broader at the shoulders and more muscled. Hair pulled back by beads to bare her forehead and going down the back of her head in curls, gray eyes – darker than his – and thick lips pulled back into an angry snarl.

“Who in the Wheels are you?” she demanded.

“My name,” he gravely said, “is Lord Ferrando Villazar, of House Villazar. You stand in the presence of-”

“Fuck.”

Both their eyes went to the speaker, Silumko, who raised his hands as Cressida stood behind him with a pistol pressed against his throat.

“-a distraction,” Tristan smoothly finished. “And how might I refer to you, my fair lady?”

“Ira,” the Someshwari replied, batting her eyelashes at him. “You’ve fine courtesies, Lord Ferrando, but this seems to me a most unprovoked assault.”

“Nice red paint you brought,” Cressida drily replied. “Musket on the ground, now, or I pop your friend.”

“Please don’t,” Silumko croaked.

That accent was thick as board but mostly intelligible. Definitely from Uthukile, though, good to confirm the beads were no mere pretension.

“You will not shoot him, Barboza,” Ira snorted. “If you could get into the shrine you already would have. He is your way in as well.”

“I brought a lockpicker and the tools are out,” Cressida said. “Try me.”

The Someshwari glanced his way.

“You are a lockpicker?”

“My talents are myriad,” Tristan solemnly replied.

She tittered but those eyes were cold as ice. She flicked a considering glance between them.

“Then if you switch sides, I will pay you double,” Ira said. “It does not matter who gets me in.”

“Ira, you bitch,” Silumko choked out.

He tried to struggle, but Cressida pressed the gun into his neck and that settled him down. Tristan raised an eyebrow.

“You have ten ramas on you?” he asked.

“There is no way she paid you five gold,” Ira haggled.

“Three,” Tristan ‘admitted’. “But I’ll do it for eight.”

“I can do eight,” the Someshwari smiled.

Tristan shrugged at Cressida, as if to say sorry, and turned to face her while sidling closer to Ira. Always keeping an eye on that musket, which had moved a little closer to his accomplice but could still be turned on him in a heartbeat.

“Villazar, you treacherous whore,” Cressida bit out ‘angrily’. “I should have known you’d turn.”

“None of you can get into the tower without me,” Silumko called out, openly panicking. “The aether device inside the shrine is broken and I’m the only one who knows how to jury-rig it.”

“I’m going to take a guess and say it involves strapping that shade into some sinister-looking machine,” Tristan said.

The other man cleared his throat.

“That’s not all it takes,” the Malani defensively replied.

“Go on then, Barboza,” Ira challenged. “Kill him. I imagine breaking one of the few enforced rules on Tolomontera will see you hanged and I can take my time getting that seat afterwards.”

Tristan sought Cressida’s eyes to get an idea of their move here. He was not sure if he could handle Ira in a fight, though odds were he could divest her of her musket at least. He was already clasping his blackjack inside his sleeve, but the thief was not sure the Someshwari would let him get close enough to use it. If he could get a pistol pointed at her back that would make a difference, let them dictate terms to the other two, but it would take- Cressida’s eyes widened, which was the only warning he got.

Ira brandished the musket at him, taking aim, and with a curse Tristan dropped. Only she didn’t pull the trigger, instead swiveling back the way of the other two and then shooting – both Silumko and Cressida ducked low, neither able to see Ira had shot above the standing heights of their head. A fakeout, he realized even as Silumko wriggled out of Cressida’s and broke into a run. Shit, he thought, even as he rose back to his feet and Cressida took a potshot that had Ira ducking behind a pillar.

“I’ll take her,” Cressida shouted, “take the-”

He didn’t listen to the end of the sentence, instead moving to intercept the Malani before he could make it into the scrapyard. The tall man snarled when he realized there was no way out, then reached for his belt as the thief closed the distance. Silumko was quick on the draw, but Tristan was just a second quicker: his blackjack hit the man’s elbow just as he drew his pistol, sending the ornate pearl-incrusted piece clattering to the floor.

The Malani yelped in pain and the thief drew back, angling a blow to the side of the head, but then Ira was on him.

She had turned into an ox of a man, at least seven feet tall and so muscled the sleeve of her uniform burst. Tristan half-ducked out of the blow but her fist still caught the side of his chin and it was like he’d gotten kicked by a horse: his head snapped back and when he next blinked he was on the floor, on his back. Ira, back into her true shape and wafting smoke, was struggling to fend off Cressida’s sword with a dagger and shouting all the while.

Vision swimming, Tristan pushed himself up onto his knees – dimply realizing his hair was free, his cap gone – and saw Silumko was facing him the same way. By the looks of that nasty bruise on his cheek Cressida had sucker punched the Malani with the shell of her guard. Silumko was reaching forward, towards the pistol he had dropped. Which now lay halfway between them.

“Truce,” Tristan offered, discreetly reaching inside his other sleeve. “We can let them fight it out.”

“Indeed,” Silumko said. “Let us not be uncivilized.”

A heartbeat later he tossed his knife as the other Mask threw himself at the pistol, the blade losing itself in the cloth of the coat. Silumko triumphantly raised the pistol but Tristan kicked it out of his hand, the other man shouting angrily before charging him bare-handed. The thief reached for his blackjack, but the Malani punched him before he could aim a blow and the two of them ended up rolling on the floor. Back hitting a pillar, Tristan choked out a curse and elbowed the man in the nose.

“Not the face,” Silumko complained, kneeing him the belly.

“Not the belly then, you prick,” the thief gasped.

He caught the Malani’s wrist as the man tried to punch him in the face again, gouging at the man’s eyes only to miss and claw at his cheek instead. Panicking, Silumko smashed their foreheads – and the angle was horrid. They both rolled away, groaning in pain, and Tristan wrinkled his nose. Was he bleeding? No, the blood on his fingers wasn’t his. The Malani had a nosebleed from that elbow earlier. They both got onto their knees again, legs wobbly, only for Silumko’s eyes to widen as they stared behind him.

“Stop,” the Malani shouted. “STOP. There’s-”

Tristan started running without bothering to look back. Something brushed against the back of his heels, reinforcing the wisdom of that decision, and he almost tripped into Silumko as the man stumbled trying to wheel around.

“BLEMS,” Silumko shouted. “WE DREW BLEMS!”

Tristan risked a glance back and saw a thing of horror. They moved on two feet and they had a man’s shape, roughly, but that too-broad torso bore no neck or head. The headless men had small beady eyes scattered all over their abdomen and a mouth like a crevasse – going down into a jagged stripe, full of sharp teeth and tendrils that looked like stretched-out black tongues.

Gods, Tristan thought as he saw the taller of the blems – almost eight feet tall – suck back in a tendril that’d extended at least a dozen feet out. Gods, that thing was what’d almost grabbed his foot. Silumko had slipped when he stumbled, dropping his hat, and from the whine of pain he’d hurt his leg. Tristan gritted his teeth, dragging him upright and snatching the fallen wide-brimmed hat without thinking about it.

“Move you fool,” he snarled.

“It’s sprained,” Silumko moaned, but move he did.

Tristan hurried, half at a run, but the headless men were so tall and he could feel the ground shake behind them as they caught up, a wet slurp as a tendril extended and, and shrieks as the blems drew back. They’d run into the caltrops, the thief realized with dumb relief.

“How long to open the shrine?” Tristan asked, lengthening his stride. “We can’t lose them by running.”

“Seconds,” Silumko breathed. “I rigged the aether lock, I just need to pop it open.”

Seconds was what they’d earned from the caltrops, as the sting did not distract their pursuers for long. Headless men did not seem like much, compared to some of the lemures out there, but there was a reason they were so feared: the things were basically unkillable. Unless you cut them in half or fired a cannon into them there wasn’t much of anything that would keep them down for long.

“Get him to the door,” Ira shouted, and there was a burst of thunder.

The Someshwari had fired her musket at the lemures, though it would be but a fly’s bite to them. Cressida, the thief saw, was aiming her pistol and gauging the shot. Once they were mere feet away from the tools, Silumko pushed off and pressed something into the thief’s hand.

“Slow them down,” the Malani gasped, reaching for the tools.

Tristan’s fingers closed against a ball of cast iron with a fuse. A grenade. Well, better odds than him landing a shot. He absent-mindedly put on the hat to free his hands and went fumbling for a match, finding and cracking one even as two more shots sounded. Not that the bullets did much more than anger the blems, one haring off after Cressida while the other tried to snatch Ira before she ducked behind a pillar.

That one was closest to the gates, so it was the one Tristan tossed the grenade at.

“GRENADE,” he shouted.

Not quite loudly enough he did not hear a click behind him, Silumko sobbing with relief as the gates began to jerk open. A heartbeat later there was a burst of powder and pale light, both lemures shrieking in pain – when Tristan opened his eyes, colors swimming across his vision, he saw the skin of the monsters looked burned in patches. On the bright side, it made the blems draw back for a moment.

On the less bright side, it woke up the shade and the thing was very angry.

Ira was running to the gate, he saw, and so was Cressida. So it fell to him, damn it, if they wanted to get anywhere inside. Tristan grabbed the rope harness and grunted with effort as he began to drag the furiously struggling shade into the shrine, the other Masks hurrying past him as the blems screeched in fury and one’s mouth opened – only for the gates to jerk closed past the shade’s foot, a dull thump hitting the metal form the other side.

Furious hammering against the door ensued, but the sound was muted and the metal did not even tremble.

The four Masks stood there in the dark for a heartbeat, alone with a terribly angry monster, until Ira lit a lantern and their faces were cast into light. They traded looks, a little at a loss, until the thief cleared his throat.

“I’m not giving back the hat,” Tristan firmly stated.

—

With two headless men pounding at the gate and a barely contained shade in there with them, none of them thought resuming the fight to be a sound notion.

After they dragged the shade in a corner away from them, the four spread out and saw to their own health. He’d not come with a physician’s kit, but he had cloth and sweat enough wiping himself clean of Silumko’s blood was easily done. He offered to check on the man’s leg, suspecting it sprained, but got only a frosty look.

“Fair,” Tristan admitted.

It was Cressida that put it forward they should formally make a truce until they left the shrine, which the continued pounding at the gate made a sound argument for. The motion passed unanimously and the tension thawed a bit, if only a bit. Silumko had been coming here for days and he had water stashed as well as six cheap wicker lanterns, both of which were shared.

Tristan had wondered what the inside of the shrine would look like – the proper rooms, not the glorified closet he’d made it into – and he was duly impressed once enough lamps were lit they were able to see around.

The heart of the room was a massive bronze altar sculpted like a procession of foxes chasing after falling stars, never quite sinking their fangs into them. Pale marble benches faced the center of the room, radiating out in circles, and the ceiling was covered with twisting rivers of bronze. There were two doors out, save for the front gates, in the corners of the room near the back.

Both were closed, and according to Silumko likely to remain so unless he was allowed to ‘proceed with the work’.

“This doesn’t look like Antediluvian work, aside from the choice of metal,” Cressida noted.

“It is not,” Ira replied. “The kings of ancient Sologuer built these shrines over the works of the Ancients. They believed themselves capable of drawing power from such places.”

“They mutilated the aether machinery is what they did,” Silumko grumbled. “There are channels all over these walls that got redirected, it’s no wonder this entire setup is good as scrapped.”

The man had been quiet and almost harried, but now that they’d been in here for fifteen minutes and no one bared a knife he was getting rather chattier.

“Redirected towards where?” Tristan asked.

“That gaudy altar,” the Malani said. “It is hollow. Meant for some sort of ritual, I think.”

The thief sighed.

“The shade goes inside, doesn’t it?”

He did not deny it.

“My theory,” Silumko said, “is that they used to put people in there, but anything with a connection to aether should do. I know how to work the controls, but the power always diffuses. I believe it needs to pass through the altar successfully for the doors to open, connecting both sides.”

“And a lemure would work?” Cressida asked.

“I expect it will blow up after a few seconds so the window will be short, but yes,” Silumko replied.

Ira looked fascinated.

“And if someone was put inside the altar instead?” she asked.

“No idea,” the Malani said. “I’m not a Savant. Aetheric mechanics are my area of expertise, not the fleshy bits.”

“Are you quite sure you’re a Mask?” Tristan teased. “You sound more the Tinker.”

And if a bit of teasing to him to keep talking, all the better.

“I was recruited because poisoned an entire branch of House Gumede with their own poison-testing artifact,” Silumko bluntly replied. “There’s a price on my head and the Krypteia both has a use for saboteurs and the ability to hide me.”

An awkward heartbeat passed.

“I did not truly expect you to answer that,” the Sacromontan admitted.

Silumko shrugged.

“It is not so well-kept a secret it cannot be found out,” he said, then cleared his throat. “Personal matters aside, we all have an interest in reaching the tower. Will you not let me open the way?”

There was some hesitation, but in truth all of them were curious and there was little else to do considering they were going to have to wait out the blems. Agreement was had and they went about the preparations together. The shade was beaten into compliance with the butt of muskets before Ira and Cressida tossed it into the altar, which would have felt in poor taste were the creature not a clawed monster wanting to eat them all.

Silumko, hobbling about, asked the two to close the altar above the shade and set about waking the aether machinery. Mostly that involved prying open hidden compartments under bronze wall decorations to fiddle with the devices inside, then kneeling at the low platform by the altar and pointing out a lever worked to look like simple gilding.

“Pull that on my word,” he instructed Tristan.

The thief nodded. Silumko picked up a silvery tool that looked like a dull hook at the end of a rod, then hobbled to the door to the left of the backwall. Frowning, he worked it into a small keyhole to the side and only then exhaled.

“Now,” Silumko said.

Tristan pulled the lever, which was surprisingly well-oiled even after all these years. After a heartbeat there was a click and the air thrummed. Light coursed along the ceiling like veins of bronze as the shade screamed inside the altar, but the thief barely paid it attention: his eyes were on Silumko. The Malani twisted his wrist delicately, then let out a noise of triumph as there resounded a quiet hiss and the stone door slid open. Ira, who had been told to stand ready with the largest stone they could find, put it in the way of the door in case it tried to close again when-

There was sound like wet splatter and the bronze lights winked out.

“Best take some lanterns in, it seems,” Cressida drily said.

To their common pleasure, the door did not try to close so there was no need to wriggle through and hope the stone did not shatter under unknown pressure. They moved into the back of the shrine gingerly, wary of traps, but that proved unnecessary: the last people to come here had been much more interested in trashing the place than trapping it. Lantern light lapped at the walls of the broad half-circle of a chamber, revealing scars and cracks while near everything else in the room was either rubble or scraps. There were twisted bits of bronze and a surprising amount of black marble, but the only thing in there still whole was a square steel contraption.

It was at the apex of the half-circle, about half the height of a man and just as broad, and small beads of light almost like droplets were travelling along its surface.

“Another machine?” Tristan asked.

“Not like any I know,” Silumko admitted.

“Here,” Ira called out.

Tristan had missed a detail, it seemed: to the contraption’s left there were words written in chalk on the wall. His stomach tightened the moment he realized that, like that taunting note he’d found in the other shrine, it was written in the four most common languages of Vesper. Cressida raised her lantern, leaning in, and read the words out loud as the thief worried the inside of his cheek.

“If the lights were lit, passage from eight to nine the following day. Through the red door.”

Tristan was no signifier, but this reeked of one thing in particular to him.

“That thing lets you into a layer,” he said.

It was the only thing that made sense. The tower only seemed partly present at the best of times, so unpleasant as the thought there was logic to a layer being path inside. Eight to nine, was it? The thief eyed the others, finding their faces blank. At least until one of them broke the silence.

“You can all consider me withdrawn from the race, then,” Silumko sighed.

Tristan blinked at him.

“Why?”

“I would like to live to thirty, Lord Ferrando,” the Malani said. “That tends to be less achievable when one blindly enters layers whose foundation were laid in the shadow of Scholomance.”

He shrugged.

“There are other classes, and still time enough to find them,” Silumko said. “Good luck to you all in this suicidally foolish endeavor. If you survive and ever want to trade information, I run with the Twenty-Ninth.”

Tristan eyed him cautiously, looking for the lie but finding nothing.

“Fair enough,” the thief acknowledged, and offered his hand. “It’s been an interesting acquaintance.”

“It has,” Silumko said, shaking it.

The Malani nodded to the other, who after some hesitation returned it.

“Now if you’ll excuse me,” Silumko said, “I am going to take a nap until the blems are gone and hope they did not savage my pack so much I am out of the truly odious mixture that will obscure the smell of my wounds.”

They all watched him limp away, slightly bemused. Ira was the one to break the silence.

“I, too, have decided to withdraw,” she tittered. “The dangers are too great.”

Tristan snorted.

“See you tomorrow, Ira,” he replied.

He followed after Silumko, stretching out his arms. Cressida simply flipped off the other Mask before heading back to the shrine room.

—

It took two hours for the blems to leave and they agreed to wait one more just to be sure.

Tristan cheated and had Fortuna step out to see if they were still around before volunteering to be the one to look out and see if there was still danger. His bravery was much praised, Ira even complimenting the honor of House Villazar. Ferranda was going to kill him, but it was simply too funny to stop now. Though the four of them had come with intentions to bludgeon one another, truce was extended to the way back to Scraptown and they banded together for safety on the path.

It was there they parted ways, and not on the terms he would have liked.

“We’ve opened the path to the tower,” Cressida bluntly told him. “Our alliance is finished.”

He narrowed his eyes at her.

“You think I’ll be easier to roll than Ira,” he said.

The Lusitanian shrugged, not denying it.

“You should have let me shoot her leg,” she said, and walked away.

“Cold,” Fortuna mused from his side. “You have to respect that.”

Did he? He would not cast blame for it, blame had no place in such things, bit neither would he admire it. Perhaps he should. It felt like his edge had dulled since he left Sacromonte, clutching at this and that like he was a man instead of a rat. He’d run all the way across Port Allazei to leave the cottage behind and now part of him felt like he should be running from this place as well. Only he was trapped on this fucking island, unable to leave and disappear into the crowd.

Infuriating.

He left Scraptown behind, first swinging by the cottage to notify the Thirteenth he still lived. Song had left out the latter, as if to chide him for not having bothered to write a second. He left the cottage after grabbing fresh food and blackpowder to head back dockside. There he stashed his affairs in the attic after looping around for half an hour to make sure Cressida wasn’t following him. She’d proved skilled enough at the art. Only perched up there did he let himself relax, napping for a few hours and having a meal.

Fortuna sat with him as he finished the last of the bread and chicken, eyeing an ant across the ground. No doubt if she had a physical form she would be tormenting the poor thing.

“It’s not looking good,” he admitted. “The hour’s known, so the others will head there as early as they can and wait.”

And he did not believe he could win in a fight against either woman. Ira looked the softer target of the two, but she had still been able to fend off a trained swordswoman with a knife long enough to pull out her own sword. Tristan doubted he would have been able to do the same.

“You could lay traps,” Fortuna suggested.

“We’re all going to get there as early as we can,” Tristan grunted. “I wouldn’t have time.”

If they’d checked the board, which they would have, they would know the lemures thinned on the ground around six in the morning. Six fifteen was probably the best time to get going, which was why Tristan had been using it.

“I also don’t have the materials for traps,” he admitted. “The few drugs in my physician’s kit wouldn’t do the trick.”

“Then bring thugs,” Fortuna drily said. “Ask the Thirteenth to come.”

“No point,” he said, shaking his head. “Tomorrow’s thirdday. You think Song will miss Teratology for this, give Professor Kang fuel for the fire? No, there no other options.”

The goddess turned a golden stare on him.

“There are quite literally two more people in your cabal,” Fortuna said.

His fingers clenched.

“No.”

“No,” she repeated, unimpressed.

“No,” he snarled. “Do you not get it, Fortuna? If I go to them, they own me. I admit I cannot cut it on my own, that I need them to stay here. Song thought she could push me, and she got away with it. If I come crawling back, she has me by the throat.”

“Maryam-”

“Is my friend,” he said. “Not my keeper, and I didn’t see her stepping in that night once the swinging started. Did you?”

Not even the Lady of Long Odds had quite enough wherewithal to suggest involving Angharad Tredegar in the affairs of Masks alone.

“Wen,” she finally said. “Is his office on Tolomontera not to aid you? He might have advice.”

Tristan hesitated.

“He already gave me the Chimerical, or good as,” he said. “Besides I don’t need advice, I need an angle.”

She looked like she wanted to argue, and did. He half-ignored her on his way out of the house, taking to the port. It was dangerous to wander around too much with a price still on his head so he kept to side streets, but the air helped him think and for all its foibles Port Allazei was still less dangerous than the Murk in many ways. Only neither the sea breeze nor the streets yielded answers.

“Wen,” Fortuna insisted, smelling an opening.

At this point it was no longer about helping him for her, it was about winning. In a twisted way, that had him considering taking the advice. Captain Wen did have a way of knowing things he-

“Huh,” Tristan muttered.

“You have come over to the wisdom of my words,” his goddess guessed. “As it should be.”

“Wen once told me,” the thief said, “that Alvareno’s Dosages is required reading for all Krypteia.”

“And?”

“I know who the poisoning teacher is,” Tristan said, “which means I know who will be selling poison cabinets.”

“You still need to lay those traps in advance,” Fortuna pointed out. “You tried the night before, it will only get you killed.”

Which was a problem, yes, but only if he let this turn into a footrace. It didn’t have to be.

“Crossing during the night will,” he agreed.

“You can’t be serious,” the goddess said. “You want to sleep out there?”

“They can’t beat me to it if I’m already there,” Tristan replied, and abruptly turned around.

He knew the way to the Chimerical from here, more or less. Time to see if Hage was willing to part with his stock.

—

Devils were a particular sort of evil. Tristan walked out with a worse box than the one he’d had on the Dominion, and with only two silvers left to his funds.

Half of what remained went to finding the Twenty-Ninth Brigade and arranging to rent a tool for a day.

—

The guards of Scraptown were beginning to know him by sight, a recognition that had him greasing palms with coppers to learn that neither Ira nor Cressida had returned to the tower.

Double the sum ensured they would keep quiet about his having passed through.

—

By the time Vanesa’s watch marked five in the morning, Tristan had not slept more than fifteen minutes in a row even thought Fortuna kept watch the whole night. Every sound, ever whisper of the wind had wrenched him awake. His hiding place, up on a length of piping both sides of which had fallen off and so stood as an raised isle of bronze, was not the kind most lemures could have reached.

But some could have, and that knowledge had been enough to have him sleeping in fear sweats.

Now, though, he had the last laugh. He lowered the rope and made his way back to the ground, finding the shrines were back even if much of the tower was still missing. The gates they had left open yesterday yawned open, beckoning him in, and he breathed in deeply.

Time to see if ruining his finances had been worth it.

—

Ira arrived at precisely seven, armed to the teeth: musket, pistols, sword and two knives. Not someone he remotely wanted to get into a scrap with.

Cautiously she approached the open gates of the shrine, only to stop cold. As well she should, since Tristan had earlier picked up Silumko’s caltrops and spread them in front of the door like a moat. The Someshwari peered into the shrine and found no one, but there were plenty hiding places in there. She had to know that it would be child’s play to hole up in there with a musket and shoot at whoever tried to clear the caltrops until the passage opened.

“There’s no need for this,” Ira called out. “There are still two places left, we can work together.”

If Cressida had not reached out to make a deal, Tristan would eat his own newly acquired hat.

Ira unbelted her sheathed sword and cautiously began pushing aside caltrops, constantly eyeing inside the shrine to look for a pointed muzzle. It was busy with the work that Cressida found her. The two women eyed each other warily, but relieved the Sacromontan from the obligation of eating his hat by sharing curt nods.

“We can clear them out properly, he’s not going to shoot,” Cressida said. “He doesn’t have it in him.”

There was a faint note of contempt to the words that had Tristan’s belly clenching.

“You first,” Ira drily replied.

After a minute of Cressida brushing aside caltrops, the Someshwari was convinced and joined in. By seven thirteen they’d cleared a path, which was quite unfair since it had taken him easily thrice that to place the caltrops. They entered with guns out, Ira calling out a warning they would shoot on sight, only for silence to answer them.

That was when the both of them to noticed the door, commanding their full attention.

Tristan put out the rope and slid down from the same perch where he’d spent the night, landing softly on the ground as he heard bits of conversation inside. He readied the rags and the matches. By now they would be close to the bronze door with the double pop seals he’d gone to steal in the other shrine up earlier and which was now wedged squarely across the only open door to the passage. Blocking it entirely, save for an open stripe above and below.

“-if he wedged it in, we can rip it out,” Cressida was saying.

“He’ll be waiting with a pistol on the other side,” Ira said. “I don’t know how he got here so early but-”

Tristan crept up to the gates, pressed against the wall after toeing aside the caltrops in the way. The two argued for a bit, until agreeing at least that they grid should be taken out. They paused after that, as if expecting him to reveal himself, but they were misunderstanding the nature of his plan here. The grid wasn’t meant to stop them at all.

“Fine, give me room and cover the angle,” Ira grunted. “I’ll change shape and rip it out.”

If something requiring strength had to be done quickly, Tristan had known from the start who would do it and how. He’d known he would be able to use it the moment he recalled Ira’s clothes sleeves bursting when she had turned into a large man.

Because it meant that when she ripped out the wedged door, she would not be wearing gloves.

The sound of metal being scraped sounded, then a surprised sound.

“It’s wet,” Ira said. “Why would there still be-”

“Shit, wipe your hands,” Cressida said, sounding like she was backing a way. “That’s not water.”

No, water wasn’t anywhere that expensive. That was a full silver’s worth of Spinster’s Milk, the version of the venom treated so it could serve as a coating without drying. Tristan checked his watch. Seven fifteen. Assuming both palms had made contact, she should be down in a matter of minutes.

“He’ll have an antidote,” Ira breathed out. “He must. Villazar, you fuck, you-”

Ah, and the sound of the pair rushing into the back room. That was the signal. Tristan reached into hiso pocket for the matches, scratching them and lighting the three packs of rags he’d prepared before pulling up a cloth over his face. He stepped into the shrine, throwing two in the main shrine room and one close to the back door.

Smoke immediately began to waft up, thick and odorous.

“Did you hear that?” Cressida asked.

Hurry now. Left of the gates, the stonework that looked like a square with a bronze triangle inside. Tristan pulled out the silver aether tool he’d rented from Silumko, a X at the end of a rod that he pressed once against the surface of the square then pivoted twice to the side.

“Villawar,” Ira snarled, already slurring. “What is shis?”

He turned and found her pointing a pistol at him. Tristan raised his hands, stepped back towards the door. Cressida took one glance at the lit rags, the fumes, and covered her mouth with her sleeve and stepped back. The movement distracted Ira, and in that heartbeat Tristan ran for the gates.

He pulled at the luck even before the shot sounded, feeling the ticking rise sharply – and releasing it in the same breath as he threw himself forward.

The shot streaked just above his head, somehow missing flesh but tearing a stripe through the top of his new hat and of his hair. The heat burned, but he got recompense in the way the two inside shouted in anger as the gates to the shrine closed behind him. The thief got up, passing a hand through his slightly shorn hair and wincing. Twice over when he looked down, as there was a caltrop spiked into the coat that’d come a hair’s breadth away from drawing blood.

“What is in those things anyway?” Fortuna asked, leaning against the door. “I saw you gather up that ichor from the burst lemure, but I did not recognize that vial from the cabinet.”

“Sweetsleep,” he said, taking out his watch. “The full stock.”

Seven seventeen.

“You dosed them with poppy?” Fortuna laughed.

“The derivative that puts people to sleep, yes,” he replied. “Thickened with the blood it should make enough smoke to fill both rooms and some.”

The real issue was going to be not killing them by robbing them of air entirely. Ten minutes was the most he was willing to risk, so at seven twenty-seven he went to pop open the gates the way Silumko had told him to. For a price. Smoke came pouring out and Tristan waited with his blackjack in hand. No movement inside. He put out the rag fires then found Ira by the door in the back, making sure she was still breathing before risking a look inside the back room.

There lay Lady Cressida Barboza, that hat with the golden rope over her face, seemingly sleeping like a baby. He nudged the hat off her face, blackjack at the ready, but she did not react. He divested her of her weapons, then went back to the other room and did the same with the Someshwari. All the weapons he dumped outside, before forcing open the shrine and putting them both inside it. Facing each other like they were sitting in a bathtub.

That ought to make for an interesting wakeup, he figured. His gaze lingered on the girl he’d worked with, if only for a day.

“It’s harder, not to use the tile,” Tristan quietly said. “But if all I wanted to learn was easy, why come to Scholomance?”

He waited alone in the backroom for twenty-nine minutes, until the beads of light on the steel frame formed into a curtain. He went through the passage alone.

–

Tristan crawled through the curtain of light and emerged into Hell.

He was on the streets of Tolomontera, but he could hardly tell: it was as if the entire world were aflame, curtains of smoke obscuring even the Grand Orrery’s lights as the dull roar of fire swept through the city. The world ending did not seem to hinder the battle taking place from rolling on, unsurprisingly, as men in coats of mail wielding spears fought against armed riders with face-covering helms and – shit, were those devils?

Best find that red door fast. 

The north side of the street was a burning ruin, the part leading where he thought might be the port was being enthusiastically occupied by a devil and its significantly less enthusiastic victims while the other side was – huh, that had to be the largest brother Tristan had ever seen. And it still had lights on? While the gray-eyed man was no great fancier of sex, admittedly – if he wanted strangers to press against him uncomfortably, he’d elbow his way into the crowd at charity bread distribution – but he figured not even the most ardent partisans of the hobby would not indulge while the city was being sacked around them. Shots sounded in the distance, startling him, and the thief headed up the street towards the brothel.

It was a three-story edifice with two side wings and sundry balconies, occupying moist of a city block, and glass windows had been barred with furniture. The front door, painted green, had knockers shaped like… well, something Tristan struggled with believing anyone would enjoy getting knocked.

“Halt,” someone shouted, and the thief looked up.

A bulky musket was being pointed at him from a balcony above, a middle-aged woman with a heavily powdered face glaring. No, not a musket. What must have come before them: barely more than a tube of metal on a length of wood, a small rope with a knot tied under where the trigger would be. It was heavy enough she had to prop it up against the balcony railing to keep it pointed.

“No closer,” she called out in accented Antigua. “Go back, we are closed.”

Tristan raised his hands.

“I am looking for a red door,” he called out.

“Did you not hear me, boy?” the woman bit out. “We are closed.”

He frowned.

“The brothel’s called the Red Door?” he asked.

“Last warning,” she said. “Leave.”

Good as confirmation. He’d thought that note out in the shrine was too straightforward. He’d just best there was a painted red door somewhere around here that led to a pit full of scorpions or something of the sort. Now he just needed her to move first.

“Your door’s painted green,” Tristan complained. “It is a very misleading-”

He saw it in the way her body tensed a second before she pulled at the rope. That gun was bulky, almost more like small handheld cannon than true firearms, and the powdered woman was not large: she prepared for the kickback before pulling the rope.

Good.

He broke into a run, straight for the door as two heartbeats passed and she tried to follow his movement with the gun – but it was heavy and he was quick. Even as the woman shouted above, he reached the doors and wrenched them open. To his dim surprised the actually opened, revealing on the other side two large men pointing crossbows at him while a crew stacked furniture across a gaudily decorated entrance hall.

Through the red door, the note had said. That teacher was a bloody sadist.

“Fuck,” Tristan said, and threw himself through the threshold as the bolts went flying.

He flopped belly down on the floor, the breath smacked out of him as a steel tip sliced off a lock of his hair, and as he gasped he-

Looked down not at overly colored tiles but dull grey stone.

“When prostrating your belly should not touch the ground, only your knees and forehead.”

Panting, sweat running down his back, the thief allowed himself a moment to close his eyes and rest his face against the cool stone. Only after a solid ten seconds did he push himself up with a groan, getting onto his knees and matching the gaze of middle-aged Malani woman with round cheeks and bright eyes. She was beaming at him.

“This is inside the tower?” he asked.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she said. “Who are you?”

He frowned. Could she not even give him a straight answer now that he had made it here? He pushed himself up, taking in the room – barely more than a closet, with a small desk and candle where this Malani had been reading a book while sitting on a rickety chair. There was a door by her, wooden and closed.

“Tristan Abrascal,” he said. “Are you a Mask teacher?”

If Hage had spoken truly, they were bound to answer that question properly.

“I am your mother,” the Malani informed him. “You have not been eating your vegetables.”

His lips thinned. What was this – the woman shivered, and that was when he noticed it. She didn’t shiver like a person, not properly. It came from under the skin, like she was just wearing it.

“You’re a devil,” he blurted. “Again?”

How many devil teachers did the Krypteia have? The thing wearing a Malani suit grinned, but before she could answer the door was wrenched open. An angry ten-year-old Malani girl glared at them both, decked in too-large black robes and wearing pretty red ribbons in her braids.

“Cozen, if you ever put the key on a high shelf again I will feed you to crabs,” the child snarled. “And you, stop giving her what she wants. A cryptic should know better.”

Tristan cleared his throat awkwardly.

“Pardon?”

“She feeds on casual dislike, you idiot,” the girl said. “That shot you just gave her will have her insufferable for the entire afternoon.”

“So offhandedly contemptuous,” Cozen dreamily sighed. “It tastes like pepper.”

Tristan cleared his throat again, increasingly bewildered.

“I am-”

“Nerei’s latest, yes, we’re all gossiping about it,” the girl said. “I am Professor Sizakele, teacher for Aetheric Warfare. Also known as ‘Deicide’.”

“I would like to attend your class,” Tristan tried.

“You can,” Professor Sizakele began, then shuddered.

Under the Sacromontan’s horrified stare she began trembling and shaking, falling to the ground. He glanced at the devil, Cozen, but she seemed unmoved. Mere seconds later the fit ceased, and Tristan was no longer looking at a young girl but a woman in her twenties. Those robes were no longer loose.

“Ugh,” Professor Sizakele said. “As I was saying, you can begin attending on firstday afternoons from one to six. Cozen will give you a keystone and show you the shortcut.”

Tristan cleared his throat a third time.

“Not to be impolite,” he said, “but if I may ask…”

“Some gods are sore losers,” Professor Sizakele replied. “I age a decade every hour, which means I die thrice a day. It leaves me requiring some help, for which I was cursed with Cozen’s assistance.”

The devil happily waved.

“This is a contract price?” he asked.

“No. I beat a Someshwari god of death at riddles but the bastard tried to stiff me on the immortality,” the professor idly replied. “Turns out the words for ‘undying’ and ‘continuing’ are the same in Ghantalasa, which he thought was very funny.”

She smiled.

“Note the past tense,” Professor Sizakele said, adjusting her robes around her newly grown frame. “That’s enough chatter, however. I have another student coming and I’ll not brook doubling up so you have to go. Cozen will see you out.”

He was left standing there, feeling a bit like it was the aftermath of a storm, until the devil made eye contact with him and slowly tore a page off her book.

“That’s not going to work,” he warned her.

“I just like breaking things,” she smiled.

It worked, damnit.

—

Getting Cozen to do what she was supposed to was much like pulling teeth, but eventually Tristan was given a ‘keystone’ – a small latch key quite literally made of stone – and ushered through a tower room so quickly he barely glimpsed the inside before being guided through a door that would serve as a gate back into the layer the devil referred to as ‘the Landing’.

On the other side was not a room but a pit, which Cozen pushed him into.

He landed back into Port Allazei as it was being sacked, so that part was true, and on the outskirts of the fighting besides. Frowning as he followed the devil’s directions to the way out of the layer, Tristan kept an eye out for movement. The fire had yet to spread this far out so he navigated mostly by Orrery lights as he turned where told to turn and came in sight of the stone bridge that was his way out.

Only there was someone standing on it.

The thief stilled. Cozen had been painfully clear that the path was supposed to be deserted that early into the layer’s span. This must be a visitor, then. The student that had beat all of them to the tower? He would admit to some curiosity about that identity, enough to risk his own face being seen. Carefully, he approached the silhouette. A woman, he saw from behind. Dark hair, about his height. She was looking out into the distance, almost pensive.

Once at the foot of the bridge there was no more cover to hide behind – and staringly another Mask might be dangerous – so he coughed to announce himself.

“Good morning,” Tristan called out. “I did not expect to-”

Then she turned and the thief froze.

“Maryam?”

# Chapter 28

The nerve, really. Like putting on his face would be all it took to trick her.

“You are the most inventive so far, I’ll grant,” Maryam coldly said, “but it is still a miss.”

The signifier’s fingers cut across the air, Gloam dragging behind as the primordial dark leaped eagerly to her command. Or so it felt like. Objectively she knew she was likely barely middle tier when it came to control at the moment, but the sheer difference it made was…

“That does not look pleasant,” the mara wearing Tristan’s face said. “Please don’t do whatever this is?”

He backed away with his hands raised instead of outright fleeing, the way most mara would when threatened with something that could hurt them. They were scavengers, not hunters. Maryam frowned, keeping a tight grip on the roiling Gloam as she refrained from tracing the Sign’s last stroke. Mara could talk, they were intelligent, but this was unusual behavior for one.

“Leave,” she said.

Tristan pinched the bridge of his nose.

“I would,” he said, “but you are standing on top of the gate I would use. Are you really Maryam? You should be in class right now.”

“That’s rich, coming from you,” she replied, then cursed herself.

You should not talk to mara, it only gave them more to work with.

“Class has been over for at least an hour,” she challenged.

“Did Kang kick you out early?” the mara frowned. “It shouldn’t be past nine in the morning.”

If this was a trick, Maryam thought, it was a good trick. The Gloam was bucking wilder and wilder, so she let it disperse with a snap of the wrist. As long as he came no closer she would still have time to trace.

“What was the name of the mayor of Cantica?” she asked.

Maybe-Tristan cocked an eyebrow at her.

“First, put it down that we will be having a conversation about why that question would mark me as not an impostor instead of the hundred others I can think of,” he said.

This was, Maryam conceded amusedly, most probably Tristan.

“Second, his name was Crespin,” the gray-eyed man replied. “I might have forgiven him the man-eating tendencies, if he’d kept them turned on Tupoc.”

“I sometimes daydream about him having been eaten on the island,” Maryam admitted.

“Don’t we all?” Tristan replied, then his eyes narrowed. “Now, what’s this about classes being over?”

“It should be past noon,” Maryam told him. “I returned to the chapterhouse after Teratology ended.”

Leaving Song behind, but it was only a walk back to the front gates. There were only so many tricks Scholomance could attempt while on the spiked paths and the Tianxi was not the kind of fool to fall for them. Tristan’s jaw clenched.

“That should not be possible,” he said. “It was eight when I first entered this layer and I only left it for moments before returning. Is there such a thing as…”

He gestured vaguely, conveying a sense of general magical tomfoolery.

“Time travels one direction only,” Maryam firmly said.

The most Gloam could do was remove you from that journey for a while before spitting you out. If it ever spat you out.

“How did you get in here, anyway?”

Maryam refused to believe he was so profoundly unlucky as to trip into a layer twice in two weeks.

“I crawled through a hole,” Tristan noted. “Then I was pushed into a pit.”

Mask classes sounded like any other cabal’s punishment. One detail caught her interest, however.

“Those passages,” she said. “Were there Glare lights in them?”

“The first, yes,” he frowned. “More or less. The second was a dark pit whose bottom ended up being one of the streets near here.”

He was not slow to catch on.

“You think the dark was Gloam?” he asked.

“Almost certainly,” Maryam said. “Layer entrances do not grow on trees and most of them have Gloam near them. The pit must have eaten a few hours off you before letting you fall into here.”

The thief grimaced.

“Ah, a fresh addition to the list of why I will never have a sound night’s sleep ever again,” Tristan said. “It’d been a day, I suppose I was overdue.”

She would have passed that as humor if not for the exhausted undertone.

“Ancestors, what have you been up to?” she asked. “First you disappear for days, then-”

“Covenant business,” he replied.

“That’s not an answer,” Maryam said.

“It’s the one on offer,” he said. “What are you doing in here, anyway? I thought layers were particularly dangerous for signifiers.”

“I’m fine,” she sniffed. “Unlike you, I’m tethered to the material by a Navigator keeping watch over me. She would pull me back if I were in danger.”

Unless it was danger unlikely to kill her and likely to yield interesting results. There was a reason Maryam had said that Captain Yue was ‘watching over’ her and not ‘protecting’.

“That’s not an answer,” he smugly echoed, like a jackass.

It could not be a mara, they simply would not be able to manage such quantities of smug.

“It’s the one on offer,” she replied in her smarmiest voice, pulling a face.

“Fair,” Tristan conceded, lips twitching. “I expect this is not the place to have that conversation, anyway.”

“It isn’t,” Maryam said, casting a wary gaze around. “Will you be at the cottage tonight?”

He hesitated.

“Will you?”

After this, she was inclined to cut her day early. Captain Yue should keep the grumbling to a minimum, given the hours Maryam had already volunteered this week and the glad news she would be bringing back from this jaunt. She had not run the whole spectrum of tests yet, but the first results had been more than promising.

She had cautiously high hopes for the rest.

“Yes,” she decided. “And I’ll be expecting you for supper.”

“I suppose I’ve nothing better to do,” he conceded.

They stood there for a moment, looking at each other awkwardly, until Maryam remembered and cleared her throat.

“Right, the bridge is your way out,” she said.

Which was the reason she had manifested here in the first place. Captain Yue was alarmingly powerful, but breaching anything but the shallowest part of a layer through brute strength was still beyond the older signifier. This was almost certainly the real Tristan, but Maryam took no risks: she backed away and kept her hand at the ready. He seemed, if anything, to approve of her wariness.

“Right,” Tristan said, stepping onto the bridge. “I suppose I should look for-”

Between two footsteps she blinked and just like that he was gone, vanished into nothing.

“I am going to make fun of you for that,” Maryam announced.

There should still be a few minutes until the layer’s coherence pressure grew strong enough to try and push her out, forcing Yue to shift her location again, so she should get to reason she was out here in the first place. Breathing in, Maryam straightened her back and raised her hand.

The Sphere first.

Her nav a brush, she painted the Gloam into the shape she’d been taught. Gods, the difference it made. Like using an actual paintbrush, even if her fingers were numb, instead of trying to… splash paint at the wall in the right shape. The sphere of pure Gloam formed with a dull pop, which Captain Totec had once described as the consequence of it coming together quickly enough to be hermetic, and Maryam just knew that her creation would be able to bear a man’s weight without wobbling.

It still fought her to collapse, as Gloam always did, but that could be wrestled back into line by tightening the grip of her will. An Ancipital Sign traced just like that, solid and smooth and without a full minute of preparation first. She couldn’t quite believe it. Ancipitals were supposed to be the easiest Signs, simple manipulation of raw Gloam on a small scale, yet Maryam had always found them an uphill struggle.

Excitement rising, she dismissed the sphere and set down a small metal cube on the floor of the bridge. Two downwards stroke and a slash, anchoring at the cube and tethering: the Pinching Ward.

It was delicate work, bordering on conceptual, so like most Acumenal Signs it did not require a heavy hand. The difference, this time, came in depth. Maryam nudged the cube with her foot, breaching the condition of ‘movement’, and immediately felt like the inside of her arm was being harshly pinched. It was a false pain but it felt real, and not a mere twinge of discomfort either.

 If her Ward had been that strong, in Cantica, she would not have slept through Tredegar being attacked.

Maryam picked up the cube, stashing it away with trembling fingers. Yue had given her an order to follow, she should now be attempting the basic Didactic Sign known as the Heat Thief, but Maryam had to know. The Izvorica had never once, in all her time as a practitioner, been able to use a Thalassic Sign. Large-scale manipulation of raw Gloam, the branch of the arts that had made the Navigators the power that they were.

She breathed out, calmed herself, and raised her hand toward the wan sky of ancient Tolomontera. She raked her fingers like claws, ripping into the nothing, and felt her hand plunge into the Gloam. Gods, she’d never even made it this far before, she could – focus. Carefully and slowly, she dragged her clawing fingers down before her in a smooth, rounded zigzag. Thick trails of Gloam were left behind, like smudges of oil, and Maryam’s heart leaped in her throat.

She pulled out her hand and released the Gloam, a shit-eating grin on her face.

“Wind Carding,” Maryam exhaled. “Ancestors. Wind Carding.”

A child’s achievement, the Thalassic Sign that built into all the Wind sequences, but never before had she been able to use it. She’d always stumbled at seizing the Gloam currents, finding them hard as stone and sensing nothing like the fibers her instructors were telling her to pull and lay out into another shape. If she could Card then she might eventually be able to create her own winds of Gloam, to quell storms and hide the drag of ships from the leviathans of the deeps.

She could be a real Navigator, not a glorified hedge-witch that could properly use neither her mother’s arts nor her teacher’s. It took a while for the sheer glee to die down, until she could stop smiling long enough to focus. Yet she must, she still had a list to go through.

“Didactic,” she reminded herself.

And then an Autarchic, so Captain Yue could establish if baseline capacity regarding those changed when she was inside the layer. Only the moment she raised her hand, the world blurred.

Maryam hastily drew back her nav into herself, keeping a tight rein on self-perception as the layer tried to ‘heal’ the wound that Yue had made to get her inside. The Tianxi captain would not be able to withstand that strength head on, so instead would slash a fresh wound through the make of the layer and slide Maryam down it.

It felt a little like falling and a lot like being thrown.

When the world grew solid again, Maryam was standing on a rooftop. Looking around, she found herself near what must be the edge of Port Allazei – not far before her stood walls, and far behind her she could see smoke and fires where the army attacking the city fought for the docks. Movement caught her attention and with some dread she realized she was not alone.

Maryam was not far from city gates, which strangely enough were open. She shuffled to the edge of the rooftop for a better line of sight and froze. No, not open: ripped off their hinges.

A pack of devils – half wearing human shells, the others bare long-legged horrors – stood in torchlight, two of them bringing forward a large machine on a painted wooden litter. It was set down gently, facing the smashed gates, and after some chatter two shell-wearing devils approached it. Maryam stared at it all in the torchlight, spellbound.

The device looked like a printing press, though overlarge and made entirely of gray iron. The devils treated it with reverence, and the two who manned it only did so with great care. The corkscrew turned as the devils pushed the handles and the block fell, slamming into the press bed like a lightning strike. Forgelight burned bright at the edges, as if the insides were filled with molten iron, but this was no metalwork.

Maryam could hear the aether screaming, a chunk ripped out from the Empty Sea and compressed into a shape by the implacable tyranny of the machine.

And when the devils turned the handles the other way, untwisting the corkscrew and releasing the block, there was something where there had once been nothing. A many-limbed creature, its carapace almost shining as its mandibles twitched and came to… life, or close enough. A devil. They had made a devil, cast it from nothing by wounding the aether. Gods, was that how their entire kind came to be?

The creature twitched up, jerkily, and the other devils hooted in joy.

Maryam felt a shiver of dread run up her spine and did not think twice: she pulled at the tether, signaling Captain Yue to pull her out before she could see the rest of this nightmare.

—

She woke up strapped on the table, her body aching all over.

Captain Yue was still seated in her armchair, a small leather-bound journal in hand as she scribbled notes. The Tianxi bit at her lip as she leaned forward, the movement drawing her braid forward and revealing some of the burns around her ears before she let out a noise of satisfaction and drew back. Maryam focused on breathing, her heart still beating wildly.

“I could have kept you in there longer,” Yue said. “What happened?”

“I shifted to a dangerous place,” Maryam forced out. “I saw…”

She swallowed, feeling nauseous.

“Devils. One being made.”

The older woman looked, horribly enough, envious. Yue busied herself undoing the straps as she talked.

“Lucky!” the Tianxi said. “There’s hardly anyone alive who has seen an Infernal Forge in action, you know. The Watch destroyed most, the ones left are either sealed in Pandemonium or buried in the deep vaults under the Rookery.”

Maryam licked her lips, gingerly rubbing her wrist where the leather straps had left a red pressure mark.

“It’s really how they are…”

“Made?” Captain Yue finished. “Yes. Devils are not a natural race. The first were made by the Antediluvians, though I doubt any of that era are left. The oldest you’re likely to see out there were cast back during the Old Night.”

“What are they?” Maryam asked. “I thought they were aether intellects, maybe failed gods.”

“Arguably, they are the very opposite of gods,” Yue said. “A god is an aether intellect that seeks to manifest a physical body by feeding on tainted aether. Meanwhile, well – did you see the new devil long?”

“No,” she admitted. “I pulled at the tether soon after it was made.”

“Fresh castings are all but mindless, barely cleverer than dogs,” the Navigator said. “They gain mindfulness by feeding on tainted aether, and through that process eventually form, well – a makeshift soul, you could say, though not one like ours.”

“Annealing,” Maryam said. “That’s what annealing is, how they become immortal.”

Meaning that older devils feeding on something like slaughter were quite literally forging a soul out of the concept. She was most glad Pandemonium remained sealed by the Watch.

“A devil that annealed will continue to exist in the aether even when its physical body is destroyed,” Captain Yue confirmed. “It can be cast anew out of any Infernal Forge as soon as it has finished ‘swimming’ the aether towards it.”

She paused.

“It’s one of the reasons the Iscariot Accords ban signatories having any, not that it stops them trying,” the Tianxi said. “When we kill Hell’s nobility, the only place we want them coming back is behind the walls of Pandemonium where they’re more trouble to each other than us.”

Maryam made a noise of disgust.

“Why would anyone want to make devils?” she said.

“You’d be surprised. It was a favorite tactic of the Izcalli during the Succession Wars to cast a dozen devils inside enemy cities to soften them up before an assault,” Yue casually said. “They were hardly the only ones to use such means, though certainly the most infamous.”

Casually, as if she were not speaking sheer horror. Even freshly cast, devils would shrug off most blades and have the strength of several men while moving with the deftness of a cat. To let even a handful loose inside a city would mean… Gods. A hot knife through butter.

“But enough of that,” the older Navigator said. “You had long enough in there to try everything, I’d say. How were the results?”

“You were right,” Maryam admitted. “My control issues are all but gone when I am inside the layer.”

Captain Yue smiled triumphantly, reaching for her little book. The other woman’s latest theory had been thus: if Maryam could signify properly when inside a layer, then the source of her problems was not internal. After all you could only bring your own soul into a layer, nothing else.

“Which means the source of the disconnect is not within you,” she said. “We are dealing either with some sort of aetheric parasite or a fascinatingly esoteric turn of conceptual symmetry.”

The latter was what aetheric machines ran on, and the Izvorica could not ever remember a single instance where the concept being brought up in conjunction with a living being had been a good thing.

“I can hold our brigade plaque without burning,” Maryam pointed out. “I can’t be possessed.”

“The Judas test isn’t perfect,” Yue dismissively replied. “But I don’t mean that sort of parasite, anyhow. More likely some sort of entity glommed onto your presence in the aether and feeds exclusively off your emanations, which would make it much harder for you to control your logos and thus signify.”

That was… worrying credible, Maryam admitted to herself.

“The creature wearing my face,” she said. “That’s what you think it is.”

“Exclusive feeding would explain why it took your shape,” Yue pointed out. “It would suck at the marrow of strong emotions you emanate in the aether, deriving from them similar wants and desires to you but… jagged. Without context.”

Meaning dangerous, but that was not what the Izvorica honed in on as she sat up on the table.

“Strong emotions,” Maryam repeated. “Like fear.”

Yue grinned, having laid out that breadcrumb on purpose.

“Yes. If I am right, Scholomance spat you out because it incited fear in you but kept finding the plate empty when trying to feed,” the Tianxi said, sounding amused. “Some lesser entity kept slurping up your fear before it reached the school’s metaphorical mouth, which must have been quite galling.”

“You’ll excuse me if I do not find that as hilarious as you,” Maryam said through gritted teeth.

“Probably for the best,” Yue mused. “It might feed on that too.”

Her jaw clenched until her teeth ached.

“How do I get rid of it?” she asked. “It’s the key to fixing all my problems.”

“That is difficult to say,” Captain Yue replied. “With a few guildsmen helping weave the net I might be able to trap and kill it, but there is no telling what consequences that would have for you. It would be prudent to find out exactly what manner of entity it is first, as well as the nature of its ties to you.”

She could already tell where this was going.

“You have tests,” Maryam said.

“Oh yes,” Yue grinned. “And most of them have even been done on humans before!”

She had to be doing that on purpose, the Izvorica thought. No one could be so genuinely terrible at offering reassurance.

“Not today,” she said, rolling her shoulder. “I have some brigade business to attend to.”

“It’s still early,” the Tianxi said. “And some of them can be run rather quickly, if you’re willing to forego painkillers to-”

“Urgent business,” Maryam hastily said.

The other Navigator studied her a moment.

“Did you encounter someone in the layer?” she asked. “I only received word minutes before you returned.”

Maryam frowned. Yue could not be referring to Tristan, then.

“I’ve no idea what you mean,” she said.

“Oh?” Captain Yue said. “That’s even more interesting.”

When in that kind of a mood, getting anything out of the other woman was like pulling teeth. Best not to even try.

“I’ll be taking my leave,” Maryam said. “There is no need for an escort at this hour.”

“Heading back to your hideout?” Yue said. “I’d recommend swinging by the hospital first.”

Maryam’s brow rose and she looked herself up and down. She saw no wound and felt only somewhat tired. She had not stayed in the Landing for long.

“Why?”

“I’ve received word your captain is there,” the Tianxi said. “I expect she will be remaining there, too, until a decision has been made over the four murders she’s accused of committing.”

The what now?—

The hospital looked like an Orthodoxy temple, only stretched out: it was one large, squat tower and a rectangular hall with a few anterooms sprouting on either side.

The Orthodoxy wasn’t really a proper faith, the way Maryam saw it, even if most mornaric believed otherwise. They worshipped many gods and dedicated temples to them, just like back home, but most Orthodoxy temples were… renthouses for the divine. A great hall with niches for a hundred small gods, with a larger shrine in the back not for any patron god but for the Circle Perpetual.

Orthodoxy priests could dedicate themselves to any god, but many instead pledged themselves to the Circle itself. They talked of themselves as intercessors with the divine, giving alms and guidance to the living so they might better live until the next spin of the wheel. It was creepy, she’d always thought, as if the priests back home had sworn themselves to the Nav instead of the gods governing it.

And since the Circle couldn’t talk back when prayed to, talking was done in its name. Tianxia and Imperial Someshwar had been fighting for centuries over which priesthood had been ordained to oversee the wheel of souls and which was vile, heretical usurpers abusing a sacred office for political gain.

Maryam had been amused to learn that the Tianxi claim to be the new heart of the Orthodoxy – the old one now being a hollow nightmare down in Old Liergan – was actually inherited from the Kingdom of Cathay, which was very philosophically awkward for the modern Republics to explain. No that the Someshwar’s rival claim, which was based on their being the Third Empire, held up all that much better under scrutiny. The distinct lack of the Imperial Someshwar ruling the world was something of a hindrance to the argument.

Still, while the hospital somewhat had the look of an Orthodoxy temple there were differences.

For one there were blackcloak guards at every entrance, alert and armed to the teeth, and even a few atop the flat roof topping the main hall. The other difference was subtler, at least for someone who did not have a signifier’s senses. Maryam did not even have to send out her nav to be able to taste the power wafting around here: these were hallowed grounds, dedicated to the god dwelling within. Already uncomfortable with the weight in the air, she put a spring to her step until the guards hailed her.

“Plaque,” an Izcalli sergeant demanded.

She presented it and was frowned at. Considering how much that gaze lingered on her face, even hooded as it was, she knew why. After a moment it was returned.

“I am looking for Captain Song Ren of the Thirteenth Brigade,” Maryam said.

“Ask the gray robes,” the watchman shrugged. “We don’t keep track of patients.”

They parted for her to pass through the open gates, ushering her into the great hall.

It was, she would admit, quite impressive. There must have been at least a hundred beds in here, put up against the walls at regular intervals so a corridor of room for gray-robed healers to move through was maintained. Lamps burned pale and bright, almost harsh to the eye, while the walls and floor had been covered with impeccably clean white lime. There were stairs leading to a second level, but her eyes were drawn to the silver door leading to the squat tower at the end of the hall.

Lady Knit’s shrine, no doubt. The scent permeating the aether here came from there, carried by the lazy currents of the Sea of Shapes.

One of the gray robes, a smiling dark-skinned man in his early thirties, waited patiently behind a tall writing desk for her to cease staring. Maryam cleared her throat with mild embarrassment.

“Oh, there’s no need for that,” he said. “It is quite the sight, isn’t it? The limework was done just weeks before students began to arrive.”

“It is larger than I anticipated,” she acknowledged.

And mostly empty. Save for the gray-robed attendants, there were barely a handful of people filling beds.

“It used to be a temple, but it was turned into a plague house after the Watch took the island so it was the natural choice for a healing ward when Scholomance opened again,” the friendly man said.

A pause.

“You seem in fine health, so how might I assist you?”

“I am looking for Captain Song Ren,” Maryam said.

“Ah,” he said. “Halfway down the hall, to the left. She is in one of the annexes and her door should be easy to recognize: it is the only one with guards. Are you from the Thirteenth Brigade as well?”

Maryam’s brow rose and she nodded. She offered up her plaque as proof, though the man barely glanced at it before leaning in and pitching his voice lower.

“She is under house arrest until the matter that saw her wounded is resolved,” he said. “Garrison officers have already been in twice and now your brigade’s patron is with her.”

“Are her wounds bad?” Maryam asked.

“I cannot share details even with a member of her brigade,” the man said, “but she is not currently in danger of dying.”

Maryam thanked him, receiving another smile, and hurried down the central lane. As the gray robe had said, it was hard to miss the door: two watchmen stood by it, though they looked bored and half asleep. A far cry from those outside. She was allowed in after showing her plaque a third time and being asked her name, one of them rousing himself to mark it down.

The ‘annex’ was a spacious room, sparsely furnished but with a large and clean bed on which Song was resting in a nest of pillows while Captain Wen Duan sat on one of the chairs to her right. Both turned when she entered, the guards closing the door behind her, and Maryam froze at the sight of Song. Bruised cheeks, a bandage around her throat and more around her right hand. That same arm was in a sling and she looked like she had bandages under the loose white shirt they’d made her wear.

Song Ren looked like she had been savagely beaten.

“Gods,” Maryam choked out. “They-”

“It looks worse than it is,” Song interrupted, sounding almost ashamed. “The arm is not broken and the fingers are only sprained. The rest is bruises.”

“And a concussion,” Wen harshly said. “Which is lucky. If the angle had been just a little different they could have dented your skull.”

She’d not noticed at first glance, only paying the man so much attention, but now Maryam could see it. It was in the way his eyes were tight under the golden spectacles, the cast of his jaw. Even the almost jerky way he moved.

Wen Duan was furious.

“What happened?” she asked.

“Sit,” Song tiredly said. “I’ll tell you everything.”

It was a sordid tale. Maryam had assumed that Professor Kang was holding Song back to berate her and felt guilty at leaving her companion behind, but the man’s dismissal had been too plain to argue with. Now that she knew it had been to enable an ambush, that the bastard had schemed with Jigong students to murder someone in his charge, that decision stuck in her throat like a chicken bone. She should have fought harder to stay, done something.

Song laid out in a distant, clinical tone how she killed one of her ambushers and wounded another before being overwhelmed. How they beat her down and moved her to another room so they could take their time torturing her before the execution without anyone stumbling onto them. How she was then saved at the last moment by Scholomance’s intervention.

“It must have been some sort of spirit,” Song said. “It made them turn on each other, so I was able to finish off the last. I found their roseless compass and made my way out until I stumbled across guards near the front gates.”

Wen’s face might as well have been made of stone.

“She is under house arrest, but I will have that lifted by the end of the day,” he said. “Not that she’ll be going anywhere in her state.”

He cocked an eyebrow at the bruised girl.

“If you’re willing to submit to truth-telling-”

“I will answer questions presented to me in advance that I agreed to, nothing more or less,” Song said.

“That’ll irritate some, but it’s your right as an enlisted officer,” Wen said, sounding almost approving. “This was a clear case of your defending yourself, so I would not expect punishment.”

He hesitated.

“But,” Wen said, and it was a world in a word.

“It’s already spread by now, hasn’t it?” Song quietly asked.

Maryam grimaced.

“Captain Yue knew,” she said. “She’s the one who suggested I come here.”

“The officers that got you out of Scholomance talked,” Wen admitted. “It will be all over the island by the end of the day.”

“My reputation is sunk,” Song softly said.

“You fought against four ambushers and won,” Maryam fiercely said. “Anyone who matters will care for that above the rest.”

The Izvorica’s fingers clenched and she turned a hard look on their patron.

“What about Kang?”

Wen’s jaw clenched.

“We are thin on proof,” the large Tianxi said. “Dismissal is… unlikely. It’s known he singled out Song in class, but that is not a breach of any rules. Merely reprehensible behavior. It is a jump going from that to being the accomplice in a murder plot.”

“So she has to go back to a class taught by a man who tried to get her killed?” Maryam hissed. “He’ll just get away with it?”

The man pushed up those golden spectacles, obscuring his eyes for the barest of moments.

“No,” Wen said. “Have no fear of that.”

He pushed himself off the seat, which creaked unkindly at the treatment.

“The officer tribunal should have appointed an investigator by now,” he said. “I need to speak with the garrison and make arrangements. I’ve asked Mandisa to tell Tredegar about this, but I’ve no idea where Abrascal disappeared to.”

“I do,” Maryam said. “I’ll handle it.”

“Then I am off,” Wen said.

The large man hesitated at the door, let out a sigh and turned back their way.

“You did nothing wrong, Song,” Wen said. “Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.”

He walked out without another word, leaving them listening to the silence in his wake.

# Chapter 29

Maryam stayed, as she would wish for others to stay with her in such circumstances, but it was clear Song was in no chatting mood. She seemed lost in thought, though her face was not as grim as Maryam might have expected.

Either way it was somewhat tedious to simply sit in silence, so eventually Maryam stirred herself to ask if there was anything she could for Song. Somewhat predictably, her studious captain asked for her writing kit to be fetched along with Theology books for tomorrow and what passed as light reading in the eyes of Song Ren: a fist-thick volume titled ‘Jewel of the Crown, A Comprehensive History of the Asphodel Rectorate’.

“That seems like a worse experience than the beating,” Maryam told her.

Song snorted.

“It is a bit… florid, I’ll admit, but it is the only history I could find that follows Asphodel from Morn’s Arrival to the Century of Sails.”

Maryam doubted even Asphodelans – Asphodelites? – wanted to know so much about the island they lived on, but if the Tianxi wanted to practice the scholarly equivalent of self-flagellation that was on her own head. If nothing else, the volume should help her fall asleep. The signifier headed back to the cottage and packed everything before glancing at the Orrery lights through the window. She grimaced at the sight, only now realizing how late the day was running.

She’d have time to return to the hospital then head back here in time for supper with Tristan, but not much wiggle room. The cottage was safe and close to Scholomance, but it came at the price of being far from most everything else.

Her second unpleasant surprise of the day came when she was heading down Templeward Street and ran into someone she would rather have avoided.

“Maryam,” Angharad Tredegar called out, lengthening her stride to catch up. “Please wait a moment.”

Despite the urge to ignore her, Maryam did.

“Tredegar,” she nodded with cool politeness.

“Is it true that Song was attacked?” Tredegar asked.

To her honor, the dark-skinned woman did not seem to be leaning into the quadruple murder end of the rumors. However low Tredegar’s opinion of their captain at the moment, it was evidently not that low.

“It is,” Maryam said. “She is bedridden, so I am bringing some of her belongings to the hospital.”

“I must accompany you, then,” Tredegar said.

Joy. It would please Song, though, so she’d live with it. And use the free labor that had just presented itself.

“I could use help carrying the writing kit,” Maryam subtly hinted.

Tredegar promptly volunteered to lug around the wooden box, which had been digging in the Izvorica’s back like a bony elbow for the last quarter hour. She put a spring to her step to see if she could force the Pereduri to rush, but sadly Tredegar’s longer legs and inconvenient physical fitness forced Maryam to slow down a few minutes in so she would not start panting noticeably.

It was like Captain Totec said – if you’re going to smash a skull, be careful not to drop the stone on your own foot.  A lot of the old man’s advice involved cracking skulls, now that Maryam thought of it. Either it was a staple of Izcalli sayings or Totec had gone out of his way to learn all those that mentioned it. Her musings were disrupted by a throat being cleared.

“Have you had a pleasant week?” Angharad Tredegar tried.

Maryam eyed her skeptically. The dark-skinned woman seemed uncomfortable, almost squirming.

“We don’t need to talk,” Maryam finally said.

By the look on her face, Tredegar was uncertain whether she should be feeling relieved or insulted. Maryam’s skillful deflection of small talk delivered blessed silence for the rest of the way to the hospital, only for her jaw to tighten once they reached it. That Izcalli watchman from earlier was still at the door and he once more stared at her before frowning down at her plaque for a full ten seconds. He only gestured for her to pass after the other guard got curious.

Naturally, the man barely even glanced at Tredegar’s plaque before waving her in.

That little interlude put Maryam in a foul enough mood she did not slow when the Pereduri let out a noise of surprise at the sight of the hospital hall. She kept moving, forcing Tredegar to catch up with the writing kit rattling on her back. At least the second set of guards offered equal indifference while writing their names down, so there was that. The Izvorica had learned the virtues of apathy since crossing the sea: sometimes it was the best you could hope for.

Maryam had long been disabused of the notion that the Malani were the only ones to look down on pale skin. It took different shapes, different names, claimed different reasons, but she figured the source was all the same. The lands here, Aurager – the First Empire name for the two continents it had ruled, Issa to the south and Serica to the north – knew only darklings to have pale coloring and anything else went against centuries of how they thought the world to be.

It was simpler to think of the Triglau as less than men, more comfortable, and despite their insistence they were all different mornaric all liked to stare down at the same navel. You could tell, if you listened carefully, just from the way they used the word ‘Vesper’ when really meaning ‘Aurager’. Deep down they thought of their corner of the world as the whole of it, and everything that did not neatly fit into that corner was to be despised.

The sound of the guards closing the door behind them jolted Maryam out of her morosity, back to silver eyes going wide at the sight of them. Song had been awake when they entered, busy staring at the ceiling, and now straightened against the cushions like she had been caught with a hand in the honey jar instead of simply being bored.

“Ah,” Song coughed. “Angharad, I was not expecting you.”

“Sergeant Mandisa told me of the assault,” the noblewoman solemnly replied. “I am glad to see your wounds appear minor.”

Tredegar’s eyes lingered on the bruised cheeks, her jaw clenching at the sight. There, at least, Maryam shared an opinion with her.

“Please, take a seat,” Song invited her. “You too Maryam.”

The writing kit was set aside, the books piled up on the bedside table and Maryam paid middling attention to the prompted second recounting of the ambush and how Song had survived it. Again the Tianxi remained vague on the nature of the creature Scholomance had guided into the fight, though it did not sound a devil so it must be some sort of lemure.

“They were from different cabals, I am almost certain of that,” Song was saying, answering Tredegar’s question. “The sole common thread was roots in Jigong.”

“Empty seats tomorrow should make it plain which brigade they belonged to,” the Pereduri said. “That will make obtaining reparations straightforward.”

Naïve, that.

“It won’t work like that,” Maryam said.

Eyes went to her. She cleared her throat, not having expected the attention.

“This isn’t a student squabble,” she said. “The garrison got involved, there is an official investigation and Captain Wen even mentioned a tribunal. It’s Watch business now, not some Scholomance scuffle – the hammer’s going to come down hard on everyone even slightly involved.”

“The Watch has been offhanded in such matters so far,” Tredegar pointed out.

“They gave us only three rules when we came off that boat,” Maryam replied. “If they do not strictly enforce those few lines in the sand, it will be chaos.”

Tredegar hesitated, then nodded in acknowledgement of the point. Song was Song, and therefore worried mostly of how fighting off an ambush would mar her record, but their captain wasn’t going to be the one the mud was splashed on here. Every captain who’d had a cabalist plot the murder of another student under their nose without noticing a thing was going to lose some feathers for it, as were their brigade patrons.

Normally that would have prompted fears of retaliation, but this once Maryam was inclined to believe the lot of them would be avoiding the Thirteenth like the plague for the foreseeable future. Being caught doing anything akin to doubling down on attacking Song might very well see repeat offenders killed. While the Watch tended to look the other way for small or first offences, its take on third chances was being lined up against the wall and shot.

 “Maryam is correct that this cannot be considered a personal matter any longer,” Song said. “Not with the garrison involved. I expect the Watch will see justice done on my behalf.”

Ah, clever girl. Now continuing on the warpath would mean Tredegar was questioning the honor of the Watch itself, which she would be very careful about doing. She’d keep her saber sheathed until the investigation was finished, which no doubt was Song had been after by phrasing it that way. It was the right choice: much as Maryam would enjoy watching Angharad Tredegar cut down everyone involved, it would make them the aggressors instead of the aggressed. If you wanted the king to chasten your enemies for raiding your cattle, you couldn’t raid their cattle right back.

Alas, now that Song and Tredegar were seated in the same room there was no more avoiding idle conversation. They tore into pleasantries with ferocious appetite, moving on from the weather to class readings and what this week’s Warfare class might be like. Though Maryam considered this social equivalent of having your fingernails slowly pulled out by a disinterested torturer, she took some comfort in how Tredegar was growing more and more uncomfortable as time went on.

Was the noblewoman failing to find a polite way to excuse herself? No, Maryam eventually decided. She was not glancing at the door or trying to end the talk. What she was doing was shuffle like someone whose seat was aflame. Hesitating. And while Maryam took perverse pleasure into feeding the conversation to stretch this out – have you done the Saga readings yet, very interesting stuff, did you know the Kingdom of Tariac existed before Izcalli? – Song had also noticed and the Tianxi was soft.

“You have something you want to say, Angharad,” Song said. “It seems to be weighing on you.”

Tredegar hesitated.

“The discussion need not happen today,” she said.

Ah, so it was bad and she did not want to add misery to Song’s already miserable day. For once this was eminently sensible and Maryam sympathized, but Tredegar had pulled on the wrong lever. She had just implicitly pitied Song Ren, the equivalent of tossing a torch inside a blackpowder depot.

“That is not necessary,” Song said, a tad coldly. “Speak your mind, Angharad.”

It would have been eminently petty to use such a charged moment to pick on Tredegar.

“Yes, Angharad, do speak your mind,” Maryam pleasantly smiled.

She was only human, it wasn’t her fault. Finding no ally in her quest not to further ruin everyone’s day, Tredegar sighed and took a moment to firm her resolve, squaring her shoulders.

“I have come across information about the death of Isabel Ruesta,” she said.

That infanzona girl from the Dominion? Tristan had called her poison, though one that the Cerdan brothers had swallowed so the pair had been quite cordial. There had been no deep relation there, though. She’d heard much more of the girl from Song, who had used a solid half of their secret meetings to rant on the subject.

“Have you?” Song mildly replied.

The Izvorica studied her, brow creasing. It was Song’s fighting face she was looking at, which boded ill for the rest of this conversation.

“Isabel was shot from behind,” the noblewoman flatly said. “And from the stairs. Only two stood there: Lady Ferranda Villazur and yourself.”

Maryam bit the inside of her cheek. Well now, that sounded rather close to an accusation. She eyed Song again, genuinely curious. Had she really shot the Ruesta girl? Certainly she had fumed about the infanzona when it was just the two of them, how dear Isabel had sunk her hooks in Tredegar and now kept complicating everything, but Song was not one to kill unless she felt she had good reason.

“You are leading to a question,” Song said. “Ask it.”

“Did you kill Isabel Ruesta?” Tredegar bluntly asked.

The silver-eyed Tianxi watched the other woman for a long moment, then sighed.

“Let us say that I did,” Song said. “I would have broken no oath by pulling that trigger.”

Maryam almost whistled, but she was wary of dipping even so light a toe into this conversation – they were a hair’s breadth away from each other’s throat, it would not take much to turn that tension on her instead. A full three beats of silence passed, the two matching stares.

“That is not untrue,” Tredegar finally replied, tone clipped. “After the Trial of Ruins, the truce was not explicitly established again. And your reasons for such an act?”

Song cocked her head to the side.

“Would they matter?”

Angharad Tredegar breathed in deeply.

“No,” she admitted. “They would not.”

She stiffly rose from her seat.

“I cannot be under the command of someone who slew an ally,” Tredegar said. “I will remain part of the Thirteenth in name until the month has ended, but transfer to another brigade after that.”

Maryam stilled. She had not truly expected Tredegar had it in her to walk out. To complain and bargain and settle, yes, but leave? Not after the Dominion. But then they were not the only brigade to come out of the Dominion of Lost Things were they? She had forgot that, having rubbed elbows with them so little.

“An appreciated courtesy,” Song evenly replied.

It took a second for Maryam to catch up there, to find said courtesy. Leaving at the beginning of next month gave the Thirteenth a full four weeks to find Tredegar’s replacement. If Tristan returns, Maryam suddenly thought. She was not as sure of that as she would have been minutes ago. She’d not believed Tredegar would leave either, but now that the door was open… Her stomach clenched. Just as she began to find her footing on Tolomontera, the ground turned to sand again.

“I would not consider you an enemy,” Tredegar said, “but neither will I call you friend. May you fare well, Song Ren.”

The Tianxi’s face was a blank mask. Tredegar turned towards Maryam, hesitating over what to say, so the Izvorica spared her the trouble.

“Door’s behind you,” she said with a light wave. “Don’t let it hit you on the way out.”

Maryam had been most amused the first time she heard the sentence ‘taking the high road’. In her experience, the high road was the one you took to shoot at Malani patrols from behind before disappearing into the crags.

Tredegar’s face tightened.

“Goodbye, Maryam Khaimov,” she forced out.

Maryam only cocked an eyebrow. The noblewoman spared them a stilted nod, then marched out of the room like it was a parade floor. Song stayed still as a statue, so the Izvorica gave her the courtesy she knew the other woman wanted instead of the one that was her instinct to give.

She stared at the door in silence, pretending she could not hear Song putting her composure back together one piece at a time.

“An eventful day,” Song finally said.

The signal that she had glued enough of a mask together that Maryam was allowed to look again.

“A real Dominion classic,” she replied, then paused.

Song cocked an eyebrow. It should have been cooly inquisitive, but the Izvorica could see the cracks. The only word for it was fragile.

“Did you pull the trigger?” Maryam asked.

They both knew she would not particularly care if the Tianxi had, beyond some curiosity as to what Ruesta had done to warrant it.

“It doesn’t matter,” Song said, looking away.

“Given how much Malani care about oaths, I would argue otherwise,” she said. “I won’t say Tredegar would have stayed on if you swore otherwise, but it would have muddled the waters.”

“It doesn’t matter,” Song repeated. “She hesitated to ask, Maryam.”

Her brow rose.

“And?”

“Pity stayed her hand, the desire not to darken a dark day,” Song said.  “The bedrock of that is the belief that the result would be dark, that I pulled that trigger. Angharad already believed me guilty, so all protestations otherwise would have achieved was mark me a liar in her eyes.”

Maryam frowned.

“Maybe,” she said. “But you good as confessed.”

“Had I not, she would have been honor-bound to consider both possibilities,” Song tiredly replied. “And to treat them equally, regardless of her beliefs. That would mean…”

“No joining the Thirty-First,” Maryam muttered. “Because Ferranda’s the other possibility.”

She clicked her tongue against the roof of her mouth.

“Still taking care of her even as she leaves,” the Izvorica complained.

But there was no heat in it. It was, in truth, somewhat pleasing to see that Song would continue to extend a warding hand even to those no longer under her. Regardless of whether that help was deserved or not.

“Better she come under Ferranda than be snatched up by someone less scrupulous,” Song said.

Maryam cocked her head to side.

“That and Ferranda will feel like she owes you, so you might still be able to rely on that swordarm in a pinch,” she said.

The lack of denial was telling.

“Charity need not mean naivety,” Song simply replied.

She leaned back into the pillows, bruised and exhausted.

“You will be late for supper with Tristan if you do not leave soon,” Song said. “Please convey to him I request a meeting at his earliest convenience.”

The bit about being late was true, though that was now why she said it. Maryam did not fight the dismissal. She left, and let Song lick her wounds with no one looking.

—

There were lights inside the cottage when she arrived, and the scent of something being cooked wafted out when she opened the door.

“In the kitchen,” Tristan called out.

The smell was almost enough to make her drool: rice, fried vegetables and was that garlic? She found Tristan in the kitchen, as advertised, sleeves pulled up and wearing a leather apron as he stirred the insides of a large pan. He glanced back as she slumped into a seat, humming as he set down his long wooden spoon to grab a jug and a cup from the counter. He set both down on the kitchen table before her.

“I expect that’s not wine,” Maryam said.

She had never seen him touch a drink unless it would make him stand out to refuse, and even then he only sipped.

“Pear juice,” he said. “Fresh from the harbor.”

“Sounds expensive,” she mused.

“I expect it would have been,” he said.

She squinted at him, then down at his chest, then back up to his face.

“I don’t recall us having that apron either,” Maryam noted.

“The key to getting a good price was the just stealing it,” he solemnly revealed.

She snorted and helped herself to the jug of pear juice, pulling out the cork and taking a sniff. Like it was fresh out of the orchard. A lovely treat, she thought as she poured herself a cup. Tristan returned to his pan, but by the time she was halfway through her cup he’d taken it off the fire and was pushing two generous portions off onto plates. It looked delicious, Maryam thought – rice, peas and carrots made into an almost golden bowl seasoned with onions and garlic.

“It’s better with salt,” Tristan told her as he set down the plates, “but season as you will.”

He returned with their salt pot and a set of utensils, sliding into the seat across from hers. Maryam shoveled a mouthful in and let out a noise that might have made a man less utterly disinterested in sex blush.

“Itsh goodsh,” she complimented.

He rolled his eyes.

“You know, when you told me to return for supper I did not expect to be the one doing the cooking.”

Maryam swallowed.

“I would never deprive you from the familiar comfort of being wrong,” she said.

“You’re all heart, Khaimov,” he drily replied.

“Thathsh mee,” she happily said.

After so much walking around and a dip in a layer, she was ravenously hungry. She’d polished off most of her plate by the time he was only halfway done with his, and Tristan usually tended to eat the fastest of the Thirteenth. By unspoken accord they put off the talk until their bellies were full, and as the Sacromontan finished the last of his rice Maryam put on a pot of tea. With how full she was, if she didn’t get some in her she might fall asleep at the table.

She poured them both cups of Someshwari leaf, though she knew he was unlikely to finish his so she left it half empty.

“Has the leviathan been sated?” Tristan teased.

“The leviathan would have liked dessert,” Maryam said, raising her chin, “but she will pardon the lack.”

“If the leviathan really wants those candied pistachios, she can shell out the coin for them herself,” he drawled.

“Solid pun,” she praised.

“I’ve been sitting on it for days,” he confessed.

Which was, she supposed, one approach to the matter.

“You might have been able to use it earlier,” Maryam casually said, “had we seen more of each other.”

His face tightened the slightest bit, then she watched as he forced himself to breathe out. He also killed an irritated glance to his left, meaning his goddess was likely making fun of him. She did that sometimes, when it was just the two of them. Maryam had been itching to hear it for weeks, but Tristan refused to convey messages either way. He claimed he’d be stuck playing interpreter forever if he started, which honesty compelled Maryam to admit was probably true.

“The teacher I sought was tucked away in a location that can only be accessed during hours overlapping with morning class,” Tristan said. “And it was nowhere near here to boot, so I slept out in Scraptown.”

The name begged a question, which was absolutely he’d dangled it, but she bit at the bait and asked anyway. Though he stayed somewhat vague on details, Tristan laid out his adventures of the last few days and the general area they’d taken place in. Those other Masks, she thought, sounded like a bunch of little assholes. Except that Silumko fellow, who unlike her own friend had displayed the rare good sense not to go crawling through strange layers.

Did the others also follow nice men down dark alleys when written signs told them to?

Tristan was usually wiser than that, which tugged at her unpleasantly. The thief only grew reckless when he believed himself cornered, and no matter how airily he talked of crossing the layer he had to know there had been risks. It was unlike him to take them, as was spending the amount of coin he must have to obtain the equipment he used in his story.

Poison boxes were not exactly common market fare, for one.

“So the only way in and out of the tower is through the Landing?” she asked.

Lucifer’s Landing was the thinnest of the layers around the island, according to Captain Yue, but that hardly meant it was without dangers.

“I think there might have been a physical entrance once, but it seems gone,” Tristan said. “Either way, the shortcut will rid me of much the travel time. I only need to pass through an underground shrine south of the Nettlewood.”

“Congratulations,” Maryam said. “You have both your Mask teachers for the year, sounds like.”

“Barring abduction, my stay at Scholomance is secure,” he agreed.

He’d said that casually, Maryam thought, and not in a ‘too casual’ sort of way. Unthinking, and so in a way as honest as Tristan got. And in that small sentence was, she thought, the thread to pull at. The reason he’d taken so many risks, and why she would wager he had no intention of sleeping at the cottage tonight. My stay at Scholomance is secure. Maryam sipped at her tea and marshalled her thoughts.

“Did I ever tell you how I became a signifier?” she asked.

He cocked his head to the side.

“I’d assumed your mother chose you as her apprentice,” Tristan said.

“That’s not wrong,” she said, “but it’s not right either.”

Mother had certainly never believed there was a choice to make, but Maryam had known even as a girl that the Craft was not something you could be forced into. An unwilling or halfhearted practitioner was a disaster in the making.

“I was born with the talent, but I didn’t have to become someone who practiced the Craft,” she said. “I could have been taught just enough to not hurt myself and left to walk a different path.”

Practitioners had a term for those who made that choice, tup, which meant ‘dull’ and not in a complimentary way. It would have been a blow to her mother’s reputation for Maryam to refuse the Craft, enough that she would likely have tried for a second child with Father.

“So it was your choice,” Tristan said, sounding almost surprised.

She could understand why. There was power in wielding the Gloam, but also peril. And in these lands across the sea, the Navigators had gathered all the esteem of such a profession onto themselves – those who wielded Gloam without being guildsmen were seen as halfway charlatans.

“My childhood was… complicated,” Maryam admitted. “My mother was my father’s tenth wife.”

He choked.

“That seems perhaps overly ambitious,” Tristan tried. “How would a single man even have hours enough for ten wives?”

“It wasn’t a love match, it’s not like they were joined at the hip,” she said, rolling her eyes. “After Mother became pregnant they only met a few times a year.”

“An alliance match, then?” he asked.

“Something like that,” Maryam said. “Mother was the youngest member of the Ninefold Nine in a century, but she came from nothing. She needed backing. Father, well, he wanted the prestige of so famous a wife and a scary stick to shake at his trade rivals. It was a pleasing arrangement for both.”

She had heard marriage was used to make alliances in Sacromonte as well, though strangely only one spouse at a time. That seemed odd to her. If marrying for advantage, why stop at one? It was rare for a ruler to need to tie only a single ally by blood.

“And the Ninefold Nine were…”

“The society that rules over those who practice the Craft among the Izvorica,” Maryam said, then grimaced. “Ruled, anyway. Anyone who wants to learn the Craft has to be initiated, and from that number eighty-one souls are elected to decide which practices are outlawed and serve as a tribunal over practitioners who commit crimes. It is a great honor.”

Tristan’s eyes narrowed as he parsed through that.

“So within your father’s house, your mother would have been too strong to ignore but too weak to ward off the other wives,” he resumed.

That was… distressingly close to the reality of it, Maryam thought. Ever sharp, Tristan. Some of the other mothers had been born to landowners or the wealthy traders, and while they had feared Mother’s strength in the Craft they’d had weapons of their own to wield. That and Mother’s power had not always been an advantage – sicknesses and accidents had been blamed on her ‘curses’ quite often, when Maryam was young. She nodded.

“It was not clear where I stood when compared to the other children,” she said. “And several were close to me in age.”

She did not need to tell Tristan what kind of nastiness that would bring about.

“They were not kind in our childish arguments, and neither was I,” Maryam said. “Someone almost lost an eye. In the end, Mother and I were made to live away from the others.”

“I cannot tell if that is the mark of a victory or defeat,” Tristan noted.

Maryam shrugged. Looking back, she thought it might be a little of both.

“As a girl, it felt like the latter,” she said. “Like my own father had cast me out.”

“So you turned to your mother instead, and with her the Craft,” Tristan said.

She nodded.

“Years later, I learned the separation had been meant to stand for a few seasons only,” Maryam told him. “Until tempers had cooled. Come the following spring I was to have lessons along with my siblings closest in age, to foster ties.”

She sighed.

“Only I had chosen the Craft by then,” Maryam said. “My lessons were my mother alone, and it would have been unsafe for a young practitioner to sleep under the same roof as others. We stayed away.”

She shrugged.

“As for my siblings, from then on I spoke to them only a few times a year at feasts and never knew any of them beyond courtesies,” she said. “They were strangers.”

Maryam sipped at her tea, gone from nearly scalding to barely warm. Her lips were dry, it was pleasing to wet them.

“It was not something I grieved,” she admitted. “But now that they are dead, I look back on those children’s arguments and they feel… petty. A small thing, compared to the possibilities they cost us.”

Gray eyes studied her.

“Ah,” he said.

“Ah?”

“Ah,” he repeated.

She waited, but he said nothing else.

“I expected more,” Maryam admitted.

He sighed.

“I like learning about you,” Tristan said. “It – we know each other, I think, or at least understand each other. But stories like this fill the painting, and I enjoy that as well.”

“But?” Maryam said.

“When is a gift not a gift?” he asked. “When it is a tool.”

The blue-eyed woman winced.

“That was not a recounting of your childhood, that was you asking me to let the matters with Song go.”

Ever sharp, Tristan. Even when it was inconvenient.

“Not let go,” Maryam laid out. “Only to hear her out. She asks for a meeting. And there is a situation that-”

“The quadruple murder, yes,” Tristan mildly interrupted. “Jigong students that saw an opening, I imagine?”

Maryam hesitated a moment, then nodded. There was no point in denying it.

“I must be a potent curse indeed, to continue endangering her even when on the other side of the city,” the thief scathingly said.

The Izvorica’s jaw clenched.

“She almost died, Tristan.”

“So did I, after we followed her into the fucking terror pit,” he sharply replied. “That did not stop her from coming after me with everything short of a knife.”

“Which she regrets,” Maryam stressed. “And wants to apologize for.”

“Oh, come off it,” the thief scorned. “The brigade fell apart and now she had a close call so suddenly regrets grow in the garden of Song? That’s convenient.”

“She genuinely regrets how she acted that night, Tristan,” Maryam said. “I do not say this to play peacemaker – I truly believe it.”

Maybe not entirely for the right reasons, but Song did regret it.

“She regrets slipping up,” Tristan corrected. “Because it was beneath her, because it cost her. But we all had a look at what lies under the politeness, that night, and I am not going to pretend otherwise because she makes a few stilted apologies.”

That was… not untrue, but incomplete. And somewhat unkind.

“I don’t think you understand what her situation is,” Maryam said. “She-”

“I don’t care,” Tristan honestly replied. “About her reasons or why she’s the way she is. She is not my friend, Maryam. I spoke in anger that night, but I don’t think I was wrong.”

He leaned in.

“I am tired of her walking around peering at everyone’s secrets, reading our contracts and spying on our gods, while even acknowledging that she’s fucking doing it is somehow a line too far,” Tristan bit out. “She commands and demands with eye to her personal advance and nothing else. I might be able to forgive that, if at least we were going from victory to victory, but our record is a pit.”

“We are two weeks into the year,” Maryam said. “And I do not blame you for it, but you have to know some of those troubles followed you to the Thirteenth.”

This was slipping through her fingers, damn it. She had not wanted to have to accuse him, anything that would have her ‘choosing’ Song, but she was being forced to turn after turn.

“Just as troubles followed her,” Tristan countered. “That was the nature of the arrangement, mutual protection. For that purpose she tolerated me and I tolerated her. There is no deeper kinship there, Maryam. I owe her nothing.”

Her fingers clenched.

“I’m not asking you to forgive her,” Maryam said. “I’m asking you to hear her out.”

“Why?” Tristan bluntly asked.

She blinked.

“Why?”

“Why are you always cleaning up behind her?” he challenged.

“She would do this in person if she was not bedridden,” Maryam said. “I only-”

“You’re being obtuse,” he said. “Why are you going out on a limb on her behalf, when you were angry with her that night as well? Not like I was, perhaps, but you were. I could tell.”

She had been angry, he wasn’t wrong about that. That Song had not said a word when Tredegar called her useless, that she’d not said a word when the Pereduri phrased their older and deeper ties involving knowledge of a curse she helped manage as somehow an insult. Mostly she had been angry that Song kept bending over backwards to the other woman while the rest of them had to work for what they got. Yet these had not been deep cuts, not like Song and Tristan dealt each other.

And knowing that Song was trying, to mend things and to understand, had restored some of her faith in what the Thirteenth could still be.

“She’s my friend and she’s in pain,” Maryam quietly said.

His face closed.

“Pity is not a plan,” Tristan said, and his words had someone else’s cadence to them.

“You are angry, and have reason to be,” Maryam said. “Can you not also concede that she had reason to be angry with you?”

A moment passed.

“I could,” he admitted. “But I look into myself, Maryam, and all I find is a question: why should I bother?”

“Because it’s the only way the Thirteenth will keep,” she hissed out angrily. “And you just…”

Her fists clenched. Silence stretched out between them.

“Tredegar left, didn’t she?” Tristan finally said. “You sound too raw.”

“Just before I came here,” Maryam confessed.

“Unexpected,” he admitted, “but I can’t say it moves the needle for me. You know how it goes with rats and sinking ships.”

“So that’s what it comes down to?” she bitterly asked. “I must choose one of you and leave the other one behind.”

He raised an eyebrow.

“Will I somehow become a stranger if we are not in the same brigade?” Tristan challenged. “Stick with Song, if you want to stake your chances at Scholomance on pity instead of sense – I’ll not be pleased at the choice, but neither will I disappear.”

“You sound like your decision is already made,” Maryam said.

“I do not think it impossible to join another brigade,” Tristan honestly replied. “I come with some trouble, but I am also a Mask positioned to graduate with useful skills. I do not need the Thirteenth.” 

My stay at Scholomance is secure, he’d said. It sunk in, slowly but surely, that Tristan had not hurled himself into a layer and spent most of his coin simply because he felt like he needed a victory. He’d done it, Maryam realized, for courage.

He’d done it so he would be able to have this conversation with her and not flinch.

I’m too late, she realized. She was not weighing on the scales of a choice, she was trying to turn back the clock on a decision he had already made. Tristan had felt himself trapped, shoved into the grave, and he’d clawed his way out. Now he could not care less what happened to the coffin he’d been buried in. You decided Song is an enemy, Maryam thought. Not the knives out kind, but someone to work around instead of with.

From the beginning she had been going about this wrong. There was no point in trying to make him sympathize with Song, because for all that he called himself a thief he saw things much like the warriors Maryam had once ridden with. Those that put on the armor for life, not for seasons or reasons. Those who learned to look into the eyes of the warriors on the shield wall on the other side and not see men, because you couldn’t see men and cut them down without losing sleep.

Once Tristan Abrascal decided you were an enemy, sympathy no longer weighed on the scales. Pity was not a plan, as he’d put it.

Maryam breathed in. It was not all lost. Much like with those warriors, he did not see enmity as… personal, in a way? It was just the way of the world, and did not mean hate. You could trade with opponents, even work with them. Maryam just had to make this all transactional.

“Do you have another brigade lined up?” she bluntly asked.

That gave him pause.

“No,” he said. “I have only begun to consider possibilities.”

“Then stay with us until the end of the month,” Maryam said. “Tredegar’s doing the same.”

His eyes narrowed at the ‘us’, but she would not pretend. She was not abandoning Song. Tristan would be fine without her in the same brigade, but Song might well crumble.

“I can agree to that,” Tristan said.

“And I want you to hear her out anyway,” Maryam said.

He did not answer, only watching her with calm gray eyes.

“You both know some of the other’s secrets,” she reminded him. “If you are to part ways, formalize an arrangement first. And while you do, what does it cost you to listen to what she has to say?”

Maryam saw him weigh costs and advantages, how he lost time in exchange for departing the Thirteenth on better terms and throwing her a sop besides. For the first time Tristan sipped at his tea, though it had to be cold by now.

“All right,” he said. “Tomorrow, then.”

It was the best Maryam would get, so she took it.

—

Things still felt unfinished with Tristan.

They’d gnawed at the bone of Song for long Maryam felt there was an entire conversation they’d missed. It was why she insisted he sleep at the cottage this time, and said she would be doing the same. She only needed to swing by the hospital to check on Song one last time and mention to her that Tristan was still alive. It took some coaxing, but her honest admission that she might head to the Meadow to sleep if the cottage was empty clinched the matter.

It also left her to feel like she was pulling at an increasingly tattered rope, a sensation she did not enjoy in the least. No, there was still a talk remaining between them.

Song had the Asphodel history in her lap but she wasn’t snoring when Maryam arrived, which she had to concede was impressive. Part of her felt like she should tease the Tianxi about the reading, but when she dropped into the chair by the bed she found herself too tired. Wan, like there was no banter left in her.

“I take it,” Song said, “that the conversation did not go well.”

“He’s at the cottage, alive and will attend class tomorrow,” Maryam said. “That is the sum whole of the goods new I have to bring you.”

“He refused a meeting?” Song asked, seeming genuinely surprised.

“No,” she admitted. “It’s not that. It’s…”

Maryam licked her lips.

“Then he wants to leave the Thirteenth as well,” the Tianxi quietly said.

“That’s a symptom of the sickness more than anything,” Maryam replied. “I didn’t understand how he took the argument that night. I expect my leaving didn’t help, looking back.”

He would have been alone in a house with a woman he considered an enemy. No wonder he had fallen back on his habits from the slums of Sacromonte – if there was no one to watch his back, he could only press it to the wall.

“Yet he agreed to hear me out,” Song slowly said.

“You are being managed,” Maryam bluntly said. “Or the situation, rather. The way he sees it, he’s just agreed to go through the motions.”

“As long as he sits across from me, I can attempt to convince him,” Song said. “If I cannot, that is my failure.”

“You can’t think of it like that,” she said. “That’s a dead end, Song. He’ll trade, because he’d trade with Lucifer himself if the bargain was solid. But that’s transactional. It’s not trust, and trust is what you need if you want him to stay.”

At which point her gaze turned on the Tianxi. She had been fighting one front of this war all this time, but hardly given a thought to the other. Assumptions had already bitten her once tonight, so she silently asked Song the only question that mattered.

“I do,” she said. “It is… I made mistakes. Sought to put him to my purposes while balking at granting him the same. But surely time and bargains would win trust?”

It won’t, Maryam thought. What Song described was not unlike how she had befriended Tristan on the Dominion, but part of her knew that was no fair measure. Friendship with him had been like turning the key in a lock. There had been the satisfying heft of something happening, snapping into place, but the pieces had fit from the start. Besides Maryam had never been an enemy, even when she wore a mask and called herself Sarai. She’d not been trying to claw her way out of the pit.

“It won’t move the needle,” Maryam quietly said, echoing his words. “You need…”

She frowned.

“You need to bleed,” she finally admitted. “To pay a price upfront and for his sake, something he can’t just rationalize as an exchange of favors. You have to smash expectations or you’re staying in that pit forever.”

“That seems excessive,” Song carefully said.

And she couldn’t help it, she laughed.

“It’s just,” Maryam snorted. “You, of all people, saying that.”

“I don’t follow,” the Tianxi said.

“You did the exact same thing to him,” she pointed out. “It’s part of how this got so bad, I think. At some point you decided you’d figured him out and you haven’t had a good look at him since.”

Song’s lips thinned.

“I did him wrong, I will not argue that,” she said. “But while I have been painting him in darker colors than warranted, you are no more without blinders than I.”

“He’s my friend and I trust him,” Maryam acknowledged. “But I trust him because I know him.”

“You met him mere months ago,” Song gently said.

“The same is true for you,” she replied, “but unlike you, during that time I saw him at both his best and his ragged edge. There’s a lot about him I don’t know, and it may be I never will, but I know him.”

She leaned back into her seat.

“And you’re going to hate hearing this, but he’s a lot like you.”

Which said some particular things about her taste in friends but was no less true for it. Song stayed silent for a long moment.

“I will require an explanation for that,” she finally said.

“You sort people the moment you see them,” Maryam said. “Not the way Tredegar does, looking at their birth and putting them in the matching box, but you still sort them. People who can help you and people who can’t.”

“So does everyone,” Song quietly replied.

“I’m not throwing stones, Song,” she said. “The trouble is that once you put someone in the bad box, you never let them leave it. You don’t give second chances.”

The Tianxi did not answer. Which was, in a way, the only answer needed.

“For him, there’s those who are a threat and those who aren’t,” Maryam said. “Only on his bad side, you don’t get dismissed – you get measured for a knife in the throat or poison in your tea, because the moment someone can kill him he thinks he has to treat them like they will.”

“And our… altercation made me a threat,” Song slowly said.

“You’re an enemy now,” Maryam said. “That’s what I saw when I spoke with him tonight. And I can ask him to act like you’re not, but that’s not truly going to change his mind. Just make him pretend.”

She sighed, passing a hand through her hair.

“If I could fix it, I would,” she said. “But I can’t, Song. It’s you who must dig your way out, and I love him but he’s going to be a right shit about it. He wants to be right about you, so you have to prove him so wrong he can only swallow it.”

The Tianxi looked down at her hands, hesitating.

“I have not been wary of him without cause,” Song said. “I can see his goddess and she-”

“Don’t,” Maryam curtly said. “It’s not about reasons, one of you being right and the other wrong. I wouldn’t care even if it was Lucifer himself whispering advice into his ear. Relations aren’t an argument they’re…”

She struggled for the word.

“Trade,” she said. “Good coin and bad, what you want and give. And even if you owed a debt to the Black Goat herself it would still be debt. It has to be paid back.”

Song laughed.

“Zunyan,” she ruefully said.

Maryam frowned.

“Dignity,” she translated. “In Cathayan.”

“It is not a simple word, for my people,” Song said. “When Master Shijiang wrote the Fangzi Yontu – the Purpose of the House – he wrote as a mason trying to understand why the house known as Cathay had collapsed upon our heads. His answer was the imbalance of zunyan.”

“An imbalance of dignity?” Maryam frowned. “He thought the world needed more politeness?”

“Why is the face of a prince worth more than that of a beggar?” Song asked, voice cadenced. “The wheel turns without end; across eternity all souls will be high and low. To honor a single life is as building a wall with a single stone. The only universal truth is the equal dignity of souls, and to refuse this is to deny the Circle Perpetual itself.”

The Izvorica sucked in a breath.

“Noble can’t have liked that,” she said.

“He spent most of his life in exile,” Song quietly said. “But if the words of the Feichu Tian are the mind of what it means Tianxi, then those of the Fangzi Yontu are the heart.”

She grimaced.

“I have not given Tristan Abrascal the zunyan that is his due.”

“He hasn’t been a darling to you either,” Maryam gently said.

“That cannot, should not weigh on the scales,” Song replied. “A universal principle does not bend to circumstance.”

The Tianxi swallowed.

“And in that spirit, I something to tell you.”

Maryam’s brow rose.

“I’m listening.”

“You saved me,” Song said.

“A lovely thought,” Maryam began, “but-”

“I do not mean it figuratively,” the Tianxi said. “The entity I told Captain Wen intervened when I was about to be tortured to death? It resembled you like a sister and claimed to be there on your behalf. It tore through the three of them like paper.”

Maryam swallowed.

“It,” she slowly said, licking her lips, “it killed people?”

“First it made them turn on each other,” Song said. “Then it popped one’s head like a grape and fed the last to a ‘smok’ made of Gloam.”

That… those weren’t Signs, at least not the latter two. They sounded like Craft.

“It shouldn’t be capable of using Gloam,” Maryam whispered. “Not if it’s some sort of parasite.”

Which meant Captain Yue was wrong.

“I have no idea what it was,” she admitted. “I need to talk to my mentor.”

The Tianxi nodded.

“The creature, she said things,” Song quietly said. “Revealed secrets you have not chosen to share.”

Maryam licked her lips nervously.

“Tell me.”

A moment’s hesitation.

“She called herself the last princess of Volcesta.”

The pale-skinned girl let out a startled laugh.

“That’s,” she began, then shook her head. “True, narrowly enough? My father was the king of Volcesta, but that title doesn’t mean the same thing it does on this side of the sea – and my mother was not his first wife, besides. I had almost twenty half-siblings who lived to adulthood.”

Maryam passed a hand though her hair, only she found her fingers curling like claws.

“I am the last of them, as far as I know, so that part stands,” she quietly admitted. “Not that Volcesta exists anymore. The Malani renamed it Ifanje and the High Queen appointed a lord to rule the city.”

“But you were a princess,” Song insisted.

Frustration rose sharply. Mornaric just couldn’t seem to understand that their tyrant-kings weren’t what everyone else meant by the word – none of the sailing peoples save the Izcalli ever seemed to grasp a king might not be some all-powerful autocrat. Father had been checked by the Staresine, whose consent he would need to wage war or raise new taxes, and had no right to pass judgement over landholders and practitioners of the Craft. He could not even choose his own successor, only pick candidates for the Staresine to elect from!

“The word doesn’t translate,” Maryam said. “In Antigua, it implies status. A title. In Recnigvor it just means…”

She struggled to find the meaning.

“Ruler’s blood,” she settled on. “It is a qualification, not a position. And being my mother’s child disqualified me from inheritance anyhow, so it is debatable whether I even warranted it.”

Like most of the Triglau, the Izvorica had once been ruled by lines of Craft-Queens who plied their powers over Gloam and spirits to rule with an iron fist. The bloody, endless feuds of that era had led to the forbidding of Crafters ruling over others and the founding of the Ninefold Nine as a union and tribunal. Being the daughter of a mistress of the Craft as infamous as Izolda Cernik would likely have seen Maryam refused the right to inherit even if she had not proved capable of the Craft as well.

Certainly, if her name had been put forward to rule of Volcesta the Staresine would have accused Father of committing davanje zaba – putting forward an obviously bad pick so they were left with only one real choice to elect. Song studied her for a long moment, then slowly nodded.

“Wintersworn?”

Maryam grimaced.

“The name of my mother’s host, taking the war to the Malani,” she said. “It is… a complicated matter.”

And she had no taste for getting into a talk about what swearing yourself to Winter meant, or the price it exacted.

“Keeper of Hooks,” Song continued. “First and last of the Ninefold Nine.”

Maryam rolled her eyes.

“Did she call herself Queen of the Third too, while at it?” she said. “It’s nonsense. The Ninefold Nine were, well, my people’s Akelarre Guild.”

Her teeth clenched.

“I was inducted into the society as a girl and might well be the last such to draw breath, but the Ninefold Nine are long buried,” Maryam said. “Most were butchered by the Malani and the rest took their own lives.”

She looked away, after that, and got what she hoped for: Song did not dare ask about the title of Keeper of Hooks. Maryam would rather not speak of her first and deepest failure, how utterly she had miscarried the hopes of her mother. That title was hers, by dint of the lack of contender for it, but even hearing the words burned like acid.

Centuries of knowledge, of wisdom, all turned to smoke because she was not good enough.

“She claimed your mother could weave a leshy out of Gloam that was large as a ship,” Song tried, a tad more lightly.

“By the end of the war, she could,” Maryam acknowledged. “Her might in the Craft was a match for the old legends.”

The blue-eyed girl hesitated.

“But by then she had grown… volatile,” she said. “The ritual that empowered her had cruel costs.”

The twenty-nine souls had begun blending into hers and each other, leaving her half mad and talking to herselves. The elects that had survived the Malani raid on the sacred grove had taken their lives willingly, giving their power and wisdom, but no mortal was meant to bear the weight of so many lives. The only pure thing left in her had been the rage, so it was rage that ruled the roost.

Silence stretched out between them, Song having finally run out of uncomfortably intimate knowledge about her past. Or at least of willingness to keep discussing it.

“It is a strange thing,” Song quietly said, “to know so little about you and still feel I know you.”

“The past is past,” Maryam replied.

Silence.

“No,” Song said. “It’s not that. I think I know the shape of your wounds, Maryam, and you mine. It is a little like being in someone’s confidence, to see the scars the world left on them.”

She swallowed, uncomfortable as the soft words. Unsure she could deny them.

“What are you going to do?” Maryam asked.

Song closed her eyes.

“I am going to burn a bridge with the Forty-Ninth still on it,” she said. “I am going to rob their corpse of everything of worth, and then I will buy trust with blood – theirs, mine, everyone else’s.”

She breathed out.

“And when you tell Captain Yue of the apparition that saved me,” Song whispered, “tell her one more thing. The boon of my contract is to ‘see the truth of things’, and at the heart of that entity I saw a soul.”

# Chapter 30

Angharad clutched her saber as she strode out of the hospital.

Her knuckles all but turned white around the grip. The noblewoman’s teeth were clenched, her back straight and she ignored the smiling man by the door as she exited into the red-and-gold Orrery lights. It would have been simpler to simply be angry, but it was not so simple as that.

Well, Maryam being boorish was but not the rest.

Angharad marched past the guards and the pavement, hewing close to the dock wall as she chewed on the thorns she was being made to swallow. Song Ren had not, by words exact, broken with honor when killing Isabel Ruesta. The truce had been implicit, not sworn to, and though killing one fighting on the same side during a battle was reprehensible it was not necessarily dishonorable. There were precedents, if one cared to look for them.

On the other hand, Song had shot her own ally to death. It would be just and honorable for Angharad to kill her for that.

Only that was not whole of the matter either, was it? Weighing on the balance was that Song Ren had saved her life on more than one occasion, fought for Angharad’s safety and offered her a place at Scholomance. By principles alone this should change nothing, but… The Pereduri tugged up the collar of her coat and headed eastwards, along the shore.

She was not Queen Branwen, so embodying honor that she would keep rising from the dead so long as she never sullied it. It changed things some, their history. Song was not some cackling oathbreaker gone pirate, she was a respectable woman who had saved Angharad’s life on more than one occasion. The balance of duty and debt here was as a weathervane.

If she had said anything, explained herself… No, that might have been worse. Another secret being kept behind her back, known to all the Thirteenth save her. More smiles at her expense. The only certainty in all this was that Angharad could not remain under the command of Isabel Ruesta’s killer, so on that much she had acted.

To simply walk out of the Thirteenth tonight would punish more than Song, and neither Tristan nor Maryam – despite the latter’s best efforts – deserved it, so waiting in name until the end of the month was an acceptable compromise. The breach in honor would have been if she continued taking orders from Song, not by dint of some paper still deeming her subordinate to the Tianxi.

Chewing on her own anger, she looked up and realized she had no idea where she was. Near the docks, by the look of the wall, but she must have walked past the greater length of them without realizing it. Best turn back now, she figured, and cut north.

Angharad strode through the gutted remains of an old warehouse, gait still weighed with anger. The bones of the ruin allowed through stripes of golden light, like precious ribs painted on the ground. Only when she reached the doorway did she catch a snippet from the distant din of the Triangle. Her steps slowed to a halt, Angharad stopping before a long-empty doorway. She hesitated, as if stepping through would be a gesture of any meaning at all, and breathed in.

Her thoughts circled like vultures, each eager to tear off a stripe.

“Acts undertaken on the Dominion are under amnesty,” Angharad reminded the dark, and herself. “Song has not committed a crime.”

She was allowed to be angry over it, but only so much. The line had been walked and the Watch – who now carried her honor, as she carried the Watch’s – had deemed Song’s action no crime. Her fingers tightened around her uncle’s saber until the leather creaked.

It was a silly, foolish thing to feel betrayed. She hardly knew Song, for all the favor the other woman had shown her. Angharad had thought she learned a lesson on trust from the Dominion, but evidently she had not learned it whole. The details had all been there for her to put together, if she cared to look, but she had never thought to suspect Song at all. Because it meant suspicion of someone she respected.

It stung, the implication that she had not been respected back.

“Angharad?”

She was startled enough she almost drew her blade, turning to see a familiar face peeking through the doorway on the other side of the warehouse . Zenzele Duma, a bag tucked away against the belt tightening his regular uniform, looked as surprised to see her as she was him.

“Zenzele,” she replied, then remembered her manners. “Well met.”

“And you,” he said. “I thought you went to visit Song.”

“I just left the hospital,” she stiffly replied.

That mismatched gaze studied her a moment. He was all too seeing, for a man with only one true eye.

“And now you look fit to chew nails,” he observed. “Where are you headed?”

She looked away, the anger that had been in her bones melting away under scrutiny. It left little but weariness behind.

“Back to the Rainsparrow, I think,” Angharad exhaled.

“You might find that a slow trip,” he casually said. “There is something of a ruckus in the Triangle at the moment and the garrison is out in force. Some robbery went wrong and an officer was assaulted.”

Her brow rose. Ill news. She had thought Tolomontera largely free of crime, to the extent that Tristan’s petty thievery might represent a significant portion of what took place.

“Roadblocks?” she asked.

“Only inspections for now, but the lines for them are long,” he said. “If you have nothing better to do, you could accompany me in taking care of this. It will some time until it calms down, at least.”

He patted the bag at his side.

“And what is it ‘this’?” she asked, cocking an eyebrow.

He slid out the bag and tossed it her way. Snatching it out of the air, she pulled open the ropes just enough to get a look inside. She paused, unsure how to react.

“Breadcrumbs?” she finally asked.

He laughed.

“Come,” Zenzele said. “I’ll show you.”

—

It was not a long walk to their destination, just a few minutes eastward past the docks into a part of Allazei that the Watch had not judged fit to rebuild: row after row of ruins, reclaimed by nature’s greedy claws.

There was nothing obviously different about the house Zenzele led them into. The middle of the roof had collapsed, allowing through Orrery light, and nature swallowed most of what lay within. Tiles were covered with earth, weeds and thick moss while flowering vines covered the walls and what had once been the hearth now jutted out of a shallow pond like it was a decorative statue.

Zenzele’s reasons for carrying a sack of breadcrumbs were finally revealed: there was a family of ducks splashing about.

Bodied in a shade of ruddy brown with a black tail and a black head, the latter with a thick white stripe, they let out trills ending in an almost comical dry squawk as they welcomed their patron’s arrival. A repeat performance, was it? There were four ducklings with the adults, little balls of ruddy fuzz with two yellowish strips near the bill that made them look like pastry puffs. Their squeaks were high-pitched as they paddled about.

“That is dangerously adorable,” Angharad conceded.

Zenzele chuckled and guided her to a bench by the pond that, by the vine scars on it, had been stolen back from nature and cleaned off before being plopped down there. They sat and the Malani put down the bag between them, leaving the strings open. He threw the first handful, the ducklings racing each other to the shore and pushing each other off in their eagerness to feed.

“Do you happen to know the breed?” she asked.

“Alas, my knowledge of Lierganen ducks is sparse,” Zenzele confessed. “I can tell you that they disdain peanuts and love breadcrumbs, but little more.”

Angharad threw a handful of crumbs at the starvelings, which convinced one of the parents to make shore and peck at the mud. Though the entire affair was somewhat noisy, it did not feel like an imposition on the senses – more like being at a festival than a small, cramped room in a cottage while everyone emptied sacs of venom.

They kept feeding the ducks handful after handful, until the mother tried to slide her beak into the bag and Zenzele laughingly withdrew it out of her reach. This was, the duck swiftly conveyed, outrageous and unacceptable. She only realized how much she had been grinning when her cheeks began to ache.

“Thank you,” Angharad spoke out of the blue. “This was… not what I expected, but no less welcome for it.”

“I find the little joys in life to be most effective, when distracting yourself from the great sorrows,” Zenzele said, eyes on the ducks.

The mother, displeased at the lack of success delivered by her cacophonous campaigning, returned to the water to brood while the ducklings continued to beg for crumbs. The pair provided, one after the other. Zenzele Duma asked nothing, which Angharad thought was why she was tempted to talk. Had he asked, it would have felt like an interrogation. This felt like the opposite.

“I have decided to leave the Thirteenth,” she said.

He did not glance her way, instead nudging back a too-adventurous duckling with his boot. It squeaked in protest.

“May I ask why?”

She hesitated. The urge was there to simply tell him everything, but there would be a line there. Song had never outright confessed, which would make laying Isabel’s death at her feet supposition stated as fact. Too close to a lie for comfort.

“Song acted in a way I cannot condone,” Angharad finally said. “I do not wish to remain under her command.”

Zenzele hummed. He took his time answering.

“It is different from what we were taught, the Watch,” he said. “The duty is respectable, but the rooks themselves are not always deserving of such esteem.”

“There has been more corruption and venality than I expected,” Angharad murmured. “Much more, to be frank. I pledged an oath, and that will not change, but…”

“It is disappointing in some ways,” Zenzele finished, then waited a beat. “I once had a conversation not so dissimilar with my older brother, back in Malan, when he was on leave from the royal army.”

Zenzele Duma, she recalled, was the third-born of five. She had not known if those siblings were brothers or sisters, never thought to ask.

“He found corruption in the royal army?” Angharad frowned. “But they are…”

 She gestured vaguely, but he understood her fine.

“The High Queen’s own blades, yes,” the nobleman said. “It seemed absurd to him that soldiers fighting under Her Perpetual Majesty’s own banner would lessen themselves in such a way. But he brought home tales of graft and bribery, of beatings and cliques.”

The dark-skinned man tossed the ducks a few breadcrumbs.

“Where there is coin there is malfeasance,” Zenzele said. “It was this way before the High Queen bound the Isles together and will remain so until the Sleeping God wakes. I think it wiser to look instead at what an assembly of men is meant to accomplish and judge them by whether they fall short of that.”

Angharad, for the barest of heartbeats, was reminded of society evenings in the Middle Isle. How the nobly born could have two conversations while speaking only one set of words, meanings behind meanings. Only Zenzele was not trying to corner her, to convey some sort of threat or boast, but was… extending a hand, using the same ways. Allowing her to choose whether she wanted to read into what he had said, matching the meaning to her parting of ways with Song.

Angharad looked at Zenzele Duma and thought she might be beginning to understand what the diplomats of the Watch had seen in him.

“It was not a crime, or strictly speaking a failing as a captain,” Angharad acknowledged. “The matter is a private one. Not something I can compromise over.”

If she did not draw the line at murdering an ally, where would she draw it?

“Trust is the foundation of a cabal,” Zenzele said. “Once that is gone, there is little left to hold it together.”

And the Thirteenth, she thought, had precious little of it to go around.

“It has been frustrating,” Angharad said, the words slipping out by themselves. “All of it. Ancestors, I cannot believe I am about to say this but Tristanhas been the most dependable of the lot.”

The known thief who dabbled with poisons.

“Abrascal can be relied on to be Abrascal,” the Malani snorted. “That is to say, a man I would trust to keep his word but not leave unattended around the nice cutlery.”

“I did not realize it at first, but I believe he stole that cloak Maryam wears everywhere,” Angharad said. “She outright told me, too, only she made it sound like a jest.”

‘At that price it was a robbery’, indeed. It had taken Angharad much too long to put that one together, but she eventually had. And would have earlier, had it not been Maryam speaking the words. Angharad been too disinclined to question the rare spot of amiability to- she breathed in, breathed out. She reached for the bag and fed the ducks.

“I have not been getting along with Maryam,” she admitted once she felt calm again.

“You are from a famous sailing family and she is Triglau,” Zenzele said. “Cordiality, I imagine, must already feel like a concession on her end.”

“One she has not always been in the mood to make,” Angharad darkly said.

She clenched her fingers.

“Yet I have also given her offense, as was made plain to me,” the Pereduri admitted. “I have since been at a loss as how to balance these affairs.”

A pause.

“She is Izvorica, not Triglau,” she added. “A people within the greater region, as I understand it.”

Zenzele inclined his head in acknowledgement.

“I know precious little of the northern lands save what I learned at the isikole, which I expect differs from her own knowledge,” he said. “Still, it can be said Malan has been at war with her people for the better part of a century. Those are not easy waters to navigate.”

She slid a look his way.

“But.”

“It is a mistake to attempt to navigate these waters at all,” Zenzele frankly said. “Neither of us have answer to give to the ills that were inflicted on the – Izvorica?”

Angharad nodded.

“Izvorica,” he repeated. “Conquest is ugly business, Angharad, and while war need not be evil it always carries the seeds of evil within it. A woman who saw that darkness unleashed on her people argues not about rights and lines on a map but against the blood and screams of her kin.”

He paused.

“There is no good outcome to speaking of the subjugation of the northern lands with Maryam Khaimov,” Zenzele said. “The first lesson our teacher in the diplomatic arts taught us was that the conversations you choose not to have are just as important as those you do.”

“That is not unwise, for someone who sees her only on occasion,” Angharad evenly said. “However, she and I lived under the same roof.”

And it was not as if she had gone out of her way to discuss the colonies, or even the Izvorica for that matter.

“The second lesson,” Zenzele gently said, “was that diplomacy is an exercise of trust. That it takes time. If there are no ties between nations when they are away from the negotiating table, a treaty becomes nothing more than an elaborate rag.”

“So it was my fault,” Angharad frowned.

Not what she wanted to hear, but coming from Zenzele Duma it was an opinion she was bound to consider.

“To think it terms of fault is a dead end,” he replied. “Different actions – from her as well as from you – might have resulted in a better relation. This did not happen. Pointing fingers does nothing to change this outcome.”

A pause.

“Decide what you want, what you are willing to give for it and what steps might best deliver that end,” Zenzele said. “The rest is distractions.”

“That does not sound like the way Malan practices diplomacy,” Angharad noted.

“It is not,” he said. “But I find that the Watch’s approach has a certain… pragmatic clarity to it that refreshing to practice.”

Angharad leaned forward, elbows on her knees, and let her gaze trail across the jostling ducklings. What did she want? Searching herself, she found the answer to be shallow. Politeness was rather the extent of it. She did not particularly want to befriend Maryam, who must have qualities but had shown Angharad little save sourness. The Pereduri had no real taste for sailing those ‘difficult waters’ again, and it was somewhat relieving to grasp did she not have to.

Maryam was not some ghost haunting her, she was entirely avoidable and they would both find their days lighter for it. The Thirteenth was not a cage, the door had been open the whole time. She had simply lacked the willingness to walk out.

“Were I to make inquiries with Ferranda,” she began.

“Yes,” Zenzele cut in, then leaned back. “You have been as a cabalist to us these last few days, anyhow.”

That too-sharp gaze lingered.

“But you will not be staying with us, will you?”

She felt a little uncomfortable at being caught out before she could say it, but she would not lie.

“Is it really a fresh start, if I merely move from one group of Dominion survivors from another?” she quietly asked.

“It could be,” he said. “But I would not blame you for choosing something I considered myself.”

She started in surprise, turning to watch his face. It was calm, but there was a tightness around the eyes.

“I had no idea,” Angharad said. “The three of you seemed so close on the Dominion, I assumed…”

“It was grief that pulled us together,” Zenzele quietly said. “I wondered, for a time, whether it was truly wise to embrace such a thing. If to begin anew with strangers would not be better.”

“Yet you decided against it,” she said.

He breathed out.

“I chose to believe there was more than grief to the ties that bound us,” Zenzele said. “That once it began to thin there would be something beneath.”

“And?”

“And I was right,” he said. “There was more to it. In some ways I regret that I will never learn who I would be away from them, Angharad, but then I suspect had I left I would we facing another set of regrets.”

He shrugged.

“Every choice carries its burdens, that is why the Sleeping God gifted us lives enough to learn from our mistakes. Paradise is earned piecemeal.”

“Redeemer talk,” she teased. “Does buying pork over beef bring you closer to eternal life as well?”

“Ugh, Universalists,” he snorted. “If my faith disqualifies, shall I find you a raised stone to ask advice from instead? I can even pretend the wind is forming words.”

“Alas, I shall have to settle for you and the ducks,” Angharad solemnly replied.

They traded grins and the conversation gave away to a comfortable silence, the ducks gorging on breadcrumbs until they tired of the meal and waddled back into the pond.

“Thank you,” she said again.

She felt him shrug at her side.

“What are friends for?” Zenzele asked.

She straightened, came to a decision.

“I would stay with the Thirty-First for a few months, at least,” she said. “Possibly the end of the year.”

“Ferranda will be pleased,” he simply replied. “You could sleep under her roof tonight, if you want to leave that awful room at the Rainsparrow behind.”

Angharad rose to her feet.

“Not tonight,” she said. “I have one last matter to deal with, I think, before I can face her and make the request.”

It was time to take up Imani Langa on that invitation to visit her. If Angharad was to break with the past, she would leave it half-done.

—

Angharad had considered the Rainsparrow Hostel a fine enough establishment, if somewhat unkempt, but she could now see why Song had been so eager to lodge at the Emerald Vaults instead: it had all the comforts of a lavish country manor. 

Most of the rooms were individual, save the suites on the third level, and after asking directions at the front Angharad found herself padding past plush carpets and elegant Cathayan paintings. Tempted as she was to slow her steps and admire the masterful ink work – only Saimha portraits were held in higher esteem, back home – she had come to the Vault for a reason.

The attendant in front had confirmed that Imani was present, so now all that was left was to finish crossing the hall to the door marked with a nine in imperial numerals. That and quietly envy how the smallest room she had seen at the Vaults was easily ten times the size of the glorified closet she currently lived in.

Angharad breathed in, tugged her coat into place – idly wishing she had polished the buttons that morning – before rapping her knuckles against the door. Once, twice, thrice. There was the sound of movement on the other side, a muffled word that might have been ‘coming’ in Antigua and after a few heartbeats the door was cracked open. Only so much, the latch still in place as dark eyes peered through the opening.

“Angharad,” Imani Langa smiled, ivory on red. “What a pleasant surprise! Allow me a moment.”

The door closed, the latch slid and this time when it opened it was all the way. Angharad stepped back and out of the way, then froze at the sight revealed. Imani was dressed for bed, in a faded red sleeveless garment whose intricate beadwork neckline dipped generously. The hem ended above her knees and it hung on Imani’s frame unbelted but given the spy’s shapeliness there was nothing loose about it.

Angharad dragged her gaze up from smooth dark thighs, ignoring the smirk on the other woman’s face.

“Do come in,” Imani said. “The hall is cold.”

Angharad chose not to consider how her underclothes must be, not to show below the night garment, however intriguing that thought. I came unannounced, the Pereduri told herself. She did not dress for seduction. Not that Imani was at all unaware of the effect the sight of her in that night dress would have, by the sway of her hips as she headed into the room. Angharad remembered to close the door after a heartbeat. The noblewoman rested her hand on her saber, gathered herself.

She had not come here to play bedroom games.

The inside was spacious, a wooden partition draped in silks dividing the bedroom from a small salon and writing desk. Imani grabbed a blanket from the green sofa, wrapping it around herself before sitting and inviting Angharad to do the same on the seat across the table. Stiffly, the noblewoman did so. It did not seem a coincidence that while Imani had artfully wrapped the blanket as to hide much of her legs, it left her generous neckline entirely on display. Enticing as the sight was, it also stirred an ember of irritation.

Did Angharad seem so empty-headed that a pretty pair and a coy smile would be enough to make a fool of her?

Her jaw locked. Such flirting felt almost like a slight, now that she put it up against the reason for her visit. Imani leaned forward, grabbing from an elegant plate a long wooden pipe and a satchel of tobacco. There was a second pipe and Imani raised a questioning eyebrow.

“I do not partake,” Angharad replied.

Father had strongly disapproved of the habit, to the extent he had weaned Mother off it before she was born.

“Back in the Isles it is now the fashion to wrap tobacco as they do in the colonies, but I prefer the Izcalli way,” Imani said as she filled the pipe. “The desert sage eases the smell.”

The spy deftly cracked a match and lit her pipe, breathing in with a pleased sigh and blowing out a small circle of smoke. Angharad wrinkled her nose – it was not so bad as the tobacco sailors liked, she would admit, but the sage only helped so much.

“I am pleased you came to visit,” Imani smiled.

It was an inviting sight, the kind inviting gallant banter, the Pereduri let it slide over her.

“You told me,” Angharad bluntly replied, “that a prisoner was taken at Llanw Hall. By whom?”

“The hired swords that burned your manor, at first,” she replied. “Though they have since been moved to the property of an induna.”

Angharad’s fists clenched, but she welcomed the anger. There was no room for distraction in her while it burned.

“What is it exactly that you offer in exchange for retrieving this ‘object’ and delivering it to you?” she asked.

Imani pulled at her pipe, blew out a long stream of pale smoke.

“The Lefthand House is not well positioned to arrange an escape,” she said. “It could, however, pass a message and provide thorough information about where that prisoner is being held.”

The spy smiled languidly.

“As a gesture of goodwill, should you swear to undertake this task for us I will reveal the identity of the prisoner.”

Angharad fought down the urge to be grateful. Giving out something you first chose to withhold was not charity, it was a trick. Knowing she was being played did not make the choice any less tempting, however.

“For all I know, they grabbed a servant and that is the nothing you dangle before me now,” she said.

She was the lady of Llanw Hall now, so securing the release of a servant would be her duty just the same, but there was duty and then there was blood.

“Would a servant be worth keeping imprisoned?” Imani asked.

The Pereduri did not answer, so eventually the spy sighed.

“The prisoner is related to you by blood,” she said. “I have nothing more to say on the matter before oaths are taken.”

Angharad’s stomach clenched. Who? She had not seen her cousins die, or Uncle Arwel for that matter. They had been in the manor when it burned, so she had long assumed, but… She breathed in, reached for calm, but like sand it kept slipping through her fingers. Because she had not seen her father die either, in truth.

He had gone to lead away their pursuers after sending her down the secret passage, but while she had heard a shot she had not seen him die. No, that is a fool’s hope, she chided herself. It must be Uncle Arwel or one of the boys.

“This object, what is it?” she asked.

“Important enough I will not name it before assurances are made,” Imani said.

Angharad’s lips thinned.

“You claim it is the High Queen’s property,” she said. “What would it be doing on Tolomontera, then? She has never laid claim to these lands.”

“I claimed it is her rightful property,” Imani corrected. “As the Watch was involved in a mishap that happened to one such artifact, it is only proper that a replacement be obtained from its holdings.”

“Clever words,” Angharad flatly said, “but they make a thin veil to drape over theft.”

The spy smiled.

“If it is any balm to your Pereduri soul, the object in question would be laid claim to by the Watch in principle but it is not in their physical possession,” she said.

To Angharad’s disgruntlement, that did help.

“And should I be caught delivering it to you,” she began.

“Death,” Imani seriously replied. “After a very unpleasant evening in the hands of the Masks, I expect.”

Angharad studied her and found no trace of a lie on that face. This was not, then, a small matter.

“There is an issue,” she said.

Imani pulled at her pipe, breathed out the smoke.

“I am all ears, Angharad.”

She struggled to find a polite way to phrase it, then gave up the struggle after a minute.

“You are of the Lefthand House,” she bluntly said. “You uphold the honor of the High Queen, not your own. How can I trust your word?”

The ufudu could lie, break the laws of hospitality and act without honor so long as such deeds were in the service of Malan. By entering the Lefthand House they became the fingers of the Queen Perpetual’s left hand, no longer individuals of their own. It was a great sacrifice, if not one Angharad could speak of with admiration.

“You cannot,” Imani Langa candidly replied. “Were my queen to demand it, I would betray you without hesitation. Instead I will say this: if Her Majesty had wanted House Tredegar unmade, she would not have sent hired swords in the night. She would have cast down your mother in open court, before the eyes of all Malan, and ordered your deaths. None would have questioned it.”

Angharad’s jaw clenched, but she did not deny the words. The High Queen had been her mother’s patron at court, and not one of the izinduna would have spoken up for Rhiannon Tredegar had her sponsor turned against her. She had remained out of factions, so while she may have lacked enemies she had lacked protectors as well.

The High Queen’s favor had been her sole lifeline.

“House Tredegar’s fall was not her doing and she was not pleased by it,” Imani said. “The accusations brought before the court forced her hand in striking your line from the rolls of nobility, but she chose not to pursue the matter any further.”

“That is no balm to me,” Angharad coldly said, “when it was I was then pursued while my kin’s murderers ran free.”

“You underestimate the worth of that restraint,” Imani replied. “House Madoc was not so subtle in smuggling you south as they – or you – believed. You would never have stepped onto that ship in Asithule had the Lefthand House not been instructed to allow it.”  

Angharad stilled. Nobles upriver from the Tredegar, the Madocs had been where her father sent her to flee – they owed him a debt, and while reluctant had discreetly taken her down the southeast roads to Asithule, near the border with the Middle Isle. She had thought their part in her escape unknown. Angharad breathed out, straightened her back.

Even if the Madocs were made to pay for their help, she was in no position to lend aid.

“Let us assume I believe the High Queen means me no ill,” Angharad said. “How am I to know that, having undertaken this task for you, you would not then hold it over my head and ask me to undertake further tasks?”

Dishonor compounded, after all. Once you had darkened a finger, the hand would always follow.

“Because I will be leaving with the object,” Imani said. “A death will be arranged for me and I will disappear. This task is the entire reason I was sent to Tolomontera.”

“And the Watch does not suspect you?” she frowned.

“No doubt I am on a list,” she shrugged. “But my name will be one of many, Angharad. Dozens of our year are spies or close enough to it there is hardly a difference – not only for the great powers, but for factions within the Watch itself. Something as momentous as the reopening of Scholomance drew many eyes from across Vesper.”

Imani light tapped the shaft of the pipe.

“Should I begin to act suspiciously I would earn greater scrutiny, but that is why we are having this conversation to begin with. You will not be watched so closely.”

Because Angharad’s connections in the Watch – her uncle, sailing for this very port – made her an unlikely suspect. The Pereduri’s fingers clenched. She let Imani pull at her pipe while she closed her eyes and thought.

She did not want to do this.

She wanted to shed all ties and complications, to make a fresh start with souls she could trust. Yet the thought of leaving her cousins behind, or her uncle… She did not know what use their jailers would have for them, but it must be vile. And the hard truth was that, when Angharad returned to take vengeance on the killer of her house, she could not afford to have the High Queen’s enmity.

Naming House Madoc and where she had taken the ship that led her out of Malan had been a warning in more ways than one. In the Kingdom of Malan, the ufudu saw much. If they were her foes, how many steps would she make it past the shore before she was grabbed?

Angharad could still remember the begging. She knew, in her mind, that it had not been real. That Scholomance had played a trick on her mind, that it had not truly been Uncle Arwel pleading a little longer, just give her a little longer. she will come for me, I know she… It had not truly been her cousins screaming, either.

But that did not mean they weren’t out there, screaming in the real world.

Did she even have a choice?

In the end, it was not that the words had truly marked her. They had not. It as how freshly they’d been said that brought them back to mind. Decide what you want, Zenzele had said, what you are willing to give for it and what steps might best deliver that end. How desperately she wanted not to do this, and… And the door of the cage was open once more, wasn’t it?

Imani claimed the High Queen wished her no ill, so why should the Lefthand House hunt her should she refuse this? Even if she learned of where her kin was held, it would be years before she could do anything about it. There was time to win the right to that information, ways to do it without bending her oaths to the Watch so much they cracked. She was not so cornered as Imani wanted her to think.

Angharad opened her eyes.

“No,” she said.

Imani studied her through her lashes, set down the pipe.

“No?”

“Did I perhaps stutter?” Angharad mildly asked.

The spy laughed.

“It is not often,” Imani said, “that people surprise me.”

“It sounds like an unpleasant way to live,” she replied.

Stiffly, she rose to her feet.

“I believe we are done here.”

The other woman idly stretched.

“You called me ufudu, a turtle, when we first met,” Imani said. “Do you know where the sobriquet comes from?”

Angharad frowned.

“The symbol of the Lefthand House is the shell of a helmet turtle,” she said. “Or so goes the story.”

It was not considered a flattering nickname because the helmeted turtle was a creature known for tucking in its head pretending it was not there when larger beasts came close. So did the Lefthand House, the joke went.

“So it is,” Imani said. “I wondered, as a girl, while the House chose such an emblem. Why not a cheetah, a caracal, or even an owl!”

“I imagine there is a reason,” Angharad politely replied.

“There is,” she said. “You see, helmeted turtles are sought out by great beasts because they will eat ticks and flies off them.”

The Pereduri blinked, waiting for something more, but that appeared to be it.

“Enlightening,” she said.

“Yes,” Imani said. “It was. Our duty is not handsome or pleasant, Angharad. We eat filth so that Malan might remain clean.”

She sighed.

“And sometimes that means doing unpleasant things to people who do not deserve them.”

She leaned forward, pulling up the plate with the pipe on it, and withdrew a small pile of papers. She laid them down facing Angharad, who glanced at them with a frown. And felt the breath steal out of her lungs as if she had been struck. The first paper was not covered by words but by a sketch. A man, tired and sallow-faced. Missing an arm.

Angharad would have recognized him even if there was but a finger left.

“My father,” she croaked out. “They have my father.”

“He has been moved to Tintavel,” Imani said.

Her head whipped back up to the spy.

“The prison-fortress,” she said. “The one that belongs to House Cadogan?”

Imani nodded. Sleeping God, what madness was this? The Cadogan were one of the most powerful houses in Peredur, the Tredegar had been so utterly beneath their attention none of them should even know the name.

“That,” Angharad began, then swallowed.

“The most impenetrable prison in all Malan,” the other woman calmly said. “And not somewhere the Watch will ever be able to help you reach. Even the Lefthand House has only been able to secure a foothold after many years and great sacrifices.”

Her fists clenched.

“You knew,” she accused. “You knew from the start there was no real choice. That I must either aid you or let my father die in a cold damp cell in fucking Tintavel.”

“I am a finger of the left hand,” Imani said. “I can be caught by surprise, Angharad.”

She smiled ruefully.

“But never unprepared.”

Angharad stared down at her, fingers clenched. She had neither drunk nor eaten inside the room. She was not, some might say, bound by guest right. But what would it really accomplish, to send her head tumbling on the carpet? The Watch would pat her on the back, but it would not force entry into the Black Mountain for such a small deed.

She could almost hear the cage’s door closing.

“I will need you to speak the words,” Imani gently said.

She breathed in. Breathed out.

“So long as the object is not a person, I swear to retrieve it for you,” Angharad forced out.

Imani did not smile in triumph, which was for the best. The noblewoman’s temper might have cut through her restraint if she had. After one last draw from the pipe, she set it down by the empty one.

“What do you know of the provenance of devils?” Imani Langa asked.

Angharad scowled.

“I was given to understand they come from the aether,” she said. “Not unlike spirits.”

“That is not untrue,” the spy noted. “Devils are an abomination under the Sleeping God because, unlike all other things, they were not crafted by His hand. They are an ancient evil from the First Empire, forced into existence by devices called Infernal Forges.”

Angharad grimaced in disgust.

“A foul thing.”

Neither Redeemers nor Universalists tolerated devils, but she had not thought the reasons given why were quite so literal.

“It is, but to keep Lucifer’s legions away from our shores it is necessary to learn what we can from such devices,” Imani said. “Such work was underway, but when the Infernal Forge in Malan’s possession was destroyed the studies stalled. It is the High Queen’s will that such an artifact be retrieved so that the work might resume.”

“I cannot imagine such a dangerous object would be under anything but heavy guard,” Angharad flatly said.

“It would be, if the Watch had it in its possession,” Imani mused. “It does not. Lucifer brought one when he made of this island his seat, you see, but when Tolomontera was invaded by the Watch it is said that the Morningstar cast it out of their reach in an act of spite. That he threw it into the aether.”

Angharad blinked.

“I cannot tread the aether,” she slowly said.

“Not the Empty Sea itself, no,” Imani agreed. “But the slaughter of that night left a mark, Angharad.”

And now it came together.

“The layer,” she said. “The Witching Hour.”

“Yes,” Imani said. “Though we cannot be sure it still dwells there. It is entirely possible that the Infernal Forge drifted into another layer over the years.”

The spy folded her hands over her knees.

“I have some further details to share with you, but only one that truly matters tonight,” Imani said.

“What now?” Angharad tiredly said. “Will you dig up the ashes of my cousin to desecrate if I displease you?”

The dark-eyed woman did not smile.

“You only have until the end of the year to get it,” Imani Langa said. “After that, our offer is withdrawn.”

# Chapter 31

Song had not thought it possible to eat an orange tauntingly before this morning, but Captain Wen Duan was expanding her horizons.

He jammed his thumb in the middle through the peel, half-ripping it open, and by the way Commander Salimata Bouare was looking at him she’d order him hung and quartered if she ever had the right. Song was not entirely sure she disagreed, considering this was the second orange Wen was subjecting to this treatment and he had gotten pulp on her covers.

Her patron sat to the left of the bed, precariously balanced on a stool requisitioned from the hospital since all the chairs had been dragged to Song’s right. He had a small bag on his folded legs, containing one last orange yet spared his torments, and a folded red handkerchief he was refraining from using in what Song could only call an act of social violence.

To her right, three sat and one stood. The Someshwari contractor by her bedside, the two scribes a little further back and the Commander Salimata leaning back against the wall with her arms folded and a steel-denting scowl. She had been in a hard mood from the moment she arrived, not that Wen’s antics were helping.

Song was surprised to realize, when hearing her speak, that the dark-skinned woman was not Malani. Given that lilting accent and the elaborate earrings marked with prayers to a patron god, she must be Jahamai – from that far eastern realm bordering Pandemonium. They were not a traveling people, making them a rare sight, but Song supposed some must join the Watch.

It was the blackcloaks that still garrisoned the fortresses around Hell’s capital, after all, their order had ties to that ancient and wealthy country.

The commander had remained largely silent during the interview, trading dark looks with a smiling Wen while the elder of the two scribes – also dark-skinned but this one definitely Malani – asked the questions and the younger wrote down the account. Now that Song had been wrung out of every detail she could remember, however, the commander had finally spoken. Song rather wished she had not, and was not alone in this.

It was almost, but not quite, deserving of the ensuing citric war crimes.

“She has been very clear,” Captain Wen said, “that she will be responding only to questions provided in advance. I don’t give a shit what they want, she’s perfectly within her rights.”

She had expected Wen to be irritated at being dragged to the hospital at the crack of morning – it was barely five – but, defying her expectations, he had been almost jaunty. Mind you, Wen’s good moods always came at the expense of someone else’s so it was no surprise he was being a stone in the senior blackcloak’s boot.

“The request was made by the patrons of those slain,” Commander Salimata acknowledged, “but it is not unreasonable.”

That lilting turn to the syllables would have made her sound pleasant even if she were ordering someone whipped to death, Song thought. Wen’s jaw clenched.

“Song Ren an enlisted officer,” he bit out. “Are you refusing to uphold her rights under the Watch charter?”

Song was almost fascinated by the sight. The tall, grim-faced commander was not the highest officer of the Tolomontera garrison. Her rank would put her at the head of a battalion, at least six hundred men, while Song figured an island of this size should be held by a regiment of at least a thousand and a half. Whoever commanded the garrison would be a colonel. A commander, though, would still be one of the three highest-ranked officers on Tolomontera.

And Wen Duan was coming after her with the verbal equivalent of a scream and a table leg.

“I have not done this,” Salimata coldly said. “I have passed along a request to your student, Duan. And it is not for you to decide in her name.”

Cool brown eyes turned to Song.

“Captain Ren?”

Song knew better than to believe an attempt to get around her patron was in any way a compliment being paid.

“I may be willing to answer the question if I am allowed to read it first,” she replied.

“That is not what was asked,” Commander Salimata sternly said.

No, it was not. They wanted it asked blind in front of a truthteller because someone thought her an utter fool.

“It is what I have to give,” Song replied.

The older woman stared her down.

“Four students are dead,” she said. “This is not a trifling matter, girl.”

“Yes,” Song agreed. “My attempted murder should be thoroughly investigated.”

Commander Salimata scoffed, then looked away. Her gaze came to rest on the younger of the two scribes.

“Give her the slip with the question on it,” the commander said. “Song Ren refused the request made by the patrons of the Thirty-Fourth and Forty-Eighth but acquiesced to the question being put forward for her consideration.”

The young Tianxi scribe nodded, cleared her throat and fumbled with her pen as she hesitated whether to first put down notes or hand over the slip. She almost tipped over her inkwell, the other scribe leaning over to catch it at the last moment, and Song felt a twinge of pity at how arctic Commander Salimata’s stare turned at the sight.

Eventually she was handed the folded paper, which bore a question about as loaded as Song had been expecting: were you the first to use lethal force? Wen cleared his throat, so she bent back and showed him the contents. The resulting laugh was unkind.

“You have a reputation as fair woman, commander,” he said. “This is disappointing.”

Commander Salimata was unmoved.

“It is information that would relevant when passing judgment,” she replied. “That the question was asked in an attempt to sully Captain Ren’s reputation is irrelevant.”

Song’s haw clenched. It was not irrelevant to her.

“If it’s asked by a truthteller during an official investigation, it’s on her record for the rest of her career,” Wen flatly said. “Most officers won’t care even if she was cleared of all faults.”

Her eyes whipped back to the large man and Song’s throat caught. She had not, in fact, known that. Meaning Wen had just saved her from a permanent stain on her record. It was a disconcerting thing to feel genuine gratitude towards the man.

“I was not appointed to manage reputations,” Commander Salimata replied. “I was appointed to find out the truth. Captain Ren, the question?”

“I decline answering it,” Song replied with forced calm.

“Mark that down, girl,” the commander said, glancing at the younger scribe. “We proceed with the agreed-on questions, then. Lieutenant Kumar, if you would?”

Lieutenant Kumar Dalal – she’d learned the surname by looking at his contract – was a short and acne-ridden Someshwari. Nodding at the implied order, he began to explain the broadest lines of this truth-telling contract. Song had already read through it while they set up, but it would have been impolitic to say so.

The concepts were not too difficult to grasp. Lieutenant Kumar, after touching someone, could make ‘wagers’ about them for the following nine minutes. If he won the wager with his god, he received an infusion of ‘life’ – vitality, Song thought, though the exact meaning of that was unclear. If he lost the wager, his god broke one of his fingers.

It was one of those fond of slapstick humor.

Lieutenant Kumar touched her wrist after asking permission, then explained that he would be making the same wager every time: that Song would not knowingly lie when answering the next question she was asked. Given that he then raised his left hand upright, the results would be obvious and immediate if she did. To Song’s eyes a ghostly red hand formed around the lieutenant’s, two translucent fingers delicately seizing Kumar’s forefinger.

The lieutenant read off the four names of her attackers.

“Were you ambushed by the students I just named?” he asked.

“Yes,” Song replied.

Eyes went to his raised hand, which did not display a snapped finger. The older scribe’s pen scratched against paper.

“Did you have reasonable cause to believe them intent on killing you?”

“Renshu expressed his intention to kill me and none of the others contradicted him,” Song replied.

No finger snapped. Furious writing.

“How many of the four did you kill?”

“Only one,” she replied. “Liu.”

“How did the others die?”

There was the question she’d had changed. The original phrasing had been ‘what killed the others’, but without knowing the nature of the contract she was going to be subjected to there had been no way to tell if she would be forced to out Maryam’s connection to the entity. She had argued that her lack of knowledge about the involved entity might force her to lie by accident, which had Commander Salimata agreeing to a change.

“They were attacked by an entity that slew them through the use of Gloam,” Song carefully replied.

And now the last question.

“Have you had contact with this entity before?”

“Not knowingly.”

And that was the end of that. Lieutenant Kumar exhaled, his acne now much sparser, and the ghostly red hand that had been holding one of his fingers faded. He was no longer using his contract. He was dismissed by the commander and left after a polite nod. Commander Salimata checked over the work of the scribes, then nodded in satisfaction.

“As I have no reason to believe Song Ren is a danger to other students, I formally revoke the house arrest she has been under,” the dark-skinned woman said.

Good, she would be able to attend class. And handle the more important conversation awaiting her afterwards. As soon as the revocation was written down, the scribes were dismissed to join Lieutenant Kumar.

“My thanks,” Song said.

“None are necessary,” Commander Salimata replied. “You are hiding something, but it is clear you truly were attacked by the missing students and survived by chance.”

She paused.

“We cannot retrieve the bodies, so it is unlikely there is more firsthand evidence to be gathered,” she said. “I will conduct interviews with the implicated patrons and cabals this afternoon, but I expect that the case will be ready for the tribunal by the end of the day. Fifthday morning at the latest.”

Probably tomorrow, then. In her experience the Watch bureaucracy rarely moved any faster than it was made to move.

“Should I be determined to be without fault,” Song said, “what can I expect?”

“The brigades involved will be dissolved, the patrons reassigned away from Tolomontera and the cabal captains referred to their covenant for any further discipline,” the commander replied. “A mark will be added to their dossier regarding the matter and taken into consideration should there be any further altercation with you.”

Well, that should settle any thought of taking revenge on her for the inconvenience. Maryam had read this right, which was some comfort. Yet the absence of one name mentioned had her stomach clenching.

“And Professor Kang?” she asked.

“As an enlisted officer, Yun Kang used his right to decline being asked questions under truthteller,” Commander Salimata replied. “He denies any involvement. As there is no direct evidence of his involvement save a secondhand report, there will be a note made on his dossier but no further discipline.”

It was an effort to keep her face calm.

“None at all?” she forced out.

Commander Salimata frowned at her, then glanced at Wen. He mutilated the last orange in response, and when the gaze returned to Song it had inexplicably thawed.

“Yun Kang was assaulted at his residence this afternoon,” the commander informed her. “He was savagely beaten and right his leg broken in nine different places.”

The gaze cooled again as it was turned on Wen.

“He even has to be treated in the barracks, given the risks, since the primary suspect for this assault cannot legally be barred from having access to this room,” she said.

Song paused, then slowly turned towards her patron. The bespectacled man popped a slice of orange into his mouth, loudly chewing before he swallowed even more loudly. Had he truly assaulted another blackcloaks on her behalf? Gods, she was… it was not a fine thing to attack someone else wearing the black, obviously, and quite illegal. Yet.

“It is insulting I would be considering a suspect at all,” Captain Wen replied without batting an eye. “I was having coffee while it happened, as you know. There are three witnesses.”

“Yes, I am well aware,” Commander Salimata bit out. “The girl from Tariac, your old friend from history track and a devil. Do you take me for a fool, Duan? A beating might have been overlooked as a settling of accounts between officers, but you took a smithing hammer to his leg.”

“Spurious accusations,” Wen affably replied. “But I imagine whoever did it figured there was poetry to Yun Kang having an aching reminder of the need to watch his step for every step of the remainder of his misbegotten fucking life.”

Song let a noise of surprise, almost squirming when the commander’s furious gaze was turned on her.

“I do not understand. Can Professor Kang not seek Lady Knit’s services?” she hesitantly asked.

“It’s been over a day,” the dark-skinned officer sighed. “She will count every break as a different fix. The price for so many boons would be…”

“Ruinous,” Captain Wen grinned, biting into a slice of orange with relish.

Commander Salimata visibly reined herself in.

“You walked a fine line, Duan,” she bit out. “You often do. Best hope you never trip, or the next hole you will be buried in will make the Dominion look like a paradise.”

He shrugged.

“It’s been a pleasure, Salimata, but I believe we’re done here.”

“For now,” she said, then turned her gaze to Song. “A good day to you, Captain Ren. It is unlikely we will meet again, so I wish you fruitful years in the Watch.”

“And you,” Song replied.

The silence she left behind her was heavy. Song cleared her throat.

“If I were to ask you what happened in Tariac,” she leadingly said.

“I’d be forced to tell you to mind your own business, only not as nicely,” Wen replied.

Well, she could take a hand. Especially if it was handed to her rather insistently.

“Have you decided what you’ll do?” he conversationally asked.

“Attend class,” she said.

He actually looked amused at that.

“And then?”

She bit her lip. Song had not slept well, after Maryam’s departure, instead spending much of the night staring at the walls. But an idea had taken root, however dangerous.

“I need your help,” she said.

“Eh,” Wen said, promising nothing. “Ask, at least.”

“Do you have access to the harbor logs?” Song asked.

The large man pushed up his glasses, looking quite interested.

“Not officially,” he said. “But it can be done. Why?”

“I need you to find out something for me,” she said. “And to serve as a witness while I sign some documents.”

Wen Duan sighed.

“And this came so close to being interesting,” he mourned.

—

The garlic rice wasn’t as good as it had been last night, but after some time over the fire it was hot and fragrant.

Maryam fetched a few stripes of salted fish from the pot to prop up the breakfast, grimacing all the while. They tasted like chewy seawater leather, though given how ridiculously cheap saltfish was she knew she would have to get used it. It was hard to argue with meat that could be had for coppers and would last until the Time of Fraying so long as you kept it cool and dry.

“If you keep glaring at it, it’ll flee back into the sea,” Tristan drily said.

The glare moved up from the fish to the rat.

“I’ll not suffer backtalk from a man who asked if we have vinegar to dip that in,” Maryam said, jabbing an accusing finger.

His grin only got wider.

“What did you even eat for meat, if you couldn’t stomach fish?”

“Goat, mostly,” she said. “Pork or beef when it was slaughter season.”

She took a bite of the rice, swallowed.

“It’s the fruits I miss the most,” she admitted. “Volcesta is at the top of a valley full of orchards, the streets were thick with hawkers’ carts every morning. You could get a whole bushel for city-coins.”

He cocked his heat to the side.

“City-coins?” he asked.

She ate another mouthful of rice.

“Most kings made their own currency,” Maryam told him, “but many were trash so the coinage was only used within their own city.”

The hills around Volcesta bore iron and copper but nothing else, so the Khaimov had been some of the worst offenders among the Izvoric. Traders often refused to take Volcesta coin at all unless it was knife-money, copper shaped into a dull knife. Mother had often made sport of Father for never using his own currency if he could avoid it.

“Thus, city-coins,” he said. “As opposed to…”

“Trader-coins,” she replied. “Those had weight, size and make set by law. It was a drowning crime to pass false ones, or reason for war if done by a king’s hand.”

“It seems madness for no one to own that,” he mused. “Sacromonte fought a dozen wars to ensure the only coinage stamped in the Trebian Sea is its own. Even the mints abroad are run by the House of Fabres.”

Maryam had heard about that. Captain Totec had more than once groused about ‘Sacromontan robbery’ and how it was a self-inflicted wound by the Watch.

“The Treaty of Blancaflor, yes?”

The great bargain that had ended the myriad small wars Sacromonte had fought against the Watch when it first began to expand through the Trebian Sea. He nodded.

“It’s half the reason any island out there still listens to the Six,” he said. “Everyone knows the City’s only got the largest fleet of the Trebian Sea on paper.”

From what little Maryam knew of the treaty, it had been considered a coup by both sides – though Sacromonte’s influence had waned over the centuries, and the granted rights that had once been a jewel on its crown were now as a drowning man’s driftwood instead. The blue-eyed woman polished off the last of the rice, leaving only two stripes of salted fish on the side of plate.

She’d get around to them eventually.

“Is there truly nothing you miss from Sacromonte?” Maryam asked. “You rarely speak of it fondly.”

“Because it’s a shithole,” he bluntly replied. “I regret some of the food, but I’ll learn to make it myself. I don’t intend to ever return there save to settle private affairs.”

“I find that difficult to understand,” she admitted.

“The evil you’ve known, it was imported,” Tristan shrugged. “Mine was born and bred just across town.”

He was finished with his plate, fish and all, and rose to put it away. She sipped at her water, delaying the inevitable.

“Are we to meet Song anywhere in particular?” he asked from the kitchen.

“Directly in Theology,” she replied. “She did not know how long the interrogation would take, so she said we should meet her there instead.”

“Hopefully she’ll not kill another four students on the way,” Tristan drawled. “I expect they’ll be less forgiving the second time.”

It was a tasteless jest but not one meant to prick – and yet Maryam found herself grimacing. Because it hadn’t been Song who killed most of her ambushers, was it? It had been some thing calling herself the Keeper of Hooks, like there was anyone alive still deserving of the title. Like Maryam’s own soul had not been a funeral pyre for centuries of Craft-lore.

Only Song had said she saw a soul inside, so what if the thing was not a thing at all? Her heart clenched.

“It was not such a barb as to warrant that face, surely,” Tristan said.

His face was still smiling, but those gray eyes had cooled.

“It isn’t about Song,” Maryam said, hand reaching for her wooden fingers. “There’s been…”

She sighed.

“We can talk about it properly some other time,” Maryam said. “I would get answers from Captain Yue first.”

He watched her silently for a moment, then nodded.

“As you say.”

He sounded not resigned, she thought, but… unsurprised? As if it were only to be expected, and that was what did it most of all. That fraying rope becoming ever more frayed, until one day she’d pull at it and find there was nothing at all. Maryam set down her cup.

“We didn’t talk last night,” she said.

An eyebrow raised.

“We did little else,” Tristan replied.

“We talked about Song, and plans,” Maryam corrected. “We didn’t talk.”

That gave him pause, she saw. He flicked a glance to his right, irritation flickering across his face.

“Your goddess?” she asked.

“I thought I heard a fly buzzing,” he airily replied.

Maryam would not have believed him even if he’d not then immediately tensed like he was refraining from shielding his head being slapped at.

“Fine,” he said, clearing his throat. “Please, continue.”

“I’m not sure I am the one who should be talking,” she honestly said. “You are the one angry with me.”

He looked surprised, as if he’d not been walking around with that chip on his shoulder since yesterday. She almost sighed.

“You came yesterday with your fists up, ready for a brawl,” she told him.

“Because I knew we would-”

“This has nothing to do with Song,” she flatly said, “and you’ll not be getting out of this conversation by bringing her into it.”

A beat passed. He smiled, prepared to put on the charm, and Maryam felt like punching him in the face. She would not, but thankfully there was an alternative.

“O great goddess,” she called out to the air. “Maryam Khaimov promises you a fitting boon should you knock that false smile right off his face.”

His eyes widened before he suddenly blanked his expression.

“Like that would-” he began then flinched, turned to his left with a glare, “-ouch, pinching, really? Are you a child?”

“Thank you, o great one,” Maryam solemnly said.

“She’s just flattering you, you vain idiota,” he complained, swatting at the air. “Just leave, would you? We’re having a conversation.”

After a heartbeat he let out a sigh, putting his elbows on the table, then gray eyes turned on her.

“That was uncalled for,” he said.

“So was preparing to give me the Ferrando Villazar grin,” she flatly replied. “Is it really too much to ask that you do not flee this conversation?”

His jaw clenched.

“That is rich, coming from you,” Tristan bit back.

She could see the moment where he realized what he had said, the way he forced his gaze not to dip down towards her hand, and knew in a heartbeat what it was about. The fingers, of course. For all that he made fun of Tredegar’s precious honor, he was no less particular about debt than the Pereduri.

“I will be more insulted,” Maryam said, “if you say nothing.”

His entire face clenched, like he was preparing to take a punch on the jaw.

“It is not fair, or true,” he said. “And so not worth mentioning.”

“Do it anyway,” Maryam said, and it was not a request.

Gray eyes met her blue. Silence stretched out like a rope pulling taut until Maryam began to open her mouth – only to be cut off at the last moment.

“You dragged me into this brigade,” Tristan bit out, “and then left me in it the moment things went south.”

“Because I left that night,” she quietly said.

He grit his teeth.

“Because you left that night,” he agreed, almost conceded. “But that is just the shark’s fin. I don’t need you to hold my hand, Maryam, but I expected us to at least be in the same fucking boat. Only whenever there’s knives out in the Thirteenth, you walk.”

“I only left-”

“You walk out in your head,” he cut through. “Bite the anger and stop listening, stop talking. You get angry with Song, you chew it. You get angry with Tredegar, you chew it – maybe spit out a few fishbones her way. There’s only so many times I’m willing to ease the blades for a cabal I only joined for you in the first place. If you don’t care, why in the Manes should I?”

Maryam opened her mouth to argue the point, to make him see, but she made herself close it. She was not like Tristan or Song, who could walk into a room full of strangers and within an hour find the levers to pull on half of them. She did not have the eyes for that, the talent. But she thought that, sometimes, that same knack turned around on them. They so often thought of conversation as a test, something you won or lost.

It was not, so instead of arguing Maryam listened. Made herself see it. The two of them had been a pair, on the Dominion. The same side, and though they had kept their own secrets they had moved in the same direction. Not so on Tolomontera, Maryam must admit. She had been lost, and whenever she had not been furious with Song helping her had been her compass’ north.

He was not wrong, to feel left behind.

“I’m sorry,” she said.

It had some part of her aching, the genuine surprise on his face.

“I’ve been,” she began, then hesitated. “My Signs failing, it has weighed on me. It could see me thrown out of Scholomance, and it seemed like there was no fix. But helping Song, it felt like blackcloak work. Steadying the cabal, being a good watchwoman.”

She sighed.

“I think I’ve found a way, for my Signs,” Maryam said. “I don’t need…”

To be what holds Song up, to be the useful one, she did not say. I don’t need it as much.

“I have my own way,” she finally said. “It won’t happen again.”

He slowly nodded, face inscrutable. Did he believe her, did he understand? She could not tell and it felt tiring, all of sudden, to always wonder. And maybe she had been sitting on some unfair words as well.

“I admire it, you know,” Maryam said. “How when everything falls apart, you keep a cool head. See only what you need to and go for the throat.”

An eyebrow cocked.

“But,” Tristan said.

Her fist clenched, wooden joints creaking.

“You need to be able to put it down, Tristan,” Maryam quietly said. “When you come home, at least. You can’t always be on war footing, like a single toe across the line means the knives are out. It’s exhausting.”

He stayed silent. Licked his lips.

“I don’t mean to,” he finally said.

“I know,” she replied. “But you don’t fight it, either. And I know why you do it, that it served you, but-”

“It is exhausting,” he murmured.

“When you manage me, you don’t,” Maryam said. “I can tell, Tristan. It just means I have to go digging to get what you truly think, and it can be amusing but more often it is a chore.”

A half-hidden wince, like he’d gone to smooth it away before realizing what he was doing and stopping.

“I’d rather have the ugly parts, if it means you being honest,” she said.

A slow nod.

“That is,” he began, then bit the inside of his cheek. “Not what I was taught. Or how I am.”

His eyes dipped low.

“I can try,” he said. “But I do not think you truly understand what is expected of a Mask.”

“Then tell me,” she gently said.

He looked away.

“I’ll think on it,” he said. “I – some of my teachers speak differently than others.”

Maryam breathed out.

“It’s all I ask,” she said.

Her hands, she realized, were trembling. Sometimes you only realized how much you would miss something when it began to slip through your fingers.

She was glad to have caught it early enough.

“So much talking, these days,” Maryam weakly jested.

He smiled back just as weakly.

“Still beats the Terror Hole,” Tristan said.

They looked at each other for a moment, then a chuckle ripped free of her. It bubbled up into laughter, the gray-eyed thief matching. It hadn’t been all that funny, but the release felt good. Like purging a fever. Maryam asked for the time, after the last of the laughter died, and found they were nearly late.

How unfortunate, she did not have time to finish her plate. The fish would have to wait.

“Fortuna is calling in her boon.”

Her eyes swiveled the thief’s way, finding him leaning against the kitchen counter with a smirk.

“Already?” she asked. “I am all ears.”

He cocked his head to the side, as if listening, then nodded.

“All the fish on your plate,” he said. “Cram it into your mouth and swallow.”

Maryam cleared her throat.

“O great one,” she tried, “surely-”

“Quibble and I’m to get one more stripe from the pot.”

The Izvorica grimaced, looking down at her plate.

“It figures you’d contract with an evil god,” she muttered, and reached down.

Let it not be said that Maryam Khaimov did not do her duty. Her hateful, hateful duty.

—

Given that he was to sit with Song Ren again, it felt appropriate for the Theology class to be largely about contracts.

It was a gripping enough subject that even the touchy Professor Artigas found nothing to scowl at as she began her lecture, some students even leaning in. She first outlined the elementary terms, first what qualified as a god and then as a contract – for the latter, ‘any power leant by a god with a fixed price and duration’. Tristan found himself wondering how she would classify contracts at large – the nature of the effects perhaps, or of the gods? – and would admit surprise at the answer.

“Price,” the blonde wrote on the slate. “Given the near endless diversity of gods and boons, the only functional way to classify contracts is by price.”

Intrigued murmurs, followed by that impeccably styled hair bobbing as the Navigator traced a Sign and glued the loudest offender’s hands over his mouth. That put an end to it right quick.

“The simplest manner of contract is the ‘boon contract’,” she said, writing out the two words. “The god will lend the contractor an ability in exchange for an oath to enact a specific deed for them – the eponymous boon – usually on a fixed timescale. Once that deed is enacted the ability will often, if not always, be rescinded.”

She hummed.

“Boon contracts are most common with the weakest and most powerful of gods, that is to say aetheric intellects that are too thin to maintain several more complicated contracts or ingrained enough they can shrug off the risks of a bad investment.”

The professor underlined ‘boon contracts’, then lowered the chalk.

“’Exchange contracts’, sometimes called ‘scales contracts’, are the most common contracts on Vesper,” Professor Artigas said. “By our count, somewhere in the vicinity of seven in ten are of this kind. The underlying principle is straightforward: the contractor is granted by the god access to an ability, but every time it is used a price must be paid.”

She snorted.

“Gods prefer such arrangements largely for the same reason the wealthy enjoy becoming landlords,” the professor drawled. “A proportionally small investment may yield great dividends over time. As few gods will prevent their contractor from pulling overmuch, most cases of sainthood spawn from exchange contracts.”

Tristan cocked his head to the side. So he was bound to Fortuna by an ‘exchange contract’, in the eyes of the Watch.  Another slash of chalk followed by words.

“Legacy contracts,” Professor Artigas announced. “By far the rarest. The only people able to reliably secure them are Izcalli royals, Circle priests from select reincarnation sects and Sacromonte’s own House of Arquer. Legacy contracts are unique in that the god contracts not with an individual but a bloodline.”

She shrugged.

“All contract lore is kept secret, understandably, but what surrounds legacy contracts in particular,” she said. “I can tell you that the price is fixed in advance and identical for every signatory onto such a contract, and that direct descent from the original contractor is almost always a requirement. As a rule, such contracts are often among the most ‘powerful’ in a direct sense but they often carry debilitating costs.”

One more slash.

“Caprice contracts,” she said. “Only less rare than the legacies because they cover a wide range of what we can only call oddities. Some gods were formed or subsist from concepts that do not easily lend themselves to prices – either by boon or exchange. We call these ‘caprice contracts’ because the god may demand a seemingly insignificant price, which simply happens to lead their contractor in situations that serve as prayer to them.”

She paused.

“A god that feeds on brawling, for example, might require habitual insolence of their contractor,” Professor Artigas said. “We will delve into more elaborate, and arguably insidious, examples of this later.”

There was no need of further Signs to keep the class spellbound, and the three hours were gone in the blink of an eye. Tristan had never taken so many notes in his life, but the subject warranted it. Few men were more dangerous than contractors, out in the world.

The thief watched Tredegar, who had sat with the Thirty-First and nodded a goodbye only to him out of the remains of the Thirteenth – returned in kind – bustle off with Ferranda’s lot. She really had changed ship, hadn’t she? Good on her. She seemed happier for it, and he was happier not wondering if he was ever going to cross some line of honor that’d require her stabbing him. Everybody won.

Except Song, and that was no tragedy.

Arrangements for the conversation he was not looking forward to were made quite easily.

“I need to pick up something in the Triangle,” Song told him. “If you know of an agreeable place to eat, we can meet there and I will invite you.”

Tristan quirked an eyebrow.

“Not Maryam?”

The Tianxi shook her head.

“It would defeat the point of the conversation to have it with a mediator,” she said.

The conversation had no point, he thought, but it was not worth the argument to say as much. He agreed and revealed the location of the paella place, getting a happy smile from Maryam. It would not last, so he did not let himself enjoy it.

An hour and a half later, he was sitting in the nook with his back to the wall while Song polished off the last of her paella. She’d seemed to enjoy it, to his mild surprise, though she admitted to preferring the spices of Tianxia to the palette of Liergan. The thief had half-heartedly tried to open the conversation when the plates were served only to get a dry look for it.

“You should get to enjoy the meal, at least,” Song had said.

Now that it was over, however, it was time to pay his dues. To his surprise, she suggested they stroll closer to the docks first. Eventually they found a bench in the shadows, overlooking the stone piers and the six ships docked. Most of them were empty, though the largest carrack had some blackcloaks on the deck and the caravel at the left end had someone in the crown’s nest. He settled as comfortably as he could, leaving a solid foot of space between them on the bench.

“I apologize,” Song Ren suddenly said.

He side-eyed her.

“For?”

“Blaming you, that night,” she said. “For a great many things, but none more than what we did to the traitor. I was as much part of that decision as you.”

Tristan grunted in acknowledgement. An apology was not nothing, only nothing much.

“Maryam tells me you want to leave the Thirteenth,” she said.

He shrugged.

“Better for all of us, I think,” Tristan replied. “Though I’ll at least stay on until next month, like she asked.”

“I’ll not make trouble for you if you want to transfer,” Song said. “I have been considering, however, how to convince you to stay on.”

A dose of bluntness, he thought, might save them a frustrating hour of going around in circles.

“There isn’t a way,” he said. “I am sitting here mostly as a courtesy to Maryam.”

“It would not be convincing if you wanted to be convinced,” Song ruefully replied. “But I expect I may need some more time, for that, so to buy my way to that conversation I have been giving thought to your situation.”

He frowned at her.

“Only even if I killed the entire Forty-Ninth overnight,” Song Ren calmly said, “it would not be the end of your troubles, really. A temporary solution at best.”

Tristan stilled, watching her face, and found no trace of a lie there. She had seriously considered it. It began to dawn on him he had walked into a very different conversation from the one he was expecting.

“The bounty’s the real problem,” the thief cautiously agreed. “But I know of no way to have it pulled.”

“There isn’t,” she agreed. “Whoever it was that put it up, they have enough influence within the Watch they cannot easily be forced away. Yet there is, fundamentally, a constraint on the collection of the bounty.”

She leaned back, pulled her coat closer.

“To get you off Tolomontera, they need a ship,” Song said.

He hummed. It was an obvious enough thing, but with the two of them sitting in the afternoon breeze looking at the docks the Tianxi’s implications were made just as plain. The Ivory Library had no way to know when the brigades they had contacted on the island might grab him – which meant either they had a place to stash him as a prisoner or the ship he was meant to be stolen away on must remain in the harbor.

“You think you found out which one,” Tristan guessed.

“That small caravel at the east end of the docks,” Song said. “It’s called the Palmyran and it is not a Watch ship, strictly speaking. It is contracted and owned by the Peiling Society but does not fly the black.”

He frowned.

“And they let it dock at Port Allazei anyway?”

“Someone pulled strings,” she said. “On record, they are bringing restricted supplies for Scholomance. They were also meant to be gone a week ago but the garrison is choosing not to pursue the matter.”

“Someone got bribed,” Tristan flatly said.

“I expect not,” Song replied. “Being caught endangering the isolation of Scholomance would be a career-ender. Given that ships on contract for the Watch have some right to use Watch ports when necessary, I might simply be enough of a headache to evict the Palmyran that the garrison prefers waiting it out.”

A pause.

“They must not seem much of a threat, as the crew numbers only twelve and none save the captain – a retired watchwoman – are allowed to leave the docks,” she said.

He let out a low whistle.

“That’s a small crew, even for a caravel,” Tristan said. “All it takes is one bad storm away from port and they’ll be in real trouble.”

“A larger ship would have seen the College accused of trying to get private troops inside Port Allazei,” Song informed him. “The influence of your enemies has limits, clearly.”

“Always good news,” Tristan drily replied.

She was doing him a good turn, sharing that, and it should not go unacknowledged.

“Thank you for the information,” he added. “I’ll keep an ear out for anything that might be of use to you.”

“I have been giving thought to your situation,” Song repeated.

The conversation did not feel like it was ended, at least on her end, so he remained seated even as silence wafted on the breeze.

“I would clear them out entirely,” she abruptly said. “The Palmyran, the Forty-Ninth. End them in one stroke.”

“The catch being?”

“The means I have in mind would require a great deal of trust from you,” Song said. “And at the moment I expect you trust me about as much as you do Tupoc.”

Tristan cleared his throat.

“You still beat out Tupoc,” he assured her.

But then so had Boria, the maneating god inside that pillar back on the Dominion, so the true worth of that achievement was debatable. In Tristan’s defense, the ancient abomination had been quite personable if you tuned out the leg-chewing noises.

“As sound an endorsement of my performance as captain as I have warranted,” Song ruefully replied.

His brow rose. Tristan did not move to defend her, wondering if that had been the ploy, but her look was not expectant.

“So, as the intermediary step, I considered what might make you extend me some measure of trust,” she continued, looking out at the water.

He glanced at her, gauged her mood and decided on another sliver of honesty.

“I’m not sure why you would bother,” he frankly said. “We dislike each other and Maryam will stick with you when I leave.”

A bitter pill to swallow, but swallow it he had. To his surprise, the Tianxi chuckled.

“I have wondered that as well,” Song admitted. “If it was not childish of me to cling to the Thirteenth as it first came to these shores instead of letting events take their course and building one without so many…”

“Cracks in the foundation,” he suggested.

“So to speak,” she agreed.

“And?”

“And it smacked of vanity, wanting to convince you to stay,” Song admitted. “So I went over whom I might replace you with.”

“There’ll be plenty of takers in the coming weeks,” Tristan predicted. “Once a few brigades bit it, there will be floaters to pick from by the dozen.”

“I am not unaware,” she said, then breathed in. “But if I wanted to pick from the bottom rung, I would never have gone with Maryam to the Dominion. I am a Stripe recommended, Tristan – that I can fill out a cabal is not in doubt, only the quality of those I can fill it out with. We set out to look for diamonds in the rough.”

“Not a lot of spare Tredegars lying around,” he said.

“Not only her,” Song Ren said.

He cocked an eyebrow. It was a little late for flattery.

“Wen called you one of the most talented on the year’s roster,” she said, “but I did not truly agree until I had to think who to replace you with.”

She snorted.

“Since coming to Port Allazei I have met students with underhand skills, students with an eye for tactics and capable of diplomacy,” Song said. “Some even have two.”

A steady look.

“Only one with three,” she said. “I will not pretend there are not those whose skills I hold in higher esteem, but in the end it is telling I would need two replacements to fill the hole you leave.”

Tristan matched her gaze, gray against silver.

“Is this where I blubber out thanks for a half-baked compliment and swear eternal servitude?” he mildly said. “I appreciate the flowers, Song, but they change nothing.”

“I don’t expect them to,” she said. “I am acknowledging a fault, Tristan. I believed I knew what the brigade I wanted to lead should be like, and treated any deviation from that as a flaw. I should have learned to lead the Thirteenth that existed instead of the one I desired.”

He hummed.

“May that insight serve you well in the days to come,” he said.

She seemed amused.

“It is almost refreshing to be disliked so openly,” she said. “Both Tianxi and Stripes prefer such things buried.”

“You’re not the worst person I know,” he admitted. “But you are not someone I want to take orders from.”

“I expect not,” she acknowledged. “But what you do want is to get rid of the troubles dogging your step, so I prepared this for you.”

She straightened and reached inside her coat, taking up a sheath of folded papers. Quirking a brow, he took them when offered. Three copies of the same thing, he saw, then read through.

‘To see the truth of things’, followed by a list of what that meant. Gods, illusions, through Gloam and Glare and even natural darkness. Seeing at a distance and the ability to read contracts as golden letters in the appropriate language. ‘Luren’, a minor god whose origins were unknown. Then- gray eyes rose.

“Was is this? Tristan asked.

“The exact terms of my contract, as far as I know them,” Song said. “Signed and attested by my patron, Captain Wen Duan. It is a formal document, usable before a tribunal.”

Tristan blinked and looked down, certain he must have missed something. There was only one sentence for the price.

“You don’t know,” he slowly said. “You don’t know what your own damn price is?”

She had the decency to look embarrassed.

“I did not set one when I took Luren’s contract,” Song said.

“You must have set a boundary, at least,” he insisted.

“Take anything you want,” she softly quoted.

He choked.

“How are you not a Saint?”

Even as a desperate, bleeding child minutes away from dying he’d bargained terms with Fortuna’s voice. The luck he needed to survive the day, and she had demanded misfortune in equal part for it. And now he was being told that Song fucking Ren had just handed some shady Tianxi god a blank slate to write his price on?

“I have only speculation,” Song stiffly replied. “Either the price is already paid but unnoticeable, or it is to be a single act yet to be requested.”

And part of him was fascinated by that, by the implications, but the mindful part kept walking down the street. Such a document, if distributed, could finish sinking her reputation. Song already had a target on her back because of her surname, if she was also known to be able to read everyone’s contracts any contractor with something to hide would want her dead. And any brigade tempted to take her in anyhow because of how very useful her contract was would hesitate if her price was revealed as, well, ‘take anything’. Her god could ruin her in an instant, should he feel like it.

Tristan lined up the bits of information, considered them. Placed them on the balance to weigh against the risks.

“It could kill your career,” he finally acknowledged, “but it would not kill you. It is leverage, not a knife at your throat.”

“I thought you might say that,” Song acknowledged.

She reached inside her coat again, handing him a second folded paper. Antigua again, this one a… confession, more or less. An introduction, then the meat of it.

‘I have entreated Tristan Abrascal to take part in an operation against his would-be abductors on the Palmyran and their helpers in the Forty-Ninth Brigade, to take place on the coming thirdday. This will put him at their mercy on my behalf. If he is not then rescued from their custody, the reason is my betrayal. I will have gone against my word, committed trafficking of Watch personnel and broken my charge of care and protection as captain of the Thirteenth Brigade. This I confess, and let it be considered admission before any tribunal of the Watch.’

Signed, again witnessed by Captain Wen Duan. Like with the last paper, she handed him two copies.

“If this is not enough to arrange for my death in response to betrayal, I would be surprised and disappointed,” Song said.

Idly Tristan considered that the greatest spread of damage would be leaving one letter with Zenzele, with instructions to hand it to Angharad Tredegar should he disappear, then arrange for the second to be sent to the offices near the docks. Whether she got honor-stabbed or hanged was the only bet left after that. There was one detail that could unravel it, though.

“How do I know this is truly Wen’s signature?” he asked,

“Ask him,” she shrugged. “You have time to make certain.”

Tristan hummed. Did Wen dislike him enough to leave him out to dry if he was abducted? Maybe. But the man was also a Watch loyalist to the bone and would not countenance a Scholomance student being grabbed off the street no matter who it was. Assuming Song was aiming to betray him he must also assume Maryam would be silenced somehow, so she could not be counted on, but overall the balance of events was still…

In his favor. And getting rid of his hunters would make it much easier to find another brigade.

“All right, Song,” Tristan said, eyes moving to the sleek silhouette of the Palmyran. “What’s your plan?”

# Chapter 32

Tonight was the night.

Song rose early and made breakfast: eggs, bread, bacon rashers. Not at all a meal she enjoyed, but it was hearty fare and the others seemed inordinately fond of it. Tristan stumbled in a few minutes later, his hair in no way distinguishable from usual even though he had clearly just got out of bed.

“Fancy,” he said after a peek at the pan, sliding into a seat at the kitchen table.

“The eggs only had a day left,” she replied.

He took his eggs scrambled, mixed with onions and tomatoes if there were any to spare. There were just enough of the latter left from the potage that sprucing up his eggs did not feel like a waste, so into the pan they went. He waited until the bacon was added to his plate before thanking her, cutting his own slice from the loaf. Just a little diagonally, to the left of straight. Ugh.

She tried not to visibly react, but he was suddenly all smiles. The little bastard had definitely noticed.

Maryam only emerged when they were both done with their plates, dressed for the day and freshly washed. Song heated her rashers again and made her eggs cooked on both sides, which went to show that bad taste could cross the ocean. It was one of these historical tragedies that outside Tianxia only the Someshwari seemed to understand eggs were best eaten as omelets.

“Ooh, you even put in the herbs,” Maryam enthused.

With her mouth full, which rather evened out the expression of appreciation in Song’s book.

“I’ll leave the dishes to you two,” she said, getting up. “I need to get ready for the day.”

She paused and carefully did not look at the man in question.

“Will you be needing the washbasin, Tristan?”

A pause, long and thoughtful.

“Did you cook the breakfast we like just to be sure I’d feel guilty enough to agree?” the thief asked.

“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Song Ren lied. “I’ll leave a clean cloth for you. And a comb.”

“The things a man does for bacon,” Tristan gravely said.

“You can’t cross her, she’s the only one who can make it crunchy but still bendy,” Maryam whispered.

Confident in her victory, Song retreated upstairs as they began bickering over how Tristan overcooked his and she ‘slurped up raw pig entrails’. Uncle Zhuge had never mentioned the importance of maintaining cooking superiority when preparing her for captaincy, which was sane and reasonable but still somehow felt like an oversight on his part.

The Tianxi fetched the clothes she had laid out, closed the door to the washing room and shed her night clothes before scrubbing herself thoroughly with cloth and soap. She rinsed and wiped before checking on her braid in the copper mirror, finding it a little loose. She pulled it up and combed her hair freshly before braiding it anew, in that easy pattern Mother had taught her as a girl.

When she was finished she put on layer after layer, checking on the buttons and adjusting the collar. The combat fit for today, though her belt was downstairs with her guns and sword. Song gave herself one last once over in the looking glass, facing a neat profile with a severe edge to its cast. The impression she wanted to give, now most of all.

Her interlocutor would only see any hint of weakness as an invitation to take liberties.

Giving a satisfied nod, she changed the water of the washbasin and put away her nightclothes after folding them. She dipped back into the room to place a clean cloth folded where it could not be missed, along with a small comb and even the soap.

The latter was a long shot, but a girl could dream.

—

Tonight was the night.

Angharad had been looking forward to it ever since Lord Musa handed her the formal invitations, so she rose already in a good mood. The house was small enough the smell of breakfast spread through every nook and cranny, Angharad padding into the kitchen in her nightdress to find Rong’s usual: warm rice porridge, a traditional Tianxi meal. They made the same thing every morning, which she would have come to find tedious if not for the many plates of toppings spread around the porridge bowls on their cramped kitchen table.

Eggs, chopped turnips and carrots, some sort of ruddy bean paste, stripes of cooked chicken and fish, sundry spices: the porridge stayed largely the same, but could be made to taste rather differently according to what one sprinkled in.

Rong Ma was setting down the last plate when she arrived, and they nodded a greeting before sliding onto a stool. The room that was both their kitchen and their drawing room was smaller than most, a consequence of having one bedroom more than most houses on the street. It made for crowded common space but appreciable privacy when such was wished for.

“Good morning,” Angharad greeted them, claiming her own stool. “Were you out late? I didn’t even hear you come in last night.”

“Shalini tossed me out at the eleventh hour, so no,” Rong drily replied. “As if she wasn’t going to be up burning candles over those novels of hers whether I tinkered or not.”

Not for the first time, Angharad eyed the other blackcloak for any resentment at their once workshop having been turned into her bedroom only to find none. The Tianxi seemed to find it somewhat inconvenient to have to walk back and forth between the houses, but remained otherwise indifferent. It had been a relief not to end up on the wrong foot from the start.

“I think we’re not supposed to know about those,” Zenzele noted, walking into the kitchen.

He slid into the stool between them, immediately reaching for the eggs. He was an egg hog, Angharad had learned, though surprisingly light on spices. Mother would have called the way he ate hollow food.

“Are they not explorers’ journals?” she asked. “That seems an odd thing to hide.”

They were in Samratrava so the actual contents were unknown to her, but the covers sometimes had ship outlines on them.

“Something is getting explored in those books, all right,” Rong muttered, sprinkling turnip liberally.

“They are Someshwari filth about brave Ramayan merchant captains seducing pretty foreigners while becoming fabulously wealthy,” Zenzele amusedly explained. “Every other book an evil Tianxi admiral gives a monologue before losing to superior Ramayan charm and cunning.”

“The Yellow Earth tried to get them banned back in the Republic of Wendi on account of them being royalist propaganda, but they sell too well for the courts to allow it,” Rong sighed. “That’s Wendi for you – they’d sell pieces of the Circle, if the profits were good enough.”

“Tianxi are not alone in such habits. Pillow books about noble swordmistresses being captured and ravished by savage Sunflower Lords are quite popular with some circles, back in Malan,” Angharad admitted.

She then slid a slightly guilty look Zenzele’s way. Women’s talk, that, not the sort of thing one discussed around husbands. The dark-skinned man only cocked an eyebrow.

“The books for men are horrid,” he told her.

He popped an egg into his mouth, swallowed.

“Tree metaphors, Angharad,” he said, voice harrowed. “Tree metaphors as far as the eye can see.”

She choked on her mouthful of porridge, choking until Rong slapped her back. She sent them a grateful look and the meal was polished off with haste. The three were up earlier than trek to Scholomance would warrant, in part because the Tianxi tinker wanted to pick up some affairs from their workshop and Angharad had an appointment of her own. She began to bring away the dishes, as was her duty – unlike under Song, in the house tasks were split but did not rotate – but Zenzele stopped her.

“I’ve nothing but a lazy morning ahead,” he told her. “Leave me the dishes and see if you can get in early at the shop.”

“Ah, that’s right,” Rong said, turning to eye her. “Your dress for the banquet.”

“I planned my time so I could hold up my end,” Angharad insisted.

“I misplaced mine, so I need something to spend it on,” Zenzele said, shooing her off. “Away with you.”

“I cannot-”

“Tell me if Musa uses the wrong fork at any point tonight and we shall call it even,” he said.

It would have been graceless to push the matter further, so Angharad gave in. She returned to her room for a wash and a quick change. After her goodbyes, it was a matter of moments before her boots hit pavement.

—

Song had believed Tupoc Xical to be setting the time and place largely to inconvenience her, so it was a surprise to find he was actually hard at work.

Near the southern end of Regnant Avenue, just short of the barracks, were a few blocks’ worth of courtyard houses. The Lierganen equivalent, anyway, which was smaller and meant for a single branch of a family instead of the tree. The Watch had forbidden them from being used as housing so that the barracks wouldn’t be shooting at students if they had to turn their cannons north, leaving a row of surprisingly decent training spaces in the form of stone courtyards far from any lemures that no one had claim over.

And training was actually what Tupoc was using the house he’d directed her towards for.

Song stepped through the threshold to the sound of wood clattering against wood, finding a half-naked and barefoot Tupoc batting away the shaft of his cabalist’s spear. Expendable – Velaphi, that tragedy of a contract revealed his true name to be – growled and stepped in, trying to hammer into his captain’s chest with his grip. The Izcalli deftly danced around the blow, kicking him in the back of a knee and clicking his tongue as the amber-eyed man stumbled.

“Temper,” Tupoc chided. “Either fight with the beast or fight with your head: the middle ground is the worst of both worlds, and the gods know your best is still so terribly mediocre.”

Resting his spear against his shoulder, he then tapped a thoughtful finger against his chin.

“Also, stop holding your spear as if I were a warthog looking for a spit,” the Izcalli added. “If you flick and duck against a human, they’ll just gut you.”

“I’m not used to fighting people,” Expendable bit back.

“Pick fights with strangers,” Tupoc suggested, then revealed he had known she was there the whole time by flicking a sly look her way. “Why, hello there stranger!”

She almost rolled her eyes. The only reason she refrained was that he fed on others reacting to his antics, much like some discount Izcalli devil.

“Tupoc,” Song replied, the nodded a polite greeting at the other man. “Expendable.”

The Malani pulled down his hat over his eyes before turning her way and returning the nod, sweat glistening around his neck. Unlike Tupoc, he was fully dressed in a regular uniform.

“Captain Ren,” Expendable nodded back to you. “Good day to you. I was just leaving.”

The courtyard walls had iron spikes nailed into them, almost like makeshift racks, and the Malani hastily put up his spear there. Song entered the courtyard and moved out of the threshold to make room for him to leave, getting a grateful nod as Expendable all but fled her presence. Song turned to Tupoc, silently cocking an eyebrow.

The pale-eyed Izcalli was standing by a barrel in the corner of the courtyard, dipping a cloth inside and washing off his sweat. When he noticed her expression, he laughed.

“I have told my cabal you are a meddlesome witch who can read their thoughts with but a glance,” he casually informed her.

Most of the half-naked men Song had seen in her life had been gravely wounded, but she had seen enough aside from that to know that there was nothing natural about the perfect symmetry of Tupoc Xical’s upper body. And when she used perfect, she meant perfect: as far as her eyes could tell there was not a single asymmetry or imperfection across the whole of him, be it the muscles of his belly or the corner of his eyebrows.

“A pointless waste of all our times,” Song replied.

“Irritating you is always worth my time, Song,” Tupoc feelingly said.

The Izcalli dunked his head into the water barrel. Song’s eyebrow cocked even higher, as while he leant down she got a glimpse of his back and found there was a tattoo between his shoulder blades. An elaborate golden coin, displaying some sort of three-headed creature made of bones. Not any Izcalli coinage she knew of. He emerged after a few seconds, shaking his wet hair – which ended up settling perfectly with barely a brush of his hand – and sighing with pleasure.

“You wanted something?” Tupoc asked.

For you to put a shirt on, you immodest harlot, she almost said. That would guarantee he went half-naked in her presence whenever it was even remotely possible for months, however, so she refrained.

“I have work for your brigade,” she said. “Tonight. I’ve come prepared to offer appropriate payment for it.”

Setting down the cloth, the Izcalli padded away on the stone to pick up a larger towel and dry himself. He kept it hung loosely on his neck afterwards, which was no shirt but better than nothing.

“So you did lose Tredegar,” Tupoc mused. “Her sitting with darling Ferranda seemed significant but it was no sure thing. Unlike your needing to hire muscle.”

There had been no avoiding his figuring that out, but it was an open secret by now anyway. Song had come prepared to take it on the nose.

“She will be leaving the Thirteenth,” she acknowledged, then moved on. “The opposition I would hire you against is a-”

“No,” Tupoc easily said.

Song’s brow rose.

“No?”

“Without Tredegar you’re not nearly as interesting,” the Izcalli shrugged. “Maryam might warrant a second look if that spite ever translates into power but Tristan, you?”

He snorted.

“There is nothing more boring than a game I’ll win every time,” Tupoc said.

Arrogance, Song thought. He was better with a spear than she was with a sword – or a spear, for that matter – but he was not better than a bullet. If she caught him at a distance, or in a place where she could snuff out the lights, Song was confident in killing him. Idly, she wondered if he was truly refusing or trying to goad her into something unwise. By the way he was standing, loose-limbed and watchful, it might just be the second.

He’d love an excuse to get her in the ring, she suspected. He seemed like the sort who thought that you could only get someone’s measure by crossing blades or something equally asinine. Unfortunately for Tupoc Xical, she was less than interested in playing his games.

“If you do not let me finish my offer,” she said, “you will regret it.”

Pale eyes light up with glee.

“Are you threatening me, Song Ren?” Tupoc smiled.

Smelling a fight, he must think. It would be satisfying to pull out the rug under him.

“Of course not,” she replied. “If I were threatening you, Tupoc, I’d be telling you that the only thing it would cost me to ruin you is an inkwell and a stack of papers.”

She leaned in.

“A sheet in front of every door on Hostel Street, with your name and the knowledge that you cannot touch bats and spiders.”

The Izcalli stiffened for the barest of moments, tried to play it out as stretching. They both knew she was not fooled in the slightest.

“Admitting you can read contracts?” Tupoc mused. “Bold. A girl could get killed over that.”

They’re already trying to kill me, Song thought. Maybe Nianzu had been right, maybe there was no winning this, but they would not bury her cringing. What was the, if she spent her life toeing the line only to end up dragged into a hole so vengeful children could torture her to death? She had used her contract without truly using it, and that had to end.

“That won’t put your secrets back in the box,” she said. “How long will the little show with your cabal work, if they know killing you is easy as putting a spider in your bedroll while you sleep? The fear would be gone, Tupoc, and not only for them. For everyone.”

Because Tupoc, clever as he was picking his battles, only still drew breath because he was strong enough to fight those battles. So long as he was too dangerous to be worth tangling with over small matters. If that balance shifted even slightly, it all came down on his head. Pale eyes hardened.

“I would kill you over that,” he said.

Calmly, like it was a common and simple thing. No more difficult than drawing water from a well.

“You’d try,” Song shrugged, unimpressed. “But it doesn’t matter, because I’m not here to threaten you. I’m here to give you a gift.”

“Well, you certainly have my attention,” Tupoc drawled. “What do you have for me, Song?”

“One,” she said.

“Copper?” he said, looking her up and down. “I’m not unwilling, mind you, but it will take more romance. At least two candlelit dinners and perhaps some of that sultry Someshwari poetry.”

She eyed him with open disdain.

“I’d bed Tristan first,” she said. “At least I would not be risking rabies.”

“All right, with talk like that I’ll bargain down to the one dinner,” Tupoc conceded.

“One reading,” Song said. “Your choice.”

He opened his mouth to try to put a knife in her, but she had seen it coming from miles away.

“It cannot be a member of the Thirteenth Brigade, past or present,” she told me.

“Tredegar’s leaving you,” the Izcalli drawled, as if she had needed a reminder. “And still you’d extend her protection?”

“Congratulations,” Song said. “You can understand Antigua. We will make a civilized man of you in a decade or two, at this rate.””

“And if I insist?” Tupoc smirked.

He asked in Centzon, because someone somewhere had failed in their solemn duty to beat an acceptable personality into him.

“The terms remain unchanged,” Song replied in the same, cocking her head to the side. “Were you somehow under the impression that your pompous smugness would make a difference?”

A small twitch, almost impossible to miss, but with eyes like hers almost was more than enough.

“I could refuse,” Tupoc said.

Trying it out as a threat. He did that often, she had noticed. Putting the words out to see if the other would react, then playing them off a jest if they did not land as he liked. The parry to that was simply not to buy in.

“You could,” Song agreed. “But you won’t.”

Because what I offer is of great worth, and you are only probing to see if I am desperate, she thought. He hummed, stroking his hairless chin. He stretched it out, as if deliberating, but she could see in the way he stood that the balance had settled.

“And what kind of gift would you want in exchange?” he asked.

“The only thing you have to give,” Song said. “Violence.”

“Now you sweet-talk me,” he complained. “Who against?”

Song told him, and why, getting an impressed whistle as answer.

“And here I thought you were the boring kind of ambitious,” Tupoc said. “That sounds like an interesting evening.”

A beat.

“I could strike that bargain,” he said. “There is only one question I’d like answered first.”

He leaned in.

“My contract, you can read it all?” Tupoc asked.

“I have no reason to answer that,” Song said.

“I’ll walk on the deal,” he casually said.

Yet his eyes were cold, belying the truth of it. The Tianxi smoothed away her displeasure. Typical of the man, he had waited to leverage her until the deal was all but done – until there was something for her to lose. She would admire the deftness, were it not wielded to her detriment.

“I can,” Song conceded. “Though I do not necessarily understand the words.”

He seemed amused.

“What’s tripping you up?” the Izcalli said. “I might be of help.”

She rolled her eyes, called the bluff.

“Yekayotl,” she said. “I could not find a proper translation.”

“You wouldn’t, it is not classical Centzon,” Tupoc chuckled. “Temple dialect. It means ‘perfection’ as a finite state of being.”

Song frowned, surprised in two different ways. The first that he would share this at all, the second at the implication. Tupoc Xical’s contract had him forever towards moving towards yekayotl, which meant his god believed his current body to be perfect. Or perhaps a ‘perfect slate’ that any deviation from was corrected by his contract.

What he did was not healing so much as pulling on aether to fix the slate – which explained why he was capable of both ‘healing’ his wounds and purging poison. Poison was not part of the slate, so it was burned out.

It was a surprisingly narrow range of immortality he boasted, Song mused. A thousand cuts would force him to draw too much on his contract, likely killing him or inflicting sainthood, while the instant death of being shot through the head would kill him before his contract could begin mending the slate and so void the pact to his god by way of death.

Much anything else, though, he would survive. And anything lost would return in time, warding him from the accumulation of wounds and fractures that years of service in the Watch inevitably brought. Though she burned with questions – had he ceased aging, why was food still necessary when poison had no effect, how had the ‘perfection’ been decided on – she held her tongue. There was a difference between being told the meaning of a single word and pawing at the deepest secrets of his contract.

“I do not know what you did to catch such a god’s attention,” Song said, “but it must have been impressive.”

Tupoc laughed.

“They always believe that,” he ruefully said. “That because my lord Grave-Given is great and worshipped by millions, he must love only the most faithful priests and famous champions. That is a misunderstanding of what he is, Song.”

“And what is that?”

“Death,” Tupoc said. “Nothing before, nothing after. That is all the Grave-Given takes into his eyes: your death. You want to know how I drew his eye, Song Ren?”

He grinned.

“The darklings thought I was dead, so they threw me in the pit with the rest of the corpses,” Tupoc said. “They swaddled me in death, broken and delirious, for three days and three nights. I drank rainwater by licking at rotting skin, heard them feast and sing above as carcasses burst and I was choked by graven flesh.”

He leaned in.

“He came to me on the last day, when the shit and sickness had seeped into my wounds. When I was good as blind and more than halfway dead.”

Tupoc laughed, drew back.

“That is what a prayer to the Grave-Given is, Song. Not glory or honor or all the pretty feathers those society fucks put in their hair. Death is the only currency of any worth, and a man should know what he’s willing to spend his only coin on.”

Those pale eyes burned with fervor.

 “Else he is good only for filling the pit.”

Song’s hands clenched.

“Why tell me this?” she asked.

“On the Dominion,” Tupoc said, “you walked around like an arrogant child. Now, though?”

He stretched out, folded his hands behind his head.

“You have the walk of someone who got a glimpse of the pit,” Tupoc said. “It has me curious.”

Words to haunt a woman in the dark of night, those.

“What is your coin worth, Song Ren?” Tupoc smiled. “I look forward to finding out.”

She forced herself to stay until she had his agreement to the deal, and not a moment more.

—

The tailor Lerato ushered her in even though she had come half an hour early, pressing tea into her hand and telling her to sit while she tended to another client. The middle-aged, homely Malani woman – southern, by the accent – intended for Angharad to sit in the front but their voices were overheard and the client in question called out.

“Is that you I hear, Lady Angharad?”

A voice she was familiar with.

“Lord Thando,” she called back. “A pleasant surprise.”

He was as pleased to see her, so instead she found herself ushered into the back to sit on a plushy armchair while Thando Fenya saw to the last details of his outfit for the very same evening she was to attend. The colorful doublet in geometric patterns was an almost nostalgic sight, though longer than she was used to. Perhaps in deference to the cool evenings.  

The matching puffy trunk hose worn over breeches was pure Malani ostentation, however, a fashion that had never taken in Peredur where a nobleman was expected to be able to ride and run.

Given that Thando was somewhat plain of face and flabby-eared she would have thought the elaborate stylings might draw the eye to that plainness, but between his golden earrings and the cut the outfit rather distracted from it instead. Impressive work, though she wondered what manner of jerkin he might complete it with.

Lerato made adjustments to the shoulder fit of the doublet while they chatted, the Malani seemingly in a fine mood.

“- quite happy to hear you would be invited,” he said. “There are too many nobles from the south and the heartlands, I feel, some Pereduri blood will do the evenings good.”

“Am I to understand that House Fenya is of northern bent?” she asked.

“Our holdings are closer to the heartlands, in truth, but I was raised on the coast of Mirror Bay,” Thando said. “We own land and manors in the region.”

As did half the noble houses in Malan. Those that could afford it, anyhow: Mother had always balked at the prices, laughing that she would get more use of another carrack. They traded pleasantries about what the lands of Llanw Hall had been like – wet, more poetically said – and commiserated about how scorching weather could get in the heartlands.

The conversation turned to whispers once Lerato left the room.

“I must congratulate you on finding the shop,” Thando said. “We have been keeping it something of a secret.”

The nobly born, he meant.

“It was recommended to me by Zenzele Duma,” she said.

“A well-dressed man, Duma,” Thando approved, thumbing his ear absent-mindedly. “A shame that having him in the same room as Shange is apt to get one of them killed.”

Which would be unproductive, so only one could be invited. As Musa Shange had blood ties to prominent izinduna and greater connections within the Watch besides, so she expected from where they stood the choice had not been all that difficult to make. She could not even deny that Lord Musa had reason to be angry with Zenzele, much as she preferred the latter man to the former.

“It seems to me there are few enough of us,” Angharad delicately said, “that brokering some manner of peace would be to everyone’s advantage.”

The Thirty-First had done her many kindnesses, over the last two weeks. It was only proper for her to return them if she could.

“Ambitious,” Thando noted. “Some would call such an attempt ill-fated, but it does not seem impossible to me.”

Merely very difficult, he was implying.

“I have dabbled in ambition, should the occasion call for it,” she replied.

“Then I advise you to linger after your time,” the Malani said. “Unless I am mistaken – and I so rarely am – Musa is to visit the shop this morning.”

Given that there was only so much time left before she needed to link up with the others to begin the journey towards Scholomance, Angharad found that news heartening. Lerato could not have many visits lined up before the hour grew too late for it, meaning her odds of catching Musa were quite good. Thando finished the last of his fittings mere minutes later, and while the seamstress went to fetch Angharad’s dress the man leaned in and lowered his voice again.

“Tread carefully tonight,” he whispered. “You are Musa’s better on the dueling field, but I expect he might be a finer blade at such affairs.”

She scrutinized his face, finding it unreadable, and nodded. He had made a choice that did not please her, on the evening she fought that duel, but it had not been perfidious or unreasonable. She would not reject an expression of goodwill from him.

“It is not my first soiree,” Angharad said, “but I thank you for the warning.”

Lord Thando took his leave after settling his bill and adding a hefty tip, which she made a note to imitate.  With Uncle Osian’s gift, she could afford it. Angharad had withdrawn her part from the Thirteenth’s account after moving into the shared house, but much of that she had offered Ferranda. It was only right if she was to eat the Thirty-First’s food, draw from their powder horns and have her clothes watched by their laundress.

Her dress was exactly as she had desired, and she tried it on while Lerato prodded her with pins one more time.

“A little tighter around the waist, I think,” the seamstress muttered. “You have the shape for it.”

It did not take long for the adjustments to be finished, but Angharad claimed another cup of tea and chatted with Lerato until her next patron arrived. And, luck of lucks, it was another familiar face: tall, braided Lord Musa Shange bent his head to pass the threshold. She feigned surprise at his arrival, which he seemed amused by, and was extended an invitation to remain and chat while Mistress Lerato saw to his clothing.

Small talk about classes – more their shared Skiritai hours than the common ones – that stayed of little import, until Angharad thanked him for the invitation. He demurred receiving the thanks, as extending it had not been his decision alone, which was the opening she was waiting for.

“How are invitations decided on, anyway?” she casually asked.

“Nothing formal,” Musa said. “General accord, I suppose, is the most accurate description.”

“So any Malani nobly born that is not strongly objected to,” Angharad leadingly said.

His full lips quirked. He had caught the meaning.

“A stain on one’s reputation would disqualify,” he said.

She put on a smile.

“And these gatherings, are they are crowded affairs?”

“One might say the exclusivity is rather their point,” Musa replied.

A polite but thorough parry to her indirectly pointing out there were few highborn of the Isles present on Tolomontera. Angharad had not expected him to be easily moved, anyhow: this was more to gauge the strength of his distaste for Zenzele. Firm seemed to be a good word for it, though not so strong he extended his anger to those trying to work peace between them.

He would not have been smiling so amusedly at Angharad’s attempts otherwise.

As with Thando, the other Skiritai waited until Mistress Lerato had left the room to turn the conversation to subjects he would rather not be overheard. Unlike Thando Fenya, however, Musa invented blatant busywork for her rather than wait.

“It is an old conceit that who we were before the Watch does not matter,” Musa said, “but I expect you will know better by now.”

Angharad frowned.

“One can fall short of an ideal without renouncing it entirely,” she said.

“How genteel!” Musa exclaimed. “But that is perhaps kinder than is deserved.”

He shrugged.

“It is tempting, I’ll admit, to swallow the lies the Watch tells about itself,” Musa Shange idly said. “Purpose and honor, the hard souls standing between Vesper and the dark. Even the covenants cut pieces off the grand delusion and claim it for their own, as if to make it easier to swallow. Yet they are very much lies, in the end.”

Angharad shot him an appalled look.

“If you believe this, why enroll at all?”

“Why do men do anything?” he laughed. “I can rise high in the Watch. Higher than I ever would have in Malan, where the best I could hope for was being my sister’s sword.”

The lordling languidly shrugged.

“I do not mean to slight the black, Lady Angharad, only acknowledge the truth of what wearing the color means,” Musa said. “It is not some sacred calling but a career like any other.”

“Only a fool would attend the classes we have simply for the salaries promised us,” she said.

“Salaries,” he chuckled. “No one sent here who will ever matter cares a jot about that, my lady. Consider instead how few covenanters there are in the Watch, and how widely spread they are across Vesper.”

He waved around.

“Anyone who survives their years here will have ties to dozens of their fellow covenanters, a well-trained cabal to rely on and multitudes of contacts across all walks of the Watch,” Musa said. “Scholomance does not graduate mere cabalists, it is forging the ruling class of the Watch for the next century.”

“And filling more than a few graves with these supposed chosen ones,” Angharad flatly said. “Supposition is one thing, but looking at the facts it is clear we are being trained for steel and not politics.”

“With the Watch, they are one and the same,” he said. “Though I will grant that the use of that accursed maneating school is… noteworthy. I expect there is some kind of game afoot with the god within.”

“There may be some truth in what you say,” Angharad acknowledged, “but there is much room for misunderstanding in painting an object seen only through a curtain.”

He only seemed amused, which had her eyes narrowing.

“Besides, I fail to grasp why you would bring up this theory to me at all,” she added a tad sharply.

“You are strong and well connected,” Musa Shange calmly said. “Someone that might go far in the Watch, with a little foresight.”

He idly picked at his sleeve.

“Which is why I find it wasteful for you to wander about so blindly,” the Malani said.

Her jaw tightened, but he raised a hand in appeasement.

“Do not swallow the lie, Angharad Tredegar,” he said. “The Rooks will devour you whole, if you let them. Instead of considering the many ways you might serve them, you ought to consider how it is the order can be made to serve you.”

The tall man smiled.

“I will be an important man, one day,” Musa said. “And I will have earned that rank, not merely inherited it. That is the Watch can give me.”

He pushed off.

“Think on what it is you want, my lady,” he added. “And if going under Ferranda Villazur is truly the best way to get it.”

Angharad was beginning to suspect she was headed to a very different kind of gathering than she had thought she was.

# Chapter 33

She could feel the eyes on her as she walked down the hall.

Whispers and stares, smirks and anticipation. Word of Song’s exoneration from the death of four students had made the rounds of Scholomance like a circling vulture, first as rumor then as fact. Every single brigade patron on Tolomontera had been instructed to report the facts as determined by a formal investigation – and four cabals were promptly disbanded, their handlers transferred away. The way Song heard it, the events becoming ‘official’ had actually lessened interest as the truth was quite time compared to some of the rumors.

Until word began going around about Professor Kang’s unfortunate encounter, anyway, which made the whole affair juicy all over again.

The other cabals had been gossiping about the coming confrontation for days, placing bets like it was to be a dog fight. It was a minute-long walk from door to door in this last hallway, a straight line with no obstruction, but the end still felt like it had snuck up on her. Song paused before the threshold, breathed in. It was not hesitation if she was just catching her breath.

Tristan casually stepped between her and a pair of gawkers, fiddling with his pistol and hiding her face from them as if by happenstance. Song hid her surprise – they had reached something of a truce over the last week, but the friendliness was but a layer and one that tended to thin whenever Maryam was not present.

She did not acknowledge the kindness and neither did he, which made it easier to swallow.

Raising her chin, Song made herself stride through the threshold. The almost crypt was better lit than usual, lanterns having been set down on the sides, but it was otherwise unchanged. Rows of desks and pillars, a menagerie’s worth of stuffed corpses and glass cases, and up front on the dais the desk and – huh. A tall, dark-skinned woman with brown eyes and hair pulled into knots encircled by golden bands at the base. No sign of Yun Kang.

Song walked to the usual desk almost in a trance, barely even noticing as the others joined her. It was barely five minutes before the last students walked in and the professor in front pushed off the desk.

“You, in the seat by the pillar,” she said, pointing at a chubby Someshwari. “Close the door.”

She turned to the class without checking to see if she was being obeyed.

“You may call me Professor Cence,” she said. “As Professor Kang is not yet capable of walking without assistance, I will be teaching this class in his stead.”

A pause for that to sink in.

“He should be returning next week,” she added. “If not, I will likely be returning.”

Whispers buzzed like a hive freshly kicked. So many stares were directed at the back of Song’s head it felt like they were pressing against her scalp. A hand was raised from the back, getting a nodded permission from Professor Cence to speak.

“Is it true he tried to get a student killed?”

Song turned, finding she did not recognize the one who spoke – an Izcalli boy with no contract to reveal his name. Impossibly, the weight of the stares grew. Even the professor glanced her way, before returning her gaze to the other student.

“Accusing a member of the Watch of a crime without proof usually fetches a caning,” Professor Cence mildly said, adjusting the collar on her uniform. “Given the rumors, I will spare you discipline this once. There will be no second chance for any of you.”

That killed any boldness students might have been inclined to. The dark-skinned professor wasted no time digging into the lessons after that, picking up where Kang had left. Song felt a little cheated by the fact that she was not as interesting a lecturer as the man trying to kill her, though the lack of constant questions thrown her way more than made up for it.

The Tianxi found herself ignored the first two times she raised her hand to answer a question opened to the class, as if Professor Cence was overcorrecting for her predecessor, but she was allowed to explain the process by which crops grew in Gloam-covered lands – skotosynthesis, feeding on darkness – and received an approving nod for it. Song did not raise her hand again for the rest of the lecture, even after the quarter-hour break that separated the two sections.

Part of her winced at what was to come, but it was necessary and her own design besides. She still waited until they’d walked out the gates of Scholomance, out of sheer practicality.

“Here will work,” Song quietly said.

Maryam nodded under her hood while Tristan gave a too-sharp grin. He was the only one of the three who enjoyed it, when they erupted into a loud argument – Song accusing him of stealing brigade funds, him accusing her of being cursed and Maryam playing peacemaker for a few moments before being called half-hollow and joining the fray. It was loud, vicious and utterly mortifying to be part of but it did what it was meant to accomplish: dozens watched as Tristan made to strike her and was held back by Maryam.

There had been witnesses enough, Song decided after they stalked off, that by the time she attended class in the Galleries this afternoon rumors would have spread. Enough that Ramona would be willing to believe her when she offered to sell Tristan Abrascal to the Forty-Ninth.

—

Tristan Abrascal slept like he was trying to burrow into the ground, even when drugged. Curled on himself, as if trying to wedge himself into the cracks of the world. Song checked his pulse, fingers lingering not a moment longer in deference to his dislike of being touched, and withdrew with a satisfied nod. The mixture and dosage were the thief’s own work, but he had asked her to check on his pulse once in a while to ensure he’d not accidentally killed himself.

The heartbeat was not slowing or weakening, so as far as she could tell he’d be fine.

Song left him in his corner, behind the crates, and climbed back up the ladder into the pale light of the Orrery. The shrine she had picked as the meeting point was small, barely large as the cottage’s kitchen and only two stories high. The selling point was that the door had been bricked in so it could only be accessed by climbing a rope to the roof and then taking a ladder down inside. Even more useful was that time had torn town everything around the strangely empty shrine for two blocks, giving her a wide open field to defend. Song lay down on the roof, pulling her coat close as she waited with her loaded musket.

All that was left to do was wait, and laying there alone her head felt full of too many thoughts. Instead of letting it wander, she made herself go through the plan again.

Looking only at martial might, dealing with the Forty-Ninth was not overly difficult.

Since Song was the one setting the meeting, all she needed to do was pick a good perch surrounded by open grounds, let them pass the point of no return then spring an ambush. Muchen He was the real threat among the brigade, so opening the fight kneecapping him with salt munitions was a must. Four would be left after that: Captain Ramona, Tengfei Pan, Huang Pan and Fara.

Huang Pan was a Savant, chubby and lacking a fighter’s calluses. As a fighter, he was a nonentity beyond his ability to pull a trigger. The Malani woman, Fara, had been somewhat of an unknown before Song made some inquiries and learned she was Arthashastra Society. Historian track, according to Zenzele. Able to fight but not a fighter and not contracted. Marginal threat.

Neither Ramona nor Tengfei would be so easy to handle, both being trained and physically fit.

The Thirteenth would be at risk of losing that skirmish of four against three, and even should they win the odds that someone would get killed were unacceptably high. If helped was sought, however? Song figured that Angharad alone would be capable of sweeping through the whole Forty-Ninth if Muchen was incapacitated. If Song reached out to the Thirty-First at large, if striking from ambush the outcome was already decided.

The complication preventing that was, ironically enough, their worst fighter: Huang Pan.

As a means of tracking, Song would consider her fellow Tianxi’s contract average. The Six-Sided Plum Blossom had granted Huang the ability to divine whether a single specific entity – object, living or divine – was in one of the cardinal directions or not. The range to the ability was nine li, the old Cathayan measure translating to short of three miles. It must be a truly ancient deity, for it not to use the imperial scales. Or at least one whose worship had hit its peak before the Second Empire.

Regardless of that interesting detail, it must be said that to hunt a fugitive Huang Pan’s contract was helpful but in practice still inferior to a well-trained hound. As a scouting tool, however? Now it became a headache. To meet the Forty-Ninth Song had naturally been forced to set a meeting place, which meant that after they approached Huang Pan could be asked to use his contract on it.

He could then confirm whether any member of her cabal was in that location, which was Tristan had to be there. None of it would have been possible without his presence, and thus assent.

Now, assuming Captain Ramona was not fool – and Song did not believe her to be one – she would also have Huang check for potential threats the Thirteenth was known to have some ties to. Like, say, Angharad Tredegar or Ferranda Villazur. Maybe even Tupoc, as he’d stepped into a confrontation between their cabals once. They would be immediately caught out and the Forty-Ninth would simply leave, the entire plan falling apart at the start.

That meant the only two people who could be there were Song and Tristan, the latter tied up as prisoner. As trust between herself and the Forty-Ninth was understandably low, Song had demanded that only two of them come take the merchandise as any more than that would make it trivially easy to double-cross her at the last moment and simple take Tristan. It wasn’t as if Captain Ramona would actually pay her so much as a copper if she could avoid it.

Of course, Muchen He backed by either Ramona or Tengfei could still likely beat her in a fight if they got close enough. But Song had known neither of the latter would come.

Across the open field, Song glimpsed Muchen He approaching with a hooded figure slight enough it should be Fara and smiled a hard smile.

As she’d expected. If Tengfei came with Muchen, Ramona would fear they’d go around her and sell Tristan themselves to get Tengfei Pan his captain’s seat back. Only if Ramona came with the Skiritai instead, she was risking Tengfei getting the support from the other two to double-cross her from the back instead. The Lierganen captain coming to Song had made one thing clear: her hold on her cabal was weak, and if she did not bring home a victory Tenfgei would supplant her again.

It was somewhat heartening for Song to realize her brigade was not the only one drowning in internal strife.

Song did not allow her musket’s muzzle to peek out over the edge as she gauged the winds, saw the curls of force in the air she would need to work with to shoot Muchen He in the head. Her finger never touched the trigger, but it was a calming thing to know she could snatch his life right out of him should she wish him. Only when they were less than a hundred feet away did she call out.

“Hands out in the open,” Song said. “No sudden movements.”

“We come in peace, Captain Song,” the hooded figure called back.

The voice confirmed her to be Fara. Good, Song could handle her if that came down to blades.

“I’m sure you do,” she said. “Do it anyway.”

Muchen, she saw in the dark, looked amused and somewhat approving. When they came close enough not to need to raise their voices, he was the one who asked how they would do the trade.

“I have him in here,” Song said. “Fara will come up to help me bring him out.”

“Ramona insisted on him being tested,” Muchen replied.

“Tested for what?”

“Being awake, and this being a trap,” the other Tianxi said. “Simple needle test, nothing inhuman.”

Song made a show of considering it, even though she had already suspected they would want something of the sort and prepared. There was a reason Tristan was drugged.

“Fine,” she conceded, “but there’s a change of plans.”

“A third is all you’ll get,” Fara snorted. “The captain was clear on that.”

“And a third is what I intend to get,” Song sharply replied. “I will be coming with you down to the port, to verify I am truly receiving such a sum.”

“That was not the deal,” Muchen said.

“It is the one on offer,” Song coldly replied. “Take or leave it.”

They hemmed and hawed, tried to argue, but deep down all knew the Forty-Nine would fold. They were in too deep and her demand was not unreasonable.

Ten minutes later the three of them – carrying a fourth – were on their way south. When they joined the rest of the brigade, she was greeted by Tengfei Pan leveling a pistol at her head.

“Lovely,” he said. “A third of the bounty just handed itself back to us.”

What a waste of a handsome face, she thought. She flicked a glance at Ramona, whose sharp scarred face was unreadable.

“My condolences,” she said, at least halfway meaning it.

Tengfei snarled, but his arm was pulled down by Muchen.

“Think,” the other man flatly said. “She has been methodically cautious so far, do you truly think she came to us without contingencies?”

Song deliberately ignored Tengfei, knowing it would anger him more than anything she might say. Irrelevance was the pond he saw himself drowning in.

“I have come to ensure my share will be correctly split,” she told Ramona. “Shall we get on with it, or do we first need to indulge another tantrum?”

“I don’t know,” Captain Ramona mused, tapping her chin. “Teng, you got another one in you?”

He did not.

—

Trading in flesh, Song learned, was brisk business.

They hid in a gutter warehouse by the docks, Tristan unceremoniously stashed behind a pile of rubble. Tengfei Pan was sent out to the Palmyran, slipping through a crumbling part of the wall and returning a quarter hour later with the caravel’s captain. The tall Someshwari woman was well into her fifties but she still had smooth skin a girlish air about her, helped along by her golden nose ring and long braid. She did not introduce herself, but then she did not need to. Chameli Kalra had a contract with the Sixfold Matrimonial Snake, so her name hung in golden letters above her head.

To constrict others with a touch was a fearsome power, Song mused, but Captain Chameli’s price was an unpleasant one: a trickle of venom, fed directly into her belly. Even recurrence immunity would only help her so much with that.

“This the boy, then?” Captain Chameli flatly asked.

“That he is,” Ramona replied. “And drugged too. Song?”

“He drank a full dose of mafeisan,” she lied. “He should be out for at least another hour.”

Tristan should, in truth, be awake by now. The poppy milk should have worn off on the way, according to the dosage he had himself measured.

“That makes things simpler,” the captain approvingly said. “We need to be careful: some galleon docked an hour ago and spat out a hundred sailors, it shook the harbor guards awake.”

“We need to move him tonight,” Ramona said. “When goes missing people will look.”

Eyes flicked to Song, who shrugged.

“I have the cabalists in hand, but our patron is a bloodhound,” she said. “He’ll come sniffing around.”

Captain Chameli grunted.

“I never said we wouldn’t do it tonight,” she replied. “Only that I’ll need one of my boys to bring a barrel first. We’ll make it look like he’s water supplies.”

“Handling that part is on you,” Ramona said. “We’ve fulfilled our end of the bargain.”

She raised her hand, rubbing thumb and forefinger. The Someshwari scoffed.

“You get paid when he’s on his way, not a moment before,” she said. “Wait here.”

They waited in strained silence as the Someshwari strode away, disappearing into the dark. Even had talking so close to the docks not been a risk, Song suspected they would have stayed silent. She could feel the tension in the air, the coil tightening. To the Forty-Ninth, this was the end of a long and rocky journey.

Which was true enough.

Captain Chameli was back, quicker than last time, with a satchel bag a thick-bearded Aztlan man whose arms were like steel bands. He was carrying a wooden barrel, which he set down without even a grunt.

“Where’s the meat?” he asked.

Tristan was pointed out to him, and it was distressing how easily the sailor pulled him up and stuffed the barrel with his body. The Someshwari captain provided a lid with two breathing holes on it, which the sailor stuck in with a single knock. He then hoisted up the barrel experimentally, for the first time showing some strain, and put it down.

“I can,” he told his captain. “Just not at a run.”

“It’ll do,” Captain Chameli grunted. “Get him going.”

That had the Forty-Ninth ruffled, several reaching towards weapons, until the older woman rolled her eyes at them. She tossed the satchel bag at Ramona’s feet.

“The coin is in there,” she said. “I’ll stay until you are finished counting.”

The Lierganen student knelt and popped open the buckles, everyone – even Song – leaning in to look at the inside of the leather bag. What awaited was stacked rolls of the largest gold coins had ever seen, which Ramona began removing. She reached out and was handed one by Huang, who then flinched when Tengfei glared at him. Ignoring the byplay, Song tested the weight and studied the coins. Ten a roll, larger than even the largest coins from the Imperial Someshwar.

They were stamped with the image of a thicket of olive trees on one side and a griffin rearing up on the other, betraying the Sacromontan origins. These were, Song realized with a start, selvas. Tribute coins, they were called, as they were minted to be worth five golden ramas coins and so useless for day-to-day use. Of the Sacromonte currency they were the rarest coins, as despite the name tributes paid to the city were usually in ingots instead of actual coinage.

There were ten rolls inside, which meant the Forty-Ninth had just been handed a sum of five hundred ramas. That was the yearly income of a wealthy trader, she thought, or an aristocrat with a respectable estate. It was, she calculated a heartbeat later, more than half over what a brigade of four would receive over an entire year at Scholomance. Gods, no wonder they had been willing to take so many risks. Even some of the princelings would think twice for such a sum.

There was a thump as a roll was thrown at her feet, then a second.

“There,” Ramona said. “As agreed, a third.”

It was not, Song almost said. Counting the roll already in her hand, three coins should be removed from another roll then two silvers provided from elsewhere. Approximately. On the other hand, by the cold looks she was receiving from the cabalists of the Forty-Ninth she suspected pushing her luck would end badly. Instead she tucked away the roll she held in her belt bag and crouched to add the other two.

It was overfull, part of a roll peeking out, which felt almost obscene.

“All finished?” Captain Chameli drily asked.

“I am,” Song said. “Ramona?”

“All paid up,” the Lierganen replied. “A pleasure doing business with you, captain.”

“Sure,” the Someshwari snorted. “If we meet again, I won’t know you.”

Without so much as a nod to any of them, Chameli Kalra turn to show them a clean pair of heels and walked away. They watched her disappear into the shadows of the street.

“Well,” Ramona mused, “they can’t all be charmers.”

A snort from Fara.

“Let’s head back,” Muchen grunted. “Staying here is a risk.”

“Agreed,” Song said, putting on feeling.

She took the lead, taking them towards Coatl Street – to the right of the cut through the Triangle they’d taken to get to the docks, but similar in length. None objected, though the pace she took was brisk enough she had to slow for a panting Huang. Bringing irritation to her fore, she let them pass before her save for Captain Ramona who stayed at her side. They still reached the place in time.

Song’s eyes lingered on mottled red shutters that looked only a stiff breeze away from falling off their hinges. The corner of Coatl Street and Lippy Lane, the door by the stooped red shutters. This was it.

“Well,” Ramona cheerfully said, “that was a productive night, wasn’t it?”

A prelude to their parting ways.

“It’s not over yet,” Song Ren replied.

In a single, smooth gesture she drew her pistol and shot Muchen He in the back of the knee. Skiritai were Skiritai, so he caught the movement – and though he could not move quickly enough, a porcelain arm sprouted to covered his knee. The salt munitions tore through it like it was wet paper, blood and bone shards splattering the ground.

There was an utterly still moment, as if no one else could quite believe what she had just done.

“What the f-” Ramona began, but then the door flew open and chaos reigned.

A bolt of darkness struck Huang Pan in the side, his sleeve catching with black and oily flames, while Tupoc leaped out through the doorway with a loud whoop – his segmented spear glinting in the light. Song tossed away her pistol reached for her blade while Captain Ramona drew hers, Tengfei Pan letting out a surprised yelp when someone threw what sounded like a rock at his head.

Fara took a skillfully thrown hatchet in the leg, Maryam stepping out of the same alley as Tupoc’s signifier.

“Ren,” Ramona snarled. “You cursed-

She moved as she spoke, swinging wildly, and Song’s lip curled with contempt. Losing your head was no way to keep it. A step back, ceding the ground, and Ramona swung again – Song caught her wrist with her free hand, tugging her already overextended form forward. She smashed her guard into the other woman’s nose, shattering something and cutting into the cheeks.

Ramona stumbled back, shouting, and Song kicked her in the stomach. That tripped her, and as she fell Song calmly approached as she kept an eye on the rest of the skirmish. Tengfei had been beaten by someone, likely Tupoc, but the Izcalli was now putting his spear at the wounded Muchen’s throat.  Maryam had needed help from Expendable to take down Fara, but they had that handled and Huang Pan was kneeling with his hands behind his head.

No longer on fire, at least.

“It’s finished,” Song said, kicking the sword out of Ramona’s hand.

The captain tried to reach for her pistol, but this time Song’s boot hammered into her chin. She swallowed a scream and did not try again. Maryam, hood down and bloody hatchet in hand came to join her.

“This the captain, then?” she asked.

Song was too slow to answer, another stepping into her shoes as the Fourth moved to secure the wounded of the Forty-Ninth.

“The very one,” Tupoc drawled. “She’s having a rough night, our friend Captain Ramona.”

Song knelt by her, the Lierganen’s bloodied face thick with hate. She spat.

“You fucked it all up,” Ramona gasped. “It was a perfectly good deal, the rat for the gold, and you just-”

“All are free under Heaven,” Song coldly replied. “We’ve killed kings to teach Vesper that lesson, Ramona. Did you truly think I would abjure it for coin?”

“Ugh, now it smells all sanctimonious in here,” Tupoc drawled, leaning against his spear and fanning his hand before his face. “Have the decency to just torture her instead, would you?”

She ignored him.

“The warehouse with our effects,” Song said. “Where is it?”

“Fuck you,” Ramona rasped. “What are you going to do, hi-”

Before Song could so much as reply, Maryam drew her hatchet at hacked into Ramona’s foot – it sank between two toes and bit down until it hit bone, the Lierganen screaming hoarsely into the night. The Izvorica, cold-eyed, then wrenched it out to the sound of a second scream.

A heartbeat of silence, then a low chuckle from Tupoc.

“That one’s on me,” he confessed. “I didn’t think Khaimov was listening.”

He was again ignored.

“Tristan’s still on the ship,” Maryam evenly said. “I’m not wasting my time being pleasant about this, slaver. If you want to enter Watch custody with limbs still attached, answer the fucking question.”

Ramona, shivering in pain and bleeding, looked up at Maryam Khaimov and saw only ice staring back. She shivered again. Song said nothing when the gaze returned to her, merely cocking an eyebrow.

“Soulless fucking hollow,” she spat, then grit her teeth and turned to Song. “Septim Street, a few minutes east of the tinker workshop. The house with the green roof, the stuff’s in the basement.”

Maryam’s hand rose again.

“It’s all I know,” Ramona snarled.

The Izvorica was eyed the other foot, but Song caught her gaze and shook her head. It was one thing to use violence as part of an interrogation, another to toy with a prisoner. Maryam grunted, then leaned down to wipe her hatchet on Ramona’s clothes. The Lierganen flinched, in no small part because the other woman chose to do it an inch below her neck.

“Once again, the Tianxi ruin everything,” Tupoc complained. “You could have let her strike the other foot, at least, make it match.”

Song would admit, to her mild shame, that on grounds of pure symmetry she considered it for half a moment. Instead she rose to her feet and dusted off her coat.

“There will be garrison officers waiting for us on Regnant Avenue,” she said. “We only need one of them to confess to have a reason to search the caravel.”

With a full company of armed watchmen, which would put every sailor on that cursed boat under arrest when they found a student imprisoned inside. They’d get to cool their heels in a goal for a few days before the Watch had them all shot and the Palmyran was appropriated as criminal property.

“Try the Malani first,” Tupoc said. “She’s already had to pay up with Lady Knit, she’ll do anything to avoid doing it again.”

That was, unpleasantly enough, probably good advice. Song opened her mouth to reply when she was interrupted by a ruckus in the distance – a few streets down, lanterns were being lit at the docks and shouts echoing across the cobblestones.

“Song,” Maryam urgently said, “what’s happening?”

Fuck, Song thought, silver eyes dipping between the islands of lantern light to see what it was that had men shouting.

“The Palmyran is trying to sail away with Tristan on board,” she hissed. “Tupoc, get the prisoners to the Watch and tell them we need to move now.”

The Izcalli raised an eyebrow even as she reached for her musket.

“And what are you going to be doing?” he asked.

“Stopping them,” she said, and broke into a run.

—

Tupoc was not one to listen to sensible orders, so Song was not surprised when he ignored hers and followed her down the street as Maryam trailed behind them. The surprise was that he’d bothered to order Alejandra Torrero to do what Song had asked of him before taking off.

The real insult was that she’d had a head start and he was still pulling ahead of her.

He was the first to run through the covenant pillars, but Song better saw what was happening out on the docks. The Palymran was still at the leftmost dock, but it was leaving. The dockworkers were arguing with a pair of large sailors untying the knots keeping them moored – and there was only one left – but neither were actually trying to stop them. The caravel was allowed to leave whenever it wished, this was all just very irregular.

She was the second past the pillar, but she slowed and Maryam shot past her as she brought up her musket. She’d hoped she would not have to fire it tonight – her arm was still fragile – but there was no time to hesitate. Slowly walking forward, she took aim and pulled the trigger.

Red bloomed on the first sailor’s forehead.

As he dropped the dockworkers threw themselves down and the other sailor panicked, reaching for a cutlass as Song began to reload. Clean, powder, ball, aim. The man was halfway through hacking down the ropes when Song’s shot pulped his throat. She broke into a run after that, hoping to catch up after the others, but horror caught in her throat when she saw Captain Chameli on the caravel deck with a blade out – and cutting the rope on her end.

Even as she ran, the Palmyran began to push off the docks.

“No,” Song shouted.

She was too far, she’d never get there in time, but the others – a glance told her they were short too, Tupoc reaching the very end of the dock as the caravel came clear of it. She saw him hesitate to leap for a moment, then back down. Maryam, who had fallen behind, was bent over and muttering when Song caught up to her.

A Sign hung before her, but by the time Song was close enough to feel its hum in the air it had collapsed.

“Come on,” Maryam whispered. “Come on. Work.”

She drew the Sign again, trails of oily darkness, but it dissipated. The Izvorica yelped, smoke wafting off the tip of her fingers. Maryam’s face was the picture of anguish, eyes rimmed red, but even so she tried again.

“Work, damn you,” she hissed. “I know you can.”

The Sign thickened, buzzing like an angry hive, but Song could already tell it would fail. It felt angry, out of control. Maryam’s mind had clouded. When it shattered, it was into jagged shards that melted a strip of the signifier’s sleeve. The Izvorica swallowed.

“Maryam,” Song said, “you cannot-”

“Work with me,” Maryam croaked out. “Please, just this once. Work with me.”

The plea echoed, rang like a bell into a world suddenly gone quiet.

And this time, when Maryam Khaimov reached for the dark, it came to her like an eager hound.

Fingers traced the Sign in hurried strokes, hers and the other’s both, until the Sign hung in the air like suspended obsidian – large as a torso, rippling like water.

“Come back here,” Maryam snarled, and slammed her fist through the Sign.

Only instead of screams and melted flesh Song saw the Gloam collapse into a spinning sleeve of crawling characters, hovering an inch above Maryam’s sleeve. In the distance, between the stripes of Orrery light, strands of Gloam coalesced into half a dozen torrents of darkness that slammed into the sails of the Palmyran.

They swelled inwards, pushed by the Gloam winds, and the caravel slowed to a crawl before stopping outright. There was shouting, which only grew louder and more panicked when the masts groaned and began to bend backwards under the furious winds – the caravel’s aft smashed into the dock with a thunderous crack.

And then the Gloam was gone, Maryam dropping to her knees and throwing up all over the docks. Song reached out for her, hesitantly, but between heaves the Izvorica slapped away her hand.

“Go,” she forced out. “Ship.”

A whoop ahead: Tupoc had not hesitated at all, it seemed. She could not afford to either.

Behind her the harbor guards were shouting, and she dared hope they would muster to storm the ship. She must buy them time to get there. Leaving Maryam behind, she ran for the edge of the docks. The caravel was not a large or a tall ship, but it was still too high for a mere leap to get her onto the deck. She had to climb the back rigging, hearing on the deck above a pistol being fired and someone screaming in pain.

She climbed over the edge to find a sword being swung at her, tumbling forward as it sliced through the air. She threw herself into the sailor’s leg, tripping them down, and then rolled away just as someone took a potshot from the forward deck. She turned just long enough to rip out her pistol and unload it in the tripped sailor’s belly, rising to her feet as she watched Captain Chameli standing at the wheel with a furious look on her face.

The Someshwari woman was looking at the docks, which were being swept by a tide of armed blackcloaks.

“Lazar,” the captain shouted. “Get the boy. We need a hostage.”

The sailor answering the call was a one-eyed, skinny cabin boy who ran towards what should be the captain’s cabin. Song ran after him, around Tupoc laughing as he swept his spear between two sailors with cutlasses. One of them was now missing most of her teeth. The cabin boy, Lazar, got to the door before she could and wrenched it open-

And got a chair smashed into his face, Tristan grunting with effort.

The cabin boy dropped and the gray-eyed thief blinked in surprise, as if surprised at how well that’d worked. Though he should have been a bound prisoner the whole time and untouched, he had somehow gotten a massive bruise on his cheek and a cut on his scalp. He was also no longer tied up, so Song had some guesses as to how that had happened.

“Song,” he said. “What in the Manes is-”

Song saw the light of the flint spark just in time, grabbing him by the neck and throwing them both down. The bullet tore into her coat and she felt a flash of heat, but when she rolled over she barely felt any blood. A graze, not a hit.

“Shit,” Tristan said, helping her up. “Come on, we need to jump into the-”

Vision swimming, she yanked him out of the way of the swing. The large sailor from earlier, the one who’d carried the barrel. He looked furious and- once, twice, thrice. A volley was unloaded into the man’s back as blackcloaks swept the deck screaming for everyone to kneel. Song did, punch drunk but hardly deaf, and a heartbeat later Tristan followed suit.

“Fuck me,” the thief murmured. “We did it.”

“We did,” Song said, if he caught the surprise in her voice he was kind enough to say.

—

In the end, only two sailors from the Palmyran survived: the cabin boy with the missing eye and the woman whose teeth Tupoc had shattered.

Both were clapped in irons after being dragged off the ship, bruised and bloody, and the rooks keeping guard were looking at them as if they were vermin. Song helped Tristan off the caravel, the thief limping – though he’d deemed his leg not broken – and leaning against her. He was noticeably uncomfortable at the touch, so she set him down by Maryam’s side. The blue-eyed woman was no longer emptying her stomach, but there were traced of bile on her chin and she still looked nauseous.

The docks were getting crowded, she saw, as another few prisoners were dragged in by hard-faced blackcloaks. The Forty-Ninth were made to kneel under the pillared temple that served as the gate to the docks, watchmen with muskets in hand looking over them.

Tupoc’s second had duly notified the garrison officers that Wen had asked to be waiting, which meant Song was able to secure the withdrawal of the Thirteenth and the Fourth with but a conversation. She was too tired to deal with Tupoc quite yet, even though manners demanded she should make an attempt, so she doubled back.

Song still had one conversation left before the curtain call. Maryam was passed out and snoring when she returned, the gray-eyed thief watching over her like a hawk.

“It might be best if she slept at the Meadow tonight,” Song whispered. “I have never seen her wield Gloam on such a scale before.”

Tristan looked down at the Izvorica fondly.

“Leave her for a bit more,” he said, then groaned and stretched out. “We are due a talk, anyhow.”

Song inclined her head. They did not go far, only to one of the many stone benches near the dock walls. He sat first and she kept room between them when following. For a moment they sat there in the dim lights of the Orrery, watching the stripes of pale carving across the distant dark.

“I owe you,” Tristan said, sudden and blunt. “What do you want for it?”

She did not answer immediately. The urge was there to ask him to stay with the Thirteenth, but she knew better. He would accept, she thought. The Sacromontan was, in his own way, ruthlessly scrupulous about debts. He would do it, but then Tristan would see being part of the brigade as chains and her as his debtor.

And he was not the kind of man to ever trust a debtor.

“I would like,” Song finally said, “for the two of us to have an honest conversation.”

He studied her for a moment.

“Are you sure it can’t be anything else?” he asked, tone almost whining.

“Certain,” Song drily replied.

His goddess leaned over his head, saying something Song could not hear, and she could see his cheek muscles tremble the slightest bit as he forced himself not to react.

“Proceed,” he said. “I think I have a concussion, anyway, which is about two thirds of honesty.”

She hesitated, but not even a heartbeat. Breath before the plunge.

“I can see your goddess,” Song said. “And your contract.”

He cocked an eyebrow at her.

“I’m aware.”

The red-dressed goddess leaned in too close and tried murmur something into Song’s ear. The closeness was overly familiar, but the knowledge that she was not truly ‘there’ helped make it somewhat tolerable.

“I cannot hear her, however,” Song noted.

“Lucky you,” Tristan frankly said.

Her lips twitched at the utterly outraged looked on the redclad goddess’ face, and the apparent furious berating that ensued. Not that the levity was destined to stay for long.

“I have never heard of anyone being visited so often by their god without turning into a Saint,” she said. “I have been expecting you to turn into one for months, and…”

She frowned, looking for the right words.

“That you did not turn into one was almost as alarming,” Song admitted. “It meant you were breaking the rules, somehow, and I could not hope to predict the consequences.”

The thief stared at her, grunted.

“It’s been-”

Song raised a hand to interrupt him.

“You don’t need to tell me,” she said. “I do not bring up the matter to seek answers of you. It has been pointed out to me that I have not earned the right to ask them from you.”

He grimaced.

“I can understand the concern,” Tristan said, and it was an olive branch of sorts.

He bit the inside of his cheek.

“It’s been this way for years,” he said. “If I was going to turn into a Saint, I already would have.”

“That is reassuring to hear,” she admitted. “I expect having been exposed her wiles for years will have inured you some.”

He slowly blinked.

“Her what now?”

“Her wiles,” Song repeated, stressing the syllables in Antigua. “Did I mispronounce it?”

“Oh Manes,” Tristan muttered, “you can’t hear her.”

“I cannot,” Song hesitantly confirmed. Again.

The thief met her eyes square on and laid a hand on her shoulder, face seriously.

“Song, Fortuna is terrible,” he said, tone heartfelt. “And I don’t mean it in some eldritch way, I mean that she is bad at existence.”

Song paused. Opened her mouth, then closed it. Swallowed.

“She couldn’t trick a child into doing her bidding even with an entire barrel of candied dates,” Tristan said, taking back his hand. “She has lost arguments to pigeons.”

Pigeons. As in plural?

“So all the talking,” Song trailed off.

“Today she’s mostly been complaining about how Hage banned her from the Chimerical and insisting I should buy Maryam some blue ribbons we saw on Templeward,” he said.

A pause.

“They’re overpriced,” he added. “I’m not paying silver for those.”

Song felt a little faint. The goddess, Fortuna, she was only one of the troubles between them but certainly one of the larger ones. A constant presence she must pretend not to see, a poisonous whispering ghost trying to tip the thief past the line of Sainthood.

To learn she had been rhetorically defeated by at least two pigeons was something a blow to her believed understanding of the situation.

Song passed a hand through her hair, somewhat at loss as to what she should say. Apologize, for having never asked? It seemed meaningless when they both knew he would never have told. She settled on something simpler, if no less true for it.

“My god is also a jackass,” she told him. “I sympathize.”

His face went still, for a moment, and then to her surprise he burst out laughing so loudly it echoed across the water. He swallowed it, held it in, but then their eyes met again and it escaped his belly as Song found herself joining in. By the time she stopped her cheeks ached and her belly hurt. It took a while for the two of them to gain back their breath, the pants their only sound aside from the quiet lick of the sea against the docks.

“All right,” Tristan suddenly said. “Fine.”

Her heart caught.

“Fine?” she asked.

“I make no promises for how long,” the thief said.

“I did not ask for any,” Song serenely replied.

Tristan grunted, sounding displeased.

“I already bought the carrot seeds, it’d be a waste not to use them,” he argued.

“It would be,” she agreed.

He scowled at her.

“The lack of smugness makes it worse,” he complained.

“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Song Ren lied.

Tonight, she decided, had been a good night.

# Chapter 34

Even with Ferranda’s help it took Angharad an hour and a half to prepare herself for the evening.

Her hair was pulled back into neat braids bound by glass beads, her eyebrows freshly plucked and her eyes painted with black henna. The most care, however, had gone into fashion. Angharad had decided to hew close to Pereduri fashion, in part because she simply could not afford a dress’ worth of inyosi fabric. Malani wax-print, as it was called away from the Isles, was expensive even in the heartlands of Malan: out here the price of even a single bolt was ruinous. Ingwenya cotton would suffice, and in her opinion breathed better anyhow.

Besides, with House Tredegar being struck from the rolls of nobility it was debatable whether Angharad was still allowed to wear wax-print. As she was no longer a subject of the High Queen her sumptuary laws should not, in principle, still apply. And yet. It was Malani fabric, and a daughter of the Isles who would wear it. Part of her hesitated. Some habits, she thought, would be long in the shaking.

Pereduri gowns tended almost universally to the low-waisted and tight, with personal inclination expressed through necklines, sleeves and skirts. Angharad settled on an Izcalli cut, a straight line beneath her collarbone that left her entire neck and much of her shoulders bare. The cut was popular in Malan as well, though not sleeved as she chose: puffed at the shoulder and slimming down to end at the wrist.

It left the first few silver stripes on her arm bare, as much a decoration as the pair of orange Uthukile bead bracelets matched the red and yellow stripes of the dress fabric. A wide cowhide belt circled her waist, fitted with her saber’s sheath. And that made for accessories enough. She had chosen, in deference to her means, not to pay a visit to a jeweler.

For an unmarried noblewoman the traditional skirts would be paneled, with the train just short enough one could easily walk, but Mistress Lerato had instead suggested a loose wrap that would show off a parted red petticoat and elegant soft leather boots. I rarely get to dress a woman with such long legs, the seamstress had said, it would be a waste not to use it.

The effect was just a touch scandalous, the sort of thing Mother had loved wearing, so in a fit of nostalgia Angharad agreed even though the boots were really quite costly – made by another shop on Templeward, recommended by Mistress Lerato. A wardrobe appropriate for formal occasions was always expensive, she reminded herself, but no less necessary for it.

Still, she was glad of the wrap skirt and parted petticoat when she made her way to the guesthouse near the eastern end of Templeward – there would have been no handmaid to pick up a longer trail if it dirtied on the street, and to use duelist’s straps for anything but their stated purpose was quite uncouth.

Having parted ways with Ferranda halfway down the street when her soon-to-be captain ducked into a clockmaker’s shop to browse the trinkets, Angharad was alone when she arrived at the Colored Arches at precisely ten before seven. Shortly before she was expected, though still late. Lord Thando had informed her the gathering would begin before but she was to come later, to allow for any last moment objections to her presence to be raised should there be a need.

If one was raised and upheld it was always possible that she would be dealt the humiliation of being refused at the door, but Angharad doubted that would be the case. Odds were at least one soul within might enjoy insulting her, but most would not and that would carry the day – why force bad blood with all of them where there had been none? Simpler to refuse her the invitation in the first place. Not unaware she was dithering out of nerves, Angharad straightened her back and finished making her way down the street.

The Colored Arches, to her mild surprise, looked more like a tavern than the kind of banquet hall she had been expecting. It was a long, sloping building whose wooden façade had been recently built but was painted a discreet dark green. Its only mark was a hanging sign displaying a hut made of colored streaks of light, a similarly discreet reference to one of the eldest spirits of Malan: the Cloud-Brewer, known to delight in harvests and feasts.

She rapped her knuckles against the painted door only once before it opened.

A man in dark green livery promptly ushered her in with a smile, welcoming her in the crisp Umoya of the Middle Isle’s heartlands. Dark-skinned as only the folk of those Glare-scorched lakelands could be, the servant cut a neat and friendly figure as he guided her through a short antechamber where another servant wiped her boots and she was offered a basin of warm water to wash her hands from the stink of the streets. Her black cloak – she had elected not to further thin her funds by having one made – was skillfully taken off her while the first of the servants led her towards the door.

“Lord Thando Fenya asked for the honor of bringing you in, my lady,” he said. “He should be along momentarily.”

“Thank you,” she said, inclining her head, then cocked an eyebrow. “Yanga or Madevu?”

He looked surprised at the mention of the two principal regions of the heartlands, but pleasantly so.

“Madevu, my lady,” he said. “Near the city of Inende, at the beginning of the cataracts.”

“Oh, further west than I would have guessed,” Angharad told him. “I never had the pleasure of visiting Inende, alas, as the dueling circuit always chose Ukuzi for the contests.”

A shame. Ukuzi was remarkably easy to reach, being at the confluence of several great rivers, and the second largest city of the heartlands was a bustling center of industry. Yet the expanding reach of stone and steel had swallowed much of the surroundings. In contrast, the western reaches of Madevu were still wild and the great waterfalls there were said to be a thing beauty.

“There is no better road than a river,” the man quoted with a chuckle. “Besides, my lady, it rains much the year in Inende. It is from the High Isle’s westerwinds.”

Was it now? Angharad had never heard such a thing before and was rather charmed that Peredur’s occasionally temperamental weather seemed to be passing to its neighbors as well, but before she could ask of these westerwinds the door opened. A servant offered her a smile, brushing back her bound hair, and stepped out of the way so that Lord Thando Fenya could go through.

The man, she would admit, cut a finer figure than she would have expected of a man not blessed with particularly good looks. His long-sleeved doublet and matching puff trunk hose were in colorful inyosi fabric, displaying eye-catching geometric patterns in blue, white and red but over it he had thrown a long, open black jerkin that went down to his thighs. She had not noticed this morning, but the inside of his collar has some subtle blackwork sown to match it.

He had so many gold rings on his fingers and tinkling bangles on his arms he would hardly have been able to wield a sword even if he had one belted at his hip instead of a bejeweled dagger.

“Lady Angharad,” he happily said. “And early, I see!”

“Am I?” she asked. “I can wait, if there is need.”

“I would never dare,” Thando chuckled. “Come, let me show you to the salon.”

She smiled back, turning to nod her thanks at the servant whose name she had never learned – only to find him gone, along with all the others who had lent her a hand. Impressive training. Thando walked her down a short hallway, then through an open door to an almost wistful sight: a richly decorated drawing room filled with nobly born peers of her age. Just like a tournament evening, she thought.

Thando stepped in ahead of her and theatrically swept his arms, claiming attention from all the guests.

“It is my great pleasure,” he announced, “to introduce Lady Angharad Tredegar of Llanw Hall.”

Angharad gave a shallow curtsy – not the lady’s curtsy but the duelist’s, one hand on her saber – and was met with a retort volley of curtsies and bows. A quick look through the room told her that, counting herself and Thando, there were eleven guests in the hall. At once more and fewer than she had been expecting. Only two servants stood within, waiting to the side with alert faces, though one immediately approached her with a tray of crystal glasses.

“A Totochtin red, my lady, if it please you,” the servant offered.

“It does,” Angharad replied, deftly claiming a glass.

Ancestors, it really was like a circuit evening – there too, no one would be caught dead drinking Malani wine. The Isles were known for their beers and liquor, not the fruit of the vine. As her tacit sponsor for the evening, Thando did not throw her to the wolves but instead stay with her to make introductions and ease her into mingling. Pure happenstance, of course, that this came with the side effect of deepening their association in the eyes of the other.

She could not tell if he was still trying to recruit her, but he was going out of his way to make ties – and to make them in the eyes of these guests. You have enemies here, Thando, she thought. Or at least foes. One did not wage a war of maneuver with scarecrows.

As if to test her, or warm her up, they began with one of the easier figures – and one passingly familiar from the general classes.  Lord Kasigo Njezi, a fresh-faced man with a boyish grin, was from the Twenty-Third Brigade. His doublet was ingwenya cotton, like her dress, and subdued in pattern if not in color. His hose was an unremarkable pale cream, drawing the eye instead to his elaborate boots – soft, knee-cavalier boots in calfskin with beadwork rims.

Unlike Thando, he had slender sword at his hip.

“I had hoped to see you on these evenings,” Kasigo said, shaking her hand enthusiastically.

That it had not even occurred to him to offer to kiss it was, Angharad would admit, somewhat charming.

“It is a missed opportunity not to have earlier conversed,” she replied.

Lord Kasigo, she learned, was a Laurel – diplomat track, like Zenzele, who he seemed acquainted with. And not unaware of the feud binding him to Musa Shange, by the look he shot Musa at the mention of Angharad’s friend. The way he changed the subject to the coming Theology report after that, almost hasty, let her place him in the pecking order here: he was at the bottom, relying on being inoffensive to maintain his position at the table.

She steered them out of the conversation not long after, pretending not to notice how Thando’s calculating eyes took her measure all the while. He must have judged her fit for greater challenges, who they ought out afterwards: a pair, of which knew only a man she misliked.  Musa Shange was the first to talk, and she had to admit he looked like a woodprint of a courtier: his doublet thin and with an elongated diamond of an opening to display his muscled chest and stomach, paired with an open jerkin richly lined with fur and tapered hose.

Musa wore no jewelry save for a heavy ivory medallion hanging on a golden chain, inscribed with a prayer to the Sleeping God on one side and what must be the Shange heraldry on the other, but what did that matter when not a single article of clothing he wore would have fetched less than gold?

“Lady Angharad,” he drawled. “We meet again.”

“Lord Musa,” she replied, inclining her head. “Good evening.”

At odds or not, it was only with the man’s assent she had been able to come here tonight. That warranted manners from her, and even some cordiality. The other Skiritai promptly committed the courtly equivalent of stepping on Thando’s foot by introducing his companion before the other man could.

“I present you Lord Zama Luvuno,” Musa provided. “Signifier for the Eighth Brigade.”

Any brigade with a number below ten was not to be trifled with, much less a Navigator who she might have thought a soldier from the contour of his silhouette. Angharad traded a curtsy for a short nod. Lord Zama was not much inclined to conversation, it seemed.

“Lord Zama is royal blood twice removed,” Thando added, not to be cheated of his role entirely.

That would make him two generations of descent from the child of one of the Queen Perpetual’s many consorts – a diluted relation, admittedly, and by the laws of Malan not royalty at all. Her Majesty’s blood, however, carried a certain prestige no matter how rare the drops had grown. The man was handsome enough in his golden doublet that Angharad understood why the High Queen might have wanted one of his kin as consort. Not her sort of dish at all, but it had been well-cooked.

Lord Zama rolled his eyes at the words, but nodded in confirmation. That made twice.

“Apologies,” Angharad began, “but are you perhaps…”

The man nodded again. Mute, then. Unfortunate, as Angharad barely knew anything of sign language – and not of the one in common use, anyhow, but the naval one taught to her Mother. Izcalli finger-talk was considered the Vesper standard, and was significantly more elaborate. No pun intended, although she would take it.

Unfortunate twice over was that Lord Musa evidently did know finger-talk, and signed something at Lord Zama that had the man chuckle. Angharad spent most of the ensuing talk trying to ferret out the nature relationship between the two as Musa translated for the other lord. Not one between the sheets, unless they were skilled at keeping those signs away from prying eyes, but it was friendly enough. Something was itching at her, though, and it took her a moment to realize what.

Musa was treating the other man like an equal, which she’d almost never seen from swordmaster.

Neither is vassal to the other, she decided. She knew little of the Eighth Brigade, but it was well-backed enough that the Ninth’s own connections warranted no precautions from Lord Zama. While chewing on that, she almost missed when the talk turned to the ‘Abbey’, the site of the classes for the Akelarre students. It was Musa translating for Lord Zama that dragged her back into the moment.

“He wonders if you were aware that your fellow cabalist Maryam has not stepped foot in the Abbey proper since the first day,” Musa said.

“She has found other instruction, I hear,” Angharad shrugged. “I am not greatly involved in Maryam Khaimov’s affairs.”

“It would be strange to have a Triglau in one’s cabal,” Thando mused.

“Agreed,” Musa said. “Though I suppose being able to bring a servant even in Scholomance would have its uses.”

Chuckling, even as Angharad frowned.

“She is a student,” she reminded them, though she did not go as far as saying ‘same as us’.

It was too close to a lie for comfort.

“No one says otherwise,” Musa dismissed, “but service is in their blood, Lady Angharad. Left to their devices, they would collapse back into barbarity and destroy all the industry we brought to their lands.”

That might be true, Angharad assessed, but was being spoken with a phrased certainty that was making her rather uneasy – so was the way Lord Zama nodded, as if this were known fact.

“She is Izvorica, not Triglau,” she informed them instead of arguing the point. “A people within the greater whole, I understand, but distinct.”

Lord Zama’s fingers flashed in a quick sequence, Musa snorting at the sight.

“Pereduri indeed,” he translated.

Angharad was beginning to dislike Lord Zama.

Thando, perhaps sensing the rising tensions, eased them out of the conversation and by claiming he was in need of drink. Angharad followed him towards the tray-bearing servant, enjoying the respite.

“As I mentioned this morning,” he murmured, “this hall is heavy with the opinions of the south and the heartlands.”

“You do not share their thoughts, then?” Angharad asked.

“My kin are career watchmen, which makes me abolitionist by default,” Thandi said, though he did not sound all that enthusiastic about it. “But it is, well, did you ever hear about that mess up in Isilide about four years back?”

It took her a second to place the name. A city, well in the north of Malan but short of the Low Isle.

“The riots that had cloth workshops set ablaze,” she recalled. “An accident, I heard.”

Disorder always brought ruin.

“It was no accident,” Thando flatly said. “The lady of Isilide opened new wax print workshops and manned them with slaves. It is a profitable trade good, Angharad, but also profession. Skilled workers with lifelong training and patterns kept within their families. The new workshops paid not a soul inside and so they sold their cloth at half the price.”

Which would have been death on the old workshops. Only nobles were allowed to wear inyosi, so the greater profit in it for merchants was in truth from sales abroad. Even if the new wax print was of lesser quality, traders would likely choose it – the margins would be strikingly better, and it wasn’t as if some Someshwari lordling would be able to tell the difference.

 “So they set the workshops on fire?” she said, appalled.

“And threatened to do the same to any opened in years to come,” Thando said. “They were feted as heroes in the city, so the lady had to back down.”

Angharad felt torn – on one hand, to rise against one’s sworn lady was dishonorable. On the other, there was honor in acting to defend one’s kin and calling. Thando shrugged, taking the glass of red from the tray he had come to fetch.

“I will not speak to the souls of these Izvorica,” the Malani said after a sip, “but slavery is mostly to the benefit of the rich. Besides, it is not good for the health of a realm to have too many slaves.”

Slowly she nodded. That much seemed plain truth: the Izcalli had more slaves than anyone in the world, though they called them serfs, and their nation was constantly wracked with unrest. Besides, Mother had mentioned that the western colonies were all the property of the crown and the greatest izinduna – though lesser lords were beginning to form associations to pool their means in order to sponsor their own.

“What happened to them?” she asked.

“The workers?” Thando blinked. “As I told you, the lady backed down. A few arrests were made for appearances but that was all.”

“The slaves, I mean,” Angharad said.

“Ah,” Thando grimaced. “They were, I hear, inside the workshops when those were set aflame.”

Angharad breathed in, looked away and drank deeply of her wine. One could go for a long time sifting through that for a speck of honor.

“Come,” Thando said, sounding almost sympathetic. “This one should be more to your tastes.”

The Pereduri felt a twinge of resentment at how well he had pegged her when she was introduced to Captain Emeni Maziya of the Twenty-Ninth, a wonderfully tall woman whose green and yellow off-the-shoulders gown bared impressively muscled shoulders and the contours of a generous figure. Malani preference for high-waisted gowns could be forgiven, when serving to prop up such a… cause.

“A pleasure,” Angharad smiled, bending to kiss her hand.

A hand with callouses to match the iwisa at her hip, she noted, a round-headed mace that saw more use in ceremonies than war but would crack a skull nonetheless. And a woman would not, Angharad mused, get hands like these without regularly swinging it around.

“Flatterer,” Lady Emeni laughed. “You see, Fanyana? This is how it’s done.”

Her companion, Fanyana, was a sullen man with a plump face and a tightly buttoned jerkin that was a veritable riot of silver scrollwork and silver buttons. Even the long sword at his hip was silver, be it the sheath or grip. His hair was a neat cloud that Angharad suspected must have taken twice as long to style as her own.

“I am not so free with my lips, Emeni,” he stiffly replied.

The man was taller than her, Angharad realized, but stood so stooped one hardly noticed.

“Lady Angharad,” Thando stepped in, “I give you Lord Fanyana Khosa.”

A pause.

“Yes, from those Khosa.”

Angharad almost goggled at the man. The same House of Khosa who were the once-kings of the March, last of the Malani highborn to kneel when the High Queen unified the Middle Isle? Angharad saw little of those great warrior kings in the scowling man, but she supposed it was not her place to judge. The House of Khosa had been an unbroken line of izinduna since the Union War, and such a thing merited great respect.

To be a lord or lady on the rolls one needed only to be born nobly, but to be induna was something greater – set above by the Queen Perpetual, marked as great. That distinction it was something that could be passed to your children, but not by their own unless they earned the honor anew the same way you had. That is to say by owning land on the Isles, commanding troops and carrying out a deed worth the recognition of the court.

The Khosa had achieved this without fail since the Century of Loss, Angharad could believe in that even if the Khosa in question did not so far impress.

Alas, as they chatted on the most neutral matter Thando had been able to offer up – whether or not the Uthukile winter storms were the single worst on Vesper – Angharad was grieved to deduce that the bountiful Lady Emeni was likely involved with Lord Fanyana. While she would never complain at such a woman leaning forward so frequently, it was not for her eyes but the red-eared Khosa’s that the charms were being displayed.

Lady Emeni also seemed acquainted with Ferranda, asking of her health, though Lord Fanyana was visibly indifferent to the matter. He thinks it beneath him, Angharad decided. He might not even be wrong, given his birth. More interesting was when the charming captain mentioned her recent tea with Captain Nenetl of the Third, a hint as to where she stood. A foe to Musa Shange, almost certainly, given the infamous enmity between Nenetl Chapul and Musa’s own captain.

If Angharad was to look for allies here, Emeni Maziya was a good start. That and she must be careful not to make too much of a mess pressing her intentions, else Lord Fanyana was likely to oppose her on the simple grounds of misliking crassness.

Still, Lady Emeni’s continued advances were so cheerful a seduction that the Pereduri left their company rather cheered. Lord Fanyana was a gloom cloud, but not entirely without humor – his quip about the great curse of the Towers Coast being called the Imperial Someshwar had been quite droll.

“Ah, the last four are together,” Thando mused. “Into the breach, Angharad.”

He hesitated.

“Do not take the twins personally.”

As forecast, the last four guests were standing by an elegant Tianxi landscape while sipping at their drinks. Three of them women, the sole man introducing himself so happily and so eagerly that Thando did not even have the time to preempt him.

“Awonke Bokang, Third Brigade,” he said, shaking her hand. “Capital to meet you.”

His doublet was positively dripping with colored beads in the Uthukile style and he wielded a Low Isle accent thick enough it would not flinch under bombardment. He was Umuthi society, she soon learned, and most interested in the saber her uncle had gifted her. So was the second of the lot to be introduced, Lady Lindiwe Sarru.

That one Angharad had already known the surname of, for she was Skiritai.

“Impressive work with the chimera yesterday,” Angharad told her, trading duelist’s curtsies. “It was skillful strategy how your crew trapped it into the house.”

“And you with that satyrian,” Lady Lindiwe replied. “It was rather satisfying to see one handily dispatched after the last chewed up most of that crew on our first day.”

“Salvador’s contract allows us to take risks most cannot,” Angharad demurred.

She took a close look at the woman for the first time, noting that for one who spoke Umoya like a southerner it was unusual for her to be bearing a saber a hand’s span longer than Angharad’s own – and even though Lindiwe Sarru was shorter than her! Her dress was classic Malani court attire, high-waisted yellow inyosi fabric with dark brown double lines adorned by matching rings. The high collar and layered sleeves paired with a long train, almost trailing behind, had been the fashion in the capital last she heard.

Not so the two green skirt ribbons fluttering on her side, which no matter how dainty could only be duelists’ straps – meant to hike up the skirt and tie it back to the belt to free the legs should there be a need for a duel.

“A surfeit of humility,” Lady Lindiwe frankly said. “Still, I am glad to finally have another Skiritai among us. Next time I ask have these little evenings moved on the evening of the week I did not spend the afternoon in a fighting pit, perhaps I will get fewer comments.”

Ah. Angharad had wondered why the event was moved by a day, though for the same reason freshly outlined she had not been inclined to complain.

“I would not count on it.”

She turned to the speaker. The twins, Thando had called them, and they were very much that. More to Angharad’s delight, the pair were slender beauties with sultry dark eyes wearing silver bands with striped veils going down their backs.

At first glance they seemed to be wearing the same striped black and white ingwenya dress, but it was an illusion – the positions of the black and white were reversed, on both the veil and their elegant paneled dresses. Their wear was different from her own Izcalli cut not due to the cloth but by virtue of having silver netting over where Angharad’s shoulders were bare, and the pearl necklaces they wore: one broad, halfway down the shoulder, and the other at the base of the beck.

As with everything else, they contrasted shades with each having one necklace of black pearls and the other in pale.

“If I might introduce the ladies Branwen and Morcan of House Emain,” Thando said. “They may even, at some point this evening, deign to reveal which is which.”

“I would not count on that either,” the rightmost twin noted.

Even if she had never heard their names, that faint undertone to the Umoya would have told Angharad they were Pereduri as surely as the low waist of their dresses. They both cocked eyebrows at her and offered their hand to be kissed, which presented Angharad with the delightful dilemma of which knuckle to grace first. She chose the first to address her, to an inscrutable expression from both beauties.

The leftmost twin then addressed her in Gwynt, which Angharad grasped parts of. Something about ‘gray’, ‘region’, and a term meaning ‘sea-and-stone’ that was an old-fashioned byword for Peredur itself. The lady spoke quickly and in an antiquated manner, however, so Angharad was soon lost.

“I did not understand you,” Angharad replied in the same tongue.

The twins shared a look, one of them sighing.

“Evidently,” Lady Emain replied, in Umoya.

“It was a pleasure, Lady Maraire,” the other Lady Emain added.

The use of House Tredegar’s name on the Malani rolls of nobility was a clear dismissal, which Angharad would admit stung a bit. She had hardly met any others from home since leaving it, to have such a distance put there from the start was something of a blow.

As did the fact that she had come across beautiful Pereduri twins only for them to be… unnecessarily scathing, to put it gently. Between Emeni being taken with the Khosa earlier and now this, the dinner was looking to be slim pickings. It was a little unfair of the world to make it so. Neither Lord Bokan nor Lady Lindiwe seemed all that surprised by the way the ladies Emain had acted, or the way they then walked away after the barest sketch of a curtsy.

“I think Morcan is the one with the small black pearls,” Lord Awonke noted as they watched the pair retreat. “She glares like I am insect, not a rat.”

It was an effort for her lips not to twitch.

“She has to be Branwen,” Lady Sarru contradicted in a murmur. “She only implied that my entire bloodline are fresh-faced upstarts underserving of nobility the once, which would make her the friendly twin.”

“Is House Emain so ancient?” Angharad asked. “I would not call myself unlearned in the matter of the peerdom but I am not familiar with the name.”

Admittedly it sounded like a name from southwestern Peredur, which she was less learn in, but if they were a great house she was certain she would know of them.

“The sisters are descended from two war captains that came to Peredur during the First Landing,” Thando provided. “Or so is claimed.”

That was a hallowed lineage, Angharad would concede. Most of the first ships to land to make shore on the duchy’s stony beaches had been slaughtered by the old lords of the land, save for a few distinguished captains who raised driftwood halls after either wedding or vanquishing the locals. Often a little of both. In a sense those captains had been the eldest nobles of Peredur, though few of these ancient houses were now prominent.

Given that Peredur was said to have been the first land reached by the ships of Morn, which kept sailing to the Middle and Low Isle after a grisly blooding, it was an old argument that their bloodlines could be considered the first nobles not only of Peredur but of all Malan. And thus the noblest of all, by some interpretations. Mostly from those who would benefit from such an honor.

“If they had anything to boast of but their blood, they would,” Lady Lindiwe drily said. “I would not be surprised to hear House Emain rules naught but a manor and a stony beach.”

Angharad slid her a look. Some might describe the lands of House Tredegar in such a manner, though of course there was more to them than that. She was debating what to say when a bell was gently rung, drawing the attention of the guests to the same smiling man who had greeted her at the door.

“Dinner is ready,” he announced. “If you would follow?”

Handed the opportunity to let the matter lie, Angharad took it.

—

A single, long table was to host the veritable banquet they were served.

As the guest of highest birth, Lord Fanyana Khosa sat at the head of the table and the rest of them settled five on each side. Angharad found herself between Thando and Lord Zama, which at least simplified the matter of conversation. On the other side the closest were Lord Kasigo and Lady Emeni, both of which were glad sights. Well, for the pleasure of the eye more one than the other but conversationally speaking the balance was closer.

Malani feasts were long, drawn-out affairs and this looked to be no exception. The first service was a traditional chicken and vegetable stew, exquisitely spiced, and in its wake maize beer was brought out. Angharad had finished her wine, so she accepted a cup. With the beer now on the table, conversation began in earnest. News from abroad, at first, as was custom.

“It may be war is brewing in the Someshwar,” Lord Fanyana shared, living up to his seat. “The Ramayans are squabbling with the Upani over their eastern enclaves.”

That was met with some cheer, as war in the Imperial Someshwar tended to be good for business. With the roads made unsafe by roving armies, sea trade always picked up. That and should the war last too long Sunflower Lords were like as not to get involved, which would then see steel and powder rise sharply in value.

By the time fresh steamed bread was served along with curry, the discussion had moved instead to Thando’s intriguing mention of a flurry of diplomatic delegations between the Ten Republics.

“It is an open secret that the Sanxing were busy courting the central republics to support their colony plans when the Dimming happened,” Lady Emeni opined. “Like as not, now that the situation in Jigong has hit the bottom of the barrel they are taking the pulse of the current sentiment.”

More than a few glances slid Angharad’s way at the mention of Jigong, which was understandable. She was still nominally under the command of a Ren, something which everyone present seemed to understand the meaning of. It might not have been so at the beginning of the year, the Pereduri supposed, but Professor Yun Kang had ensured otherwise.

“It is said that Song Ren of the Thirteenth is a direct relation of the man behind the Dimming,” Musa lightly said.

Angharad sipped at the beer. Only to be expected that Musa would be the one to bring her into this, so she had been keeping one eye on the rest of the table. One reaction stood out: Lady Lindiwe Sarru rolling her eyes. No friend of Musa’s, then. She’d not had the opportunity to learn what brigade the other woman belonged to yet, but it was now her intention to.

“Chaoxiang Ren was her grandfather,” Angharad replied. “Though she was born years after the event in question, of course. Her personal honor is unstained.”

Murmurs of agreement all around, but the general sentiment was plain: bad goods, broken goods. No fault of hers, but best kept at arm’s length. She pushed down the urge to argue. Angharad’s  disinclination to share more on the matter saw the subject move on, towards talk of unrest in the Kingdom of Sordan over terms of peace. The Treaty of Concordia had been signed eighteen years ago, and seen Sordan become a tributary of Izcalli while the port of Concordia was ceded to Malan. Some Sordans were said to be agitating for the trade port’s return to the fold.

“We would not need to hold it at all, had they not bent over the for izzies during the Sordan War,” Lord Awonke snorted. “Without a royal fleet base in the Trebian, Izcalli is sure to try to close the Auric Strait when they next have themselves a war.”

Angharad had never been all that interest in matters of greater policy, but it was common knowledge that one of the main goals of the Queen Perpetual over the last two centuries had been ensuring that the Auric Strait, connecting the Straying Sea to the Trebian, could never be closed to Malani ships by the Kingdom of Izcalli. Or anyone else, for that matter.

“Everyone shafted Sordan during the peace of Concordia,” Lord Kasigo opined. “Malan, Izcalli, even the Watch when they brokered the whole affair. They have reason to be angry, not that it will lead to anything but the royal fleet anchoring a squadron in bombardment range of their capital.”

Lord Zama signed, Musa leaning forward to read his fingers before speaking.

“Or the Grasshopper King sending Doghead Coyac to scare them back into submission,” Musa conveyed.

Some snorts, but Angharad raised an eyebrow.

“I am unfamiliar with the name,” she said.

“One of the leading generals in Izcalli, rumored to be the throne’s favorite,” Lord Fanyana informed her, for once looking engaged. “He led the Izcalli forces in the Sordan War and by all appearances he is one of the finest military minds of our age – at the Battle of Narba he defeated three armies in a day.”

“And he is said not to be Izcalli by birth, only Aztlan,” Lady Emeni added. “Scandalous, yes?”

It was, given that the Atzlan realms around Izcalli were more likely to yield serfs than high-ranking generals when the Sunflower Lords got their say. The traditional round of sport was had at the expense of the Izcalli inability to build so much as a barn without having a round of civil war and emptying a Someshwari village. When the roast mutton, pumpkins and carrots were served – cattle being on the plate signaled this was the main service – conversation turned to the latest about everyone’s associations.

In other words, gossip.

“I hear that fallen noble from the Nineteenth, Barboza, got into a fistfight with a cabalist from the Twelfth,” Thando shared. “There was shouting about a bathtub.”

“Lierganen nobility,” one of the Emain twins noted. “Almost a lie.”

There was some laughter at that, and Angharad near smiled. The ladies Emain, while openly indifferent to the talk of politics, seemed much more interested in this sort of talk. Lord Zama, noticing her cup was empty, silently offered to fill it with maize beer again. It would have been rude to refuse, given his higher rank, so Angharad nodded. It was only her second cup, she still had room.

The Pereduri ladies then traded a few sentences in Gwynt between themselves, which had Thando leaning towards her.

“How well do you understand that?” he asked in a murmur.

“Not well,” she admitted. “The only word I caught was ‘mouse’, though it could also have been ‘thistle’.”

“Unfortunate,” he said. “I had hoped someone would finally understand their asides.”

Angharad hummed.

“A curiosity, if you would,” she said.

He cocked an eyebrow.

“Her brigade?” she asked, discreetly gesturing towards Lady Lindiwe.

His smile was knowing.

“Tenth Brigade,” he said. “Closely tied to the First.”

And the First, from what Angharad recalled, was foe to both the Ninth and the Third. Yet Lady Lindiwe had been quite cordial with Lord Awonke, who was actually of the Third, and that might mean the enmity there ran very shallow. So it might be possible to muster both of them for the same cause, Angharad thought. What she needed to find out was how likely that pair was to support Zenzele being invited purely to pull at Musa’s ear.

She drifted back into the conversation after nodding Thando her thanks, finding out that talk had turned to how that ‘Tupoc fellow from the Fourth’ had managed to get the captains of the Thirty-Sixth and Thirty-Eighth so frothingly angry that the latter had drawn a pistol on him right there in the Galleries. That prompted Angharad to share a few choice stories from the Dominion. Half the table shook with laughter when told them about his almost ending up in a cage, and booed how he called himself a defender of the weak when stepping in the way of an honor duel.

Sleeping God, the man had only been on the island a few weeks longer than her. How was he already this disliked?

By the time of the next service – dumplings and sour milk – she felt like she had a handle on the currents of the table. She sipped at her cup of beer, filled anew by Lord Zama even though she had barely touched it, and considered the levers she might pull at. The following service should be dessert, followed by a second round of mingling over drinks, which would let her try her hand at getting Zenzele his invitation. The only way for it was to gather enough supporters that Musa refusing would make him look worse than accepting, and the count for that was… troublesome.

The Emain twins were likely to sit it out, and Lord Zama unlikely to slight the man he was friendliest with. Lindiwe, Awonke and Emeni were a solid foundation if she could sway them. Thando would likely help, for a price, and Lord Kasigo would side with the victors. That meant the man she needed on her side, the hinge of it all, was Fanyana Khosa. That would be tricky to achieve, but Angharad found herself hiding a smile as she sipped at her beer.

It felt exciting, to be back here in this room. Doing what she had been raised to do, with people she understood. Another breath of fresh air.

Dessert was traditional, sweet corn pudding, and when Lord Zama again filled her cup with beer Angharad realized she had made what her father called the beginner’s mistake: being so taken with her own schemes she had failed to consider there might be others afoot. Maize beer was not a strong drink, but the kind served at feasts was stronger than the usual kind. She had not had enough to make her drunk, but enough to loosen her limbs some. And if she drained that cup, then the refreshments later? Then she would be.

So now she must consider another question: why was Lord Zama trying to get her drunk?

The easy guess was that Musa might try his hand at another challenge tonight and had decided to get the odds on his side, but that did not seem much like the man. While not exactly without wiles, Angharad thought Musa Shange would simply be too proud to claim a victory in this manner. There was something more to it. What did Musa want? With her, likely little. But his captain had charged him with courting Angharad for the Ninth.

That was the thread Angharad needed to follow to unwind this to the source.

Horse trading of gossip continued over the pudding, Angharad not touching her beer and digging in s quickly as was polite to fill her belly further. A shame, as she rather enjoyed the delicacy and would have preferred to savor it. What is the angle at work, she wondered, and how can I use it for my own purposes? What had her at a loss was that Musa hardly even glanced at her, more interested in table talk about the Forty-Fourth having run into blem and ran with the legs tucked between their legs, and did not seem to be moving to muster against her.

He was not pulling strings, or maneuvering. Was all this simply Lord Zama having a surfeit of hospitality? She had her answer when the last of the plates were cleared and the servants brought in small cups of distilled palm wine. A liquor on the stronger side. And Musa rose to his feet, smiling, to offer a toast.

“To our latest addition,” he said, raising a glass to Angharad.

The man was trying to get her drunk, no doubt about it. She could not refuse a toast to herself, so she matched him – as did most the table – and drank the palm wine. Only she used an old trick of her father’s refraining from swallowing. She then pretended to chase the strong liquor with maze beer, instead spitting out the liquor into that cup. Musa wanted to achieve something by getting her drunk, and so far her only hint was that two at the table had not drunk of the toast.

The first was facing her, so it was the natural choice.

“Do you not enjoy palm wine, Lord Kasigo?” she idly asked.

The fresh-faced man looked embarrassed.

“I was raised Serene Redeemer,” he replied. “I do not drink alcohol.”

He brow rose. To a Universalist with her all Redeemers were hardliners, but the so-called ‘Serries’ were one of the starker sects of the faith. Their claim to fame was a doctrine that the soul must be kept serene to be closer to the Sleeping God, emptied of earthly distractions. Like drink and music, most famously. So taken aback was she that a moment passed with her at a loss as to what to say, Kasigo stepping in.

“It is uncommon in noble households, I know,” he said, “and I imagine yours was quite different. Most Pereduri are Universalists, yes?”

And before Angharad could open her mouth, the second to abstain stepped in.

“Ah, Kasigo, I must stop you,” Lindiwe Sarru smiled. “You approach a mistake.”

The man shot her a surprised look.

“Do I?”

“Indeed,” she said. “Tredegar, you see, is not from a noble household.”

Dead silence followed, filling the room to burst. In it, Angharad could hear of a noose pulled tight.

“Pardon?” she evenly asked.

“Correct me if I speak untruly,” Lady Lindiwe said, tone pleasant for all the strong language, “but was House Tredegar not  struck from the rolls of nobility, its holdings placed in the care of the crown?”

Eyes cold, Angharad met her gaze. Lindiwe – no, Sarru now, the Pereduri owed her no further courtesies – was being quite obvious in seeking to force a duel.

“All titles are set aside when taking the black, Sarru,” she replied. “Is that untrue?”

She laughed.

“Must I explain to you,” Sarru said, “the difference between a title being set aside and stripped?”

“It seems it is I,” Angharad flatly replied, “who must explain to you the meaning of the word courtesy.”

“Manners are one thing, lies another,” Sarru said. “Everyone here joined the Watch while titled, and by this virtue warrant invitation to such a gathering. Everyone except you.”

She had two threads to pull: Musa’s captain wanted her in the Ninth and Lindiwe Sarru had not been drinking. Intending a duel from the start? Yes, she decided. Though giving great insult, the other woman was not speaking with particular venom or anger. She was simply speaking the words needed to get what she wanted.

And Angharad saw no way to slip out of the noose.

“Your words stain my honor,” she said. “Withdraw them.”

“No,” Sarru happily said.

Stiffly, the Pereduri rose to her feet.

“Blades, then.”

“First blood?” Sarru asked.

“Surrender,” Angharad coldly denied.

“A woman after my own heart,” she laughed, rising as well.

The rest of the table erupted, but more in excitement than outrage. The only to look miffed was Lord Fanyana, though more at the mess than the words. Angharad stepped aside servants were sent for to prepare the drawing room for a duel, ignoring Thando’s quiet words as she closed her eyes and tried to put it all together.

Musa would not want to help Sarru, who was friend to his own captain’s foe. So why had he asked Lord Zama to get her drinking? Even had she imbibed another round or two of palm wine she would not have been made incapable, only…

Sloppy.

Musa was not helping Sarru, he was harming Angharad. He must have figured out Sarry would press for a duel and wagered that with some drink in her she would make a mistake and gravely harm a member of the Tenth. Which would draw both the First and the Tenth down on her head, and that of any brigade she was part of. Ferranda would not be able to withstand such grand enmity, not when the Ninth was already at odds with her.

But Captain Sebastian Camaron could, and would no doubt extend his protection with a smile – should Angharad join the Ninth Brigade.

“What a snake,” she murmured. “I almost missed it.”

“Angharad?”

She opened her eyes, finding Thando Fanya frowning at her.

“The captain of the Ninth reaches into this room,” she said. “Perhaps he should be taught a lesson.”

“Dueling a friend to his foe will do no such thing,” Thando said.

“No,” she agreed. “That will have to come later.”

To their honor, none of the servants looked uneasy when told to prepare for live blades being bared. Nor should, they since nearly all of them were Malani. The only detail left to put together, Angharad thought, was why Sarru was so eager for a duel. She could not ever recall giving the woman offence. When offered a pin to steady her skirts by a woman in green livery, Angharad took it and slid it in after some adjustments.

Her stride would not be fully free and she disliked fighting in soft boots, but it was nothing crippling.

She handed her sheathed saber to the officiant – Lord Fanyana had been volunteered – and after Sarru did the same, she gave the noblewoman a cool glance. Her duelist’s straps had pulled her skirts, revealing fighting boots Angharad could only envy. There could be no doubt she had come with this in mind. The two of them stood there, no one else close enough to overhear, as their weapons were inspected.

“This all seems most unwarranted,” Angharad said.

“Does it?” Sarru mused.

“What have I ever done to earn your ire?”

Lindiwe Sarru’s smile was a cold thing.

“I tire, Tredegar, of hearing talk of butter,” she said. “Of the mirror-dancer among us, how she must be the finest Skiritai in our year. Praise after praise after praise.”

Her dark face tightened.

“Time to give them something else to talk about,” Sarru said.

She shot the other woman an incredulous look.

“Gossip is what this is all about?”

“If you do not grasp that in this school rumors are the only currency of status, then you are a very great fool indeed,” Sarru scorned.

Lord Fanyana returned their sabers, which was for the best. The only answers Angharad had it in her to give now would lead to this ending in a corpse. The center drawing room had been cleared of furniture, everything put up against the walls, and the great round carpet on the ground was designated the dueling. The rest of the guests kept to the sides as the two of them walked to the center of the carpet, Angharad’s stride angry.

She forced herself to smooth out her anger. Giving her opponent power over her mindset was the first step to defeat. They turned to face each other.

“Draw,” Lord Fanyana said.

Angharad slid out her blade.

“Begin.”

She pulled on her contract and-

Nothing? No, everything was there. Everything but the woman she was facing, who was missing from the glimpse entirely.

-the power of the contract withdrew, and now there was a triumphant grin on Lindiwe Sarru’s face.

“I knew it,” she quietly said. “Not your reflexes, but those of others. You can read how muscles will move, it’s how you always know how to kill the lemures.”

Angharad forced herself to put on a hint of dismay and bury her relief very, very deep.

“There will be none of that with me, though,” Sarru told her. “I’m a shadow, you see.”

And then it began.

Sarru was shorter than her, but the longer length of her blade would make up for it some. It will be either lightened or slow, Angharad as the other woman fell into a high guard. Best to learn which quickly, for it would inform her approach: she took a middle guard took, stepped forward and then to the side. Sarru moved to keep facing her, her stance seemingly easy to keep, and Angharad tried a feint – towards the chest, then sweeping down to the foreleg.

Sarru smoothly moved a step back but her blade did not so much as twitch. Slow, Angharad decided. She was limiting her movements to keep from committing to a mistake she would not be able to take back. Then victory lay in offence.

Angharad Tredegar breathed out and moved.

Quickstep, closing range, and a cut to the arm – Sarru parried, all crisp textbook clean, and the riposte went for her face. Snorting, Angharad slapped aside the blow and wove past her guard. She would have had her knee kicked out under her for it, if she’d not circled first. Sarru moved to match, Angharad feinted, forced her blade low to protect her knee, then pivoted again. The Malani struggled to keep up, half a beat behind, and Angharad kept up the pressure.

Blow to the neck, getting an awkwardly angled block, and she slammed the pommel of her saber on Sarru’s chest. She drew back with a pained groan, guard askew and Angharad saw the opening. The golden road. Draw back the blow, press the blade and then thrust her wrist: the base of her blade would come to rest against Sarru’s throat, death blow withheld.

Her hand moved, and then it all went to shit.

Lindiwe Sarru pressed back against her press, sweeping back with – she shouldn’t have been able to, the weight of her blade working against the strength of her wrist, but here we were – her own blow, Angharad ducking under what should have been victory and getting elbowed in the face. She rolled back, narrowly avoiding a blow that would have sliced up her flank deep, and smoothly rose in a high guard.

“Your saber’s not heavy at all,” Angharad said. “You were baiting me the entire time.”

“Candlesteel alloy,” Sarru smiled. “Meant for the slaying of spirits, but your blood will suffice.”

“Come and draw it, then,” she scorned. “Or is the only sharp edge on your tongue?”

A twitch of anger, and with nothing left to hide the Malani finally went on the offence. A feint that Angharad ignored, a blow she turned aside but she had good footing and a quick wrist: they both danced away rather than choosing to slice up each other’s cheek. Perhaps it was time to find out how Sarru dealt with saber locks, Angharad mused. The other woman was not slight, but the Pereduri would pit her arms against the other woman’s any day.

She tried not to think too deeply on how she was beginning to enjoy herself.

The noblewoman slid forward, stride smooth, and – and the door burst open. Angharad stilled halfway through a saber stroke. As did Sarru, though not so quickly she did not bring her blade to edge of Angharad’s guard. The rat.

It was a man, she saw, in Watch black. Regular’s uniform with cloak over it, and on his collar was pinned a golden braid. A commander’s mark, she had learned in Mandate. What is a commander doing he– and then the face sunk in. The short hair, the brown eyes and tall stature. The neatly trimmed beard with a hint of gray and the Tredegar nose.

“Uncle?” she croaked out.

Commander Osian Tredegar – he had been a captain, as far as she knew! – swept the room with his eyes and spared the situation what could only be called a deeply unimpressed look.

“Disgraceful,” he said. “This is Scholomance, not the royal court. Sheathe those blades before I have you both running laps around the harbor until the sweat leaves some room inside for common sense.”

She flinched back, lowering her blade. Sarru shot her a look, as if wondering whether this had been arranged.

“This is matter of honor, Commander,” she said, “it is not-”

“It is not the place of officer of the Watch to duel,” he calmly interrupted her. “It is, in fact, strictly against regulations.”

A thin smile.

“As you are still students this is not a breach, but it proof that you are still very much arrogant children,” Osian Tredegar said, then glanced at Angharad. “Sheathe that bloody sword, girl. I’ll not say it again.”

Feeling very much like she should be looking down at her boots, Angharad did. All the others had been silent, until Lord Fanyana cleared his throat.

“If I may ask for your name, sir?”

“Commander Osian Tredegar,” her uncle replied. “Umuthi Society, currently on assignment for the Obscure Committee.”

The handful of watchmen charged with overseeing Tolomontera? His words earned a ripple. The Emain twins were the only ones visibly unimpressed, trading sentences in Gwynt. Her uncle fixed them with a steady look.

“Oh, but I know who you are,” he said, baring his teeth. “Sticks with bad hair and noses up in the air? You must be Ceridwen’s daughters.”

A snort.

“She was a snobby brat as well,” Uncle Osian said. “There is a reason she was pushed into a pond on the night of her debut.”

Far from being offended, to Angharad’s horror the pair were now looking at him with almost starstruck expressions.

“No offence was meant, Commander,” the leftmost twin assured.

“Mere curiosity,” the other added.

“I’m sure,” he replied, rolling his eyes, then turned his gaze onto the rest. “Considering that my own niece was involved in this foolishness, I will turn a blind eye this once. I invited you, however, to ask your brigade patrons what participation in honor duels while serving a term in the Watch will do for your prospects.”

From his tone, it was nothing pleasant. Perhaps, if Angharad was very lucky, no one would think to mention during his stay that this was the second duel she was fighting in less than a month.

A vain hope, with Wen Duan around.

Part of her, she would admit, took delight in all these better born sorts shuffling awkwardly out of the drawing room like embarrassed children. Sarru was the last to leave, leaning in for parting words after sheathing her sword.

“This is not over,” she said.

“So close to a lie, Sarru,” Angharad chided.

She snarled as she pulled away, a servant closing the door behind her and leaving Angharad to stand alone with her uncle. Who was looking somewhat unimpressed with her.

“What made you think this was a good idea?” he asked.

 “My honor was impugned,” she stiffly replied. “What else should I have done?”

A long moment passed.

“Sleeping God, you sound like your mother,” he sighed. “Our father used to say she took to the sea because she’d picked all the fights there were to be had on land.”

Shaking his head fondly, Uncle Osian pulled her in tight and she leaned in eagerly. He was, she notice just not quite tall enough to rest his chin on her head. He made to withdraw after a moment but Angharad tightened her grasp, leaning her forehead against his shoulder, and he relented. It was a long while before they parted.

“Look at you,” he grinned, looking enchanted. “So tall now! When I last saw you, you did not even reach my chest.”

“I was only nine,” Angharad laughed.

And a lot more interested in her live steel lessons than her visiting uncle at first, although that’d changed when he began giving gifts. That Izcalli paperweight in the shape of a two-tailed snake had been her favorite, keeping a place of honor on her desk for years. Osian’s brown eyes took her in, scrutinizing.

“You’ve your mother’s nose and build,” he said, “but the rest is all your father’s, I’m afraid.”

She straightened in pride. Gwydion Tredegar’s good looks had made him the darling of Pereduri peerdom, once upon a time.

“Would that I had gotten his charm as well,” Angharad ruefully said. “I would end up in fewer duels.”

“Oh, I doubt that,” Osian snorted. “Malani lordlings are like tomcats – lock a couple of them in a room and some fur’ll always go flying. We have to train it out of them before the Watch can get a use of the virtues.”

He shrugged his shoulders.

“Besides, your mother saw to it you know you way around a blade, which I wager will serve you better in the long run than any amount of wiles.”

“It has helped me on Tolomontera,” Angharad admitted.

He beamed.

“I had a feeling you would do well here,” Osian said. “The Militants prize talent above all and they’ve the cleanest inner workings of any covenant.”

A thoughtful pause.

“It helps that most of their chief officers are complete lunatics,” he added.

“Are you sure you should be telling me this?” Angharad asked, half-serious.

“Nothing you won’t learn in Mandate eventually,” Osian dismissed, “though I expect they’ll coach it in nicer language. Still, enough about the Watch. How have you been? Are you enjoying your time with the Thirteenth?”

Ah. Angharad cleared her throat embarrassedly.

“I have been settling in,” she said. “I did not expect there to be quite so many scholarly classes, but I am keeping up with the work – still, I must confess that Warfare and my covenant classes remain my favorite.”

“I wish,” he said, sounding somewhat chagrined, “that your favoring the fighting pit full of monsters came as a surprise.”

She blinked in surprise. How strange, why would he? Still, she set that aside for the embarrassing part.

“As for the Thirteenth Brigade, we are to part ways,” Angharad said. “We have had differences too difficult to reconcile, so I will be transferring to the Thirty-First for at least a few months.”

Her uncle’s face clenched.

“I – you,” he said, then licked his lips. “I’m sorry to hear that, because it won’t be possible.”

The noblewoman frowned.

“I don’t understand,” she said.

“You must stay with the Thirteenth for at least the next few months,” he said.

She goggled at him.

“Why?”

“Because in three weeks you will be leaving for the Asphodel Rectorate as part of that brigade, heading out for your yearly test,” Osian said.

She almost laughed at the absurdity of the words, until she saw his face was dead serious.

“Uncle, I have not been on Tolomontera for a month,” Angharad said. “How could I possibly be ready for this test?”

“That has been taken into consideration, and you’ve been given an easier assignment because of it,” Osian said. “But the timetable cannot be moved, Angharad. I had to step on quite a few toes to get it changed.”

“Help me understand,” she quietly asked.

“The Thirteenth was picked for one of the Asphodel assignments when it was formed,” he said, “because the Rectorate is a quiet spot in our backyard. Unfortunately, the situation as changed.”

He grimaced.

“At the turn of the year, the Rectorate announced that it discovered an Antediluvian shipyard beneath the island,” Osian said. “Which would be bad enough, but there was also a massive imperial cache inside among which was the largest find of tomic alloys in a century.”

Angharad breathed out, parsing the implications. Great wealth, of course, but more importantly-

“They will be able make skimmers,” she said. “The old kind from the First Empire, not the smaller modern ones.”

“They already can,” Osian grimly said. “When the Rector revealed all this to the diplomatic envoys of every successor-state, he also showed them the first skimmer the shipyards made – no larger than a caravel, but my friends in the Deuteronomicon tell me the aetheric engine’s twice the size of anything the Tianxi can make.”

“And this brought enemies to their doorstep,” Angharad guessed.

“That’s one way to put it,” he snorted. “The Krypteia are predicting that within six months there will be civil war with foreign power involvement. Whoever gets their hands on those shipyards tips the balance of the Trebian Sea their way, Angharad – you must go now or you’ll be heading into bloody mayhem.”

“I would not have to go at all, if I were not part of the Thirteenth,” she carefully said.

He grimaced again.

“That is unfortunately untrue,” he said. “Your killing the Cerdan boy ensured the Obscure Committee won’t send you to Sacromonte and it’s been judged the odds are too high you’ll get assassinated if you’re sent to the Riven Coast – that house has friends among the pirate kings. Asphodel is the only destination in the cards for you.”

“Surely there are other brigades taking tests there,” she tried.

“Four will be sent,” Osian agreed.

“Then,” she hesitantly tried, “would it not be possible-”

“It’s too late, Angie,” he softly interrupted. “I burned most the favors owed me last year so I did not have the pull for this on my own. I had to get help from Colonel Zhuge.”

“I am unfamiliar with the name,” she admitted.

“He is the officer who recommended Song Ren,” her uncle said. “A well-respected Stripe with a command on the Rookery. I had to lean heavily on his connections. We made… arrangements, and they all involve your being part of the Thirteenth.”

A reluctant halt.

“I gave my word.”

Angharad bit her tongue, better to swallow the sharp words wriggling on them. It was a grave disrespect for Uncle Osian to make promises on her behalf, but she owed him debts greater than words could convey. She would have died a hundred times over, if not for his interventions.

“I have already told Song I intend to leave the Thirteenth,” she finally sighed.

“I cannot stop you from doing that,” Osian frankly said. “But if you do, Angie, the wheels come off the carriage. Colonel Zhuge pulls his support, almost certainly, and what follows will be… unpredictable. Messy.”

He rubbed the bridge of his nose, mind wandering.

“I’ll be pulled out of the trip, at least,” her uncle said. “Buried in a workshop for a few years even if I don’t get demoted. You’ll still be going to Asphodel, but if the patron and those who gave recommendations for the brigade you join get involved-”

Osian trailed off, frowning.

“You are sailing there as well?” Angharad asked.

He nodded.

“I’m part of the delegation negotiating for tomic materials and the designated Umuthi instructor besides,” Osian absent-mindedly said. “I’m to discreetly lend a hand to Song Ren on Asphodel using those appointments. Zhuge let me be the face for this whole deal so if it crumples it’ll be coming down on my head, but-”

“I’ll do it,” Angharad said.

Ancestors, how could she do anything less? After all he had done for her it would have been abominable to turn on him. His head swiveled her way.

“I could try to get you transferred to another of the brigades going,” he tried. “The colonel will get snippy, but I could still hold up my end of the bargain with him.”

“I don’t suppose the Thirty-First is one of them?” she asked, but it was half-hearted.

She would not wish this debacle on them, and if they were not involved she could not conceive of asking them to be. It would be a poor repayment of their kindness indeed to drag them into this. Osian shook his head.

“The Fourth, Eleventh and Forty-Ninth,” he said.

So Tupoc, Imani Langa or the band of fools after Tristan’s bounty. To think Song would be still be the finest pick of the lot. And then it hit her: Imani Langa. The bargain she had struck, the Infernal Forge for a letter to her father and aid freeing him. She could not get the damned thing if she was not on Tolomontera. Panic rose, but she fought it down. Imani was bound for Asphodel as well, she would have to understand.

Wouldn’t she? What if she didn’t?

Angharad dimly realized that was on a ship seaward bound, and the lights behind her were growing dreadfully distant.

# Chapter 35

It was barely six in the morning when Maryam got back to the cottage.

She’d been bundled off to the chapterhouse last night to sleep it off, against her protests. Just because her eyes had felt hot and she had slurred her words was no reason to have her slung over some watchman’s shoulder and carried to the Meadow. Or so she would have liked to say, but even when sleeping on grass surrounded by running water she’d had vivid nightmares about being strangled and eaten alive.

Captain Yue had ‘accidentally’ ordered her shaken awake at the crack of too early, then ‘apologized’ by making her breakfast over what was a very thinly veiled interrogation about how Maryam had managed a Sign the previous evening.

And Maryam had managed a Sign. Thalassic, no less. The giddiness she still felt at that had been enough for her to suffer the horrid rice porridge that Yue was under the impression served as an edifying breakfast. It had taken a veritable sea of tea to wash it down, but at least the Tianxi stocked the good stuff and she had deigned to dip into her personal reserves.

“I have a theory,” Captain Yue mused. “Consider yourself free for the evening, it will take me some time to gather the necessary materials.”

Maryam glared at her half-heartedly.

“The last time you said you had a theory, I nearly drowned.”

The knot keeping the stones tied to her ankles had been much too tightly made.

“And from that we learned the entity has a physical anchor on you,” Captain Yue happily said. “Isn’t that worth throwing up a little seawater?”

“Tell me I won’t drown this time,” Maryam demanded.

The Tianxi considered that for an uncomfortably long amount of time.

“Not on seawater, I don’t think,” Yue said.

“Not on any kind of water,” she insisted.

“There’s water in nearly everything, Maryam, don’t be difficult,” Captain Yue complained.

So Maryam had her afternoon free, though apparently it was not a feasting day so much as a last meal. Regardless, as she gave it good odds that Song would want to retrieve their affairs from the Ninth’s storehouse as quickly as possible, this was fortunate happenstance. Song thought so as well when the Ivzorica joined her for a spell in the kitchen.

“Tristan will be coming as well,” Song said. “He will need to pick up a shift at the Chimerical tomorrow to make up for it, but Hage appears to be flexible in such regards.”

The devil, Tristan often complained, was flexible in all manners save that of remuneration. He had apparently gone out of his way to find out the usual rates of Sacromontan day laborer so he could offer measurably below them. Song sipped at her tea, humming in pleasure. The Tianxi had offered a cup, but Maryam was already filled to burst with Yue’s own. Still, she grinned at the telling detail.

“Tristan now, is it?” Maryam said.

No longer Abrascal. She did not bother to hide her satisfaction, which saw Song rolling her eyes.

“We have come to something of an understanding,” Song replied. “I will not presume on its length or strength.”

There was a salty joke in there, but sadly the Tianxi was almost as boring as Tristan in that regard. It was a shame Tredegar had gone over to the Thirty-First, Shalini was always good for that kind of a laugh. Someshwari claimed to be the finest lovers in the world – though only their part of the Someshwar, of course, not those deluded others – so their humor tended to run more earthy than the Tianxi or Lierganen ever let themselves be when sober.

“You’re allowed to smirk, you know,” Maryam told her.

To her delighted surprise, Song flashed her a wicked smirk.

“You may applaud,” her captain said.

Lips twitching, Maryam offered her a few polite claps as the Tianxi took a theatrical bow. She had not seen Song so… loose since their early days on the Rookery, and even back then there had been something coiling beneath the humor. The last few days had knocked something loose inside the other woman and Maryam did not dislike it at all.

“Where is Tristan, anyhow?” she asked.

“Out in the garden,” Song replied. “He should be sowing the carrot seeds, by now. He began weeding before I woke.”

And Song was not a late riser.

“Tristan the farmer,” Maryam mused, pushing back her chair. “That I have to see.”

“Tell him to get the dirt out of his hair before Theology,” Song called out.

She had not even mentioned the knees this time. Song truly was in a good mood. Taking the front door out, Maryam swung around to the long length of earth and greenery leading up to the edge of the hollow their cottage was nestled in. Tristan was walking back and forth across a rectangle of cleared earth wearing a loose shirt and trousers, a bag tied to his belt as he tossed seeds by the handful.

Her throat caught at the sight. For a moment she was riding down the valley road, while in the distance farmers plowed the earth before sowing barley and millet. She could almost hear the cattle bells in the distance, smell the shit and mud. Swallowing drily, Maryam licked her lips. Fool girl, she told herself. It is more than just a sea away. Leave it in the grave where it belongs.

If there was anything left of the world she had known as a child, she would only find it beyond the Broken Gates. What was with her today? She’d not had that nightmare since leaving the lowlands either. Had the Sign shaken loose some memories of home? Forcing herself to breathe in, she reached for the comfort closest at hand.

“Are you not meant to plow the ground first?” she called out. “Already cutting corners, Abrascal.”

Tristan, who for once appeared not to have heard her coming – even odds Fortuna had been chattering in his ear – turned with a start of surprise. Then her words sunk in and he turned indignant.

“It is not necessary with carrots,” he called back, sounding defensive. “The seeds are small enough for broadcast.”

She grinned and closed in, for there was blood in the water. She stayed at the edge of the broad rectangle of beaten hearth he had delineated in deference to his efforts, though.

“Sowed a lot of carrots in Sacromonte, did you?” she drawled.

“I read it in a book,” Tristan sneered back. “Besides, who are you to give me advice? If you’ve so much as touched a plow in your life, I will eat the rest of this bag.”

He shook the plump length of cloth, which was at least half full. Amusing as the thought of force-feeding him like goose might be the thief was, uh, not entirely incorrect. Had Maryam ever touched a plow? There were the yearly land ceremonies, but her older siblings had always done the symbolic plowing of the spring ground.

“My family lived on trade,” she finally defended. “Not fields.”

“And yet you meddle in my affairs,” he scornfully replied. “As usual, the humble farmhand – backbone of this country, and indeed of all countries-”

“Did you pay for that book?” Maryam challenged.

“I don’t have to answer that,” Tristan immediately said.

“The speech wouldn’t work as well if started with ‘the humble thief’, huh,” Maryam said.

He looked away, but not before she caught the corner of a grin on his face. To what would be Song’s relief there was no dirt in his hair, though he must have done the weeding on his knees before getting to sowing. The nape of his neck shone with sweat, though. It was appealing, in a rough tumble sort of way. Also very unlike him, as Tristan was a city man to the bone.

“You’re going to smell like sweat all morning if you don’t wash,” Maryam said.

The gray-eyed man rolled his shoulder.

“That was rather the point,” he admitted.

She cocked her head to the side.

“I thought Song had finally squeaked into your good side.”

“It is not about her,” Tristan dismissed. “I took drugs last night and aim to sweat them out. Field work is as good a means as any.”

Her brow rose.

“Was the mixture so dangerous?”

“There was poppy inside,” he said.

“I have seen you take poppy before,” Maryam pointed out. “Everybody uses it – my mentor once told me the Navigators have yet to encounter a land where it is not used.”

“That does not make it any less dangerous,” Tristan flatly replied. “Out in the Murk, they sell poppy in small dried sticks – clavos, they’re called. Nails. Because to shred and smoke one is to put a nail in your coffin.”

He grimaced.

“Poppy sinks its claws in you, Maryam, like few other things.”

For all that Song half-seriously made digs at his cleanliness, Tristan was perhaps the man neatest in his personal habits the Izvorica had ever met. No drink or drugs, he held gambling in distaste and disapproved of being spendthrift. That had her willing to wave away his words as a continuation of his habits, but there was something about his face… A tightness around the eyes, a half-clenched haw.

Tristan was not weaving guesses, he was talking from experience. And whatever that experience was, it troubled him still.

“I will take it I must, but I have seen the coffins of too many who used it nailed all the way shut to ever be pleased about that. The sooner I am rid of the dregs in my body, the better.”

Slowly she nodded. It must have been someone he knew, Maryam decided. It was wise advice besides, even beyond the poppy.  Some ceremonies of the Ninefold Nine involved drinking ergot wine or consuming vision mushrooms, and it was known certain practitioners took to their use a little too strongly – often they went mad, shattering their minds. A disease of the will, her mother had called it.

The thief leaned back, reaching for the small brass chain protruding from his pocket to fish out Vanesa’s watch.

“It is running late,” Tristan said. “I should stop and wash up.”

Absently nodding, Maryam’s gaze flicked to the side. There had been movement. Wind in the trees? No, higher up. On the roof, nestled close to the stargazing tower, she saw another twitch of movement. A bird, she realized. Large and black-feathered with streaks of white on its side and back. A heartbeat later it was gone, hiding in a tuck of the rooftop. How charming! She would have to look into the species. Maryam had always liked feeding birds.

“Maryam?”

She shook her head, turned to face her friend.

“I didn’t catch that,” she said.

“Have you thought about you’ll do with your cut?”

She cocked her head to the side.

“My cut of what?”

Tristan grinned broadly.

“Ah, Song hasn’t told you yet,” he said. “Clever woman that she is, she pocketed part of the bounty payout before the rest was seized by the Watch. The third they promised her.”

Now that was glad news indeed. So long as no one thought to ask them to cough it back up, anyway.

“How much?” Maryam asked.

A second hooded cloak was in order, and perhaps a proper throwing axe. The hatchets in the Watch armories were well balanced but not made for that purpose.

“It’s better when you see it from the black,” Tristan mused. “Come on, Khaimov, I’m about to make your day.”

—

Professor Artigas was a skilled speaker and her subject matter hardly uninteresting – aether, both its properties as a substance and the realm from which it flowed – but Angharad found her attention waning again and again.

Her sleep had been restless, drifting in and out for hours at a time, and staring at the ceiling had done nothing to abate her fears. She must speak with Imani Langa, and urgently. Only the ufudu had answers for her. Surely Imani would realize that the departure for Asphodel changed things. It was a mercy when class ended, freeing Angharad from the guilt of being a poor student.

Ancestors, Scholomance demanded so many readings. At least Marshal de la Tavarin seemed to remember what watchmen were supposed to be for. Rong was almost vibrating with excitement when Professor Artigas dismissed them, only a warning look from Ferranda preventing them from asking for an introduction to Uncle Osian.

Mentioning her uncle’s arrival at breakfast had so energized Rong Ma they had barely touched their bowl, instead asking question after question – few of which Angharad had answers for, her uncle having been all but estranged from House Tredegar as she grew up. She was going to have to find out what a fire ship was, and if it was true her uncle had sailed one into the Hull-Breaker’s maw. Perhaps Rong would save her the trouble of asking, even. Angharad had offered an introduction, some time back, and would deliver it. But not today.

She was not yet ready to look Osian Tredegar in the eye.

Ferranda lingered behind after the others packed away their affairs, the fair-haired infanzona turning a steady look on her. Angharad straightened. Ferranda Villazur’s face was on the plain side, but it was well suited to conveying severity.

“Something happened last night,” Ferranda said, which was not a question. “Should I be concerned?”

Angharad paused a moment, choosing her words before she answered.

“My uncle has made arrangements that run contrary to my intentions,” she admitted. “I must look into them further, but it may be I cannot join the Thirty-First at the end of the month.”

Ferranda’s eyes were searching as sought something on Angharad’s face. After a moment she nodded.

“Keep me informed,” she said, then after hesitating continued. “Do you need help?”

I may have mere weeks to accomplish what should have been the labor of a whole year, Angharad thought. Help is too feeble a word for what I need.

“I am not yet certain,” she replied instead.

Ferranda pressed no further. Angharad’s gaze slid away from her, towards another table. The Thirteenth Brigade looked exhausted, but also in a fine mood. Song smiled at something Maryam said, while Tristan rolled his eyes at them both. She felt a pang at the sight. It had been freeing, to leave the cottage behind, like having the wind at her back.

Now it looked like it was no longer her the wind favored.

“Rumor goes they were involved in a skirmish last night,” Ferranda quietly said. “Something down at the port that involved the Forty-Ninth.”

The same Forty-Ninth that had been noticeable absent in class today. Angharad had not told the infanzona of the bounty on Tristan’s head, those who would collect it, as it was not her secret to share. The enmity between the Thirteenth and the Forty-Ninth, however, was common knowledge – if not the reasons for it.

“It seems to have ended well for them,” Angharad said.

She was glad. To turn on a fellow student for something as petty as coin was without honor, and the Forty-Ninth had pursued that black mark most eagerly.

“Song’s the kind of woman who lands on her feet,” Ferranda noted. “She would never have made it to Scholomance otherwise.”

That was not untrue. And yet. Song calls herself captain yet keeps secret a curse that could harm all under her command, Angharad countered in her thoughts. The Pereduri was not so two-faced as to blame another for keeping secrets, but her own were not a literal curse that might spread to others around her. One all members of the Thirteenth save her had known about, once more proving her the sole fool under the roof.

Well, at least Tristan seemed to have learned of it on his own. Angharad could hardly take offense to a Mask digging up secrets.

“She is one of those I must speak with,” Angharad admitted. “Her uncle and mine struck a bargain.”

“Ah,” Ferranda murmured. “That kind of arrangement.”

She did not answer, leaving the infanzona to read into her words however she wished. The Thirteenth turned at her approach – Maryam’s face hardening, Tristan’s hand disappearing under the table – but she was greeted with polite enough nods, if little enthusiasm. She returned them stiffly.

“Song,” Angharad said after. “I require a word with you.”

The Tianxi narrowed silver eyes at her.

“What about?”

Angharad frowned at her, wondering if the other woman was playing the fool or simply had not yet heard from her patron. If Colonel Zhuge had not come to Tolomontera himself, she supposed the matter might have been entrusted to a letter instead.

“Matters best not spoken of in the open,” she finally said. “Would a table at the Emerald Vaults this evening suit?”

“I have other commitments,” Song evenly replied. “Tomorrow evening, however, does suit.”

Angharad nodded, parting after agreeing to discuss the particulars of the hours tomorrow at Warfare. The rest of the Thirty-First had gone on ahead, but Angharad walked to the front gates with Ferranda for company – though she was in no mood for small talk, which the other woman sensed and respected. Ferranda Villazur was not someone afraid of silences, befitting her skill as a huntress.

Angharad made her excuses when they were out on the plaza, mentioning she was to look for Salvador. Which was true, because her fellow Skiritai should be able to lead her to whom she truly needed: his captain, Imani Langa.

The Sacromontan often waited for her out in the plaza so that the two of them – and sometimes Shalini – might head to the Acallar together. Today proved to be no exception, the taciturn man seated on the bench by the statue of some ancient Sologuer royal – only he was not alone. Imani Langa stood beside him in a tailored regular’s uniform, speaking quietly as Salvador nodded. Both their heads rose at her approach.

“Ah, Angharad,” Imani smiled. “Just the woman I was looking for.”

“Imani,” she evenly replied, stomach squeezing tight. “Salvador.”

The Sacromontan nodded back, then rose to his feet. He shot a look at Imani, whose face remained a pleasant mask, then offered Angharad a nod goodbye before turning a clean pair of heels on them. They waited until he was well gone to speak again.

“Sit with me, Angharad,” Imani said, lowering herself onto the bench.

“Standing will serve.”

“Sit with me,” Imani repeated, “and smile. So that we do not draw attention.”

Begrudgingly, Angharad did – making sure to keep some distance between them.

“My uncle arrived last night,” she said.

“I heard,” Imani idly replied. “And the Thirteenth is headed for Asphodel soon.”

“As are you,” Angharad said.

“And the Fourth,” she agreed. “But no longer the Forty-Ninth, I hear. They are to be disbanded. I believe the Nineteenth is next line for that assignment.”

The Pereduri frowned, trying to recall the time she had spoken with the Nineteenth’s leader. Captain Tozi, had it been? The woman with that very Izcalli haircut.

“I do not know the details,” Angharad said, “but we will be away from Tolomontera for months.”

“We?” Imani lightly said. “I believed you set on transferring to the Thirty-First.”

“Things have changed,” she said. “My uncle made arrangements. I will be heading to Asphodel.”

Imani leaned back against the bench.

“Smile, Angharad,” she said. “As if engaged in flirtation with a pretty girl, not looking for an excuse to draw on me.”

The noblewoman breathed in, forced herself to calm. Only then did Imani continue.

“A bold choice,” Imani said, “but yours to make. Still, it seems to me a mistake to put off your labor until the last months of the year. When the other cabals are gone on assignment, many more eyes will be on you.”

Ancestors, that had not even occurred to her. If all the others left around the same time there would be what, at most twenty-eight students left on Tolomontera? As Imani was hinting, it would be devil’s work to get around unseen. And I will need a Navigator’s help, most likely. How many will even be there to request aid from? Neither Tupoc’s second nor Maryam would be eager to lend her a hand, if they even could.

“I need more time,” Angharad said. “I leave in mere weeks, and if what you say is true about the end of the year-”

“Then transfer,” Imani replied.

“There would be consequences,” Angharad told her. “For my uncle.”

“That tends to be the way, when choices are made,” Imani replied. “You have until the end of the year, Angharad. That will not change.”

She grit her teeth.

“Do you not understand-”

“It is you who does not understand,” Imani Langa coldly interrupted. “You were offered a bargain and took it. Now it becomes obvious to you that your decision has costs, and you are balking. This not a tragedy, it is a tantrum.”

“Am I to see my uncle buried and demoted for your sake, then?” Angharad hissed.

“For the sake of obtaining the help of the Lefthand House,” Imani corrected. “Unless you believe you can reach beyond the walls of Tintavel without us. A fortress that none ever escaped from.”

“Prince Wandile did,” Angharad pettily replied. “After his father sent him there to die.”

So the text of The Madness of King Issay went. The King of Hell himself spirited him out after Wandile swore to rise in rebellion against his father, setting blood against blood and thus sowing the seeds of their great kingdom’s fall. Some argued that part of the tale to be an allegory for taking bad council, and Mother had been firmly of that opinion, but Angharad would not lose the opportunity to correct Imani on an almost-lie if she had it.

“Save for one ancient prince, should one believe that part of the tale literal,” Imani dismissed with a roll of her eyes. “Do you believe your situation improved by the correction?”

“It was not worsened,” Angharad replied, the squared her jaw. “I will not harm my own kin for the promises the Lefthand House dangles ahead of me, Imani.”

She was not so much of a fool that she would be unaware the ufudu might just be intending to play her and cut her loose afterwards. What recourse would she have if they did?

“And should your father die in a cold, dark Tintavel cell would that count as harm?” Imani mildly asked.

Angharad’s jaw clenched. She forced herself not to reach for her blade.

“Do not push me too far, ufudu,” she said.

“Then do not waste my time,” Imani replied. “It is too late to back out now, Angharad. Simply accepting my offer you became complicit in the eyes of the Watch.”

“I could turn you in regardless,” Angharad said.

“You could,” Imani agreed. “At which point I will surrender, be made prisoner and kept in a cell until the Lefthand House trades me for a captured Krypteia agent. You, on the other hand, will be added to the list of those to hunted on sight in Malan – and the House of Tredegar will crumble to dust while your father rots in a cell.”

The ufudu rose to her feet.

“The end of the year, Angharad,” she repeated. “There will be no delay.”

A smile, as empty as the others before it.

“Still, I recognize there have been changes in your circumstance. Accordingly, I offer you aid.”

Reaching in her pocket, Imani took out a folded piece of paper and presented it. Angharad, grimacing, took it up.

“What is this?” she asked, not opening it yet.

“A map,” Imani said. “Your cabalist, Abrascal – he disappeared when fighting the Forty-Ninth and reappeared on the other side of a red line. There is only one way to easily explain that.”

“He fell into the layer,” Angharad quietly confirmed.

“The map leads to the house said fighting collapsed,” Imani said. “A good start, I think, for your search.”

And with her piece spoken, she left. Angharad stayed on the bench as the other woman walked away, ignoring her goodbyes as she stared down at the folded piece of paper in her hands. No matter how much she thought about it, how much she turned the pieces around looking for different angles, there was only one way to end this without betraying either her uncle or her father.

She needed to obtain the Infernal Forge before the ships left for Asphodel.

—

Song had not meant to stay long in the Galleries.

She was returning a book she’d borrowed from the private library, but had decided on a whim to rise to the uppermost level to have a look at the bounties. The Thirteenth had not yet done this week’s, though she was inclined to take one of the easy ones like on the previous week. The Warfare teachers had a recurring bounty to sweep their training fields for lemure nests, which earned only a pittance but could be knocked out in about an hour.

There were four such training fields, one for each contingent, and the bounty was always put back up within two days of being cleared: there was almost always one up for grabs.

With no Academy class this afternoon the lounge was nearly empty – only four other Stripes, seated around a table. Two she was acquainted with, Captain Anaya of the Twenty-Third and Captain Philani of the Thirty-Eighth, but she barely knew the others in passing. It made their staring all the more unexpected. Had word of the skirmish with the Forty-Ninth already spread? Song had expected the garrison to keep a tight lid on it for the first few days.

It was an egg on its face that a ship aiming to traffic a Watch student had been allowed to remain docked for such feeble reasons.

A glance at the bar told her that the usual servant was gone, replaced by Colonel Cao herself. The Stripe instructor stood behind the counter with a bottle and cup, writing into a slender manuscript. It was usually best not to disturb her without reason, so Song averted her gaze quickly. Ignoring the lingering stares from the others, she headed to the bounty board and skimmed through the contents.

Another of the Skiritai hunting bounties was gone, and more interestingly one of Tinker ones. Someone was being bold. Retrieving old materials from ruins out in the northwest paid very well on success, but also risked returning with nothing while a lemure attack was a near certainty.

A Warfare patrol was back up, as expected, and Song was unsurprised it had not been taken. It was the sweep for the field of the red ribbons, which was deeper in the grounds Scholomance and through a small thicket of trees. Not only did it take longer to sweep through, this one had the occasional lemure waiting in ambush.

That was enough to make her reconsider: Song’s arm was near enough healed, but after last night she was willing to set aside excitement for a time.

As she stood there wondering if she should instead grab one of the garrison patrols – never too long, but it was a spin of the wheel where or when you ended up on top of earning only ten coppers a head – she heard footsteps approaching. She angled herself to get a glimpse and found it was Captain Anaya. The Someshwari was a scowler by habit, but had a smile painted on when she came. Interesting.

“Captain Song.”

A hand offered, and taken.

“Captain Anaya,” she replied, shaking it briskly. “What can I do for you?”

The grip released.

“I only came to offer my congratulations,” Captain Anaya said.

Song cocked an eyebrow.

“What on?”

Theology this morning had not led her to believe word was out about the Forty-Ninth yet, despite their absence earning the Thirteenth many questioning looks, so best learn what rumor going around. Only the Someshwari cocked an eyebrow, nodding jerkily at the counter behind them. No, Song realized as she looked there. Not the counter but the slate with the scores.  Two dozen names were on it now, those leading the pack, but the topmost had changed since yesterday.

SONG REN – 23

It took every ounce of her self-control not to show a reaction. Hand on the chisel.

“Ah,” she said. “That.”

Below her the expected names had not changed. Vivek Lahiri at six and Sebastian Camaron at five. Yesterday, Song had been in sixth place with Nenetl Chapul having beaten her to four points and two other captains catching up to her score of three. She had, overnight, gained almost four times the score of the now runner-up.

“Any truth to the rumors of the Thirteenth’s involvement with the dust-up by the docks?” Captain Anaya idly asked.

A fishing expedition, then.

“That would be for the garrison to announce,” Song replied.

Other captain’s brow rose. It was not a denial, which was good as confirmation, but also a warning against further questions. Song stepped forward, taking one of the patrol bounties – she must, now that she knew about the score – and nodded at Anaya.

“Always a pleasure.”

“As you say,” Captain Anaya agreed.

The Galleries staff needed to be informed when most bounties were taken, so that word could then be passed onto those who had put them up. In this particular case, so the garrison could decide when tomorrow the Thirteenth would be slotted into its patrol schedule.

Since there was only one such person here, she now had an excuse to go to Colonel Cao.

She slid into a seat facing the other Tianxi, waiting for the colonel to finish tracing her characters. Chunhua Cao looked up after a moment, seemingly unsurprised by Song’s presence.

“Bounty?” she asked.

Song presented her with the patrol sheet. The colonel took it, reached for a ledger under the counter and dragged it up before cracking open. She made a quick note inside.

“Word will be passed to Captain Wen by seven about the schedule,” she said. “Make sure to consult him.”

“I will,” Song said, then swallowed. “Ma’am, if I may ask.”

“May you?” Colonel Cao drily replied. “Well, give it a shot.”

“My score,” Song said.

“You were told on your first day here that I would dock and award points as I see fit,” the colonel said.

Depending on whether you can impress or appall me, Colonel Cao had said.

“So the points are for last night,” Song said.

Colonel Cao drummed her fingers against the countertop.

“You broke up a trafficking ring that had set up shop under the garrison’s nose, and more importantly you did so while leaving survivors to interrogate and thus provide actionable proof,” the colonel said.

“I did not do it for score,” Song honestly said.

“No,” the colonel said, “you did it to keep your cabal from exploding in your face. But that doesn’t matter, Ren, because at the end of the day what you did was good for the Watch.”

She smiled thinly.

“That’s why you get twenty points instead of five,” Colonel Cao said. “Because you cleaned up our guts a little, contributed to the health of order, and that’s worth more than a dozen bounties.”

She poured herself another cup.

“You did good,” Chunhua Cao said. “I had my doubts when they told me one of the Ren would be in our first batch, but you haven’t cracked under the pressure – on the contrary, you seem to be rising to the challenge.”

Song swallowed.

“Thank you,” she made herself say.

“Don’t thank me, girl,” the colonel snorted. “I won’t pick you up if you stumble. That would rather defeat the purpose of this class.”

She sipped at her liquor.

“I saw you’ve been looking into Asphodel histories,” Colonel Cao said.

At Wen’s recommendation, given that their test would be on that very island. Which she suspected Chunhua Cao would know.

“Fascinating reading,” Song replied, perhaps less than honestly.

“For a Laurel, maybe,” Colonel Cao snorted. “It was a sound notion, but I recommend you grab another two books on your way out of the Galleries.”

The older woman flipped over the bounty sheet and quickly wrote out two titles in Cathayan. Trade in the Trebian, Ninth Sails Edition and Balancing Acts. She only added an author to the second, ‘Inez Espinoza’.

“You’ll find the trade logs in the records section,” she said. “It’s an Arthashastra count of estimated volumes and goods traded within the Trebian Sea, and between whom, for the last decade of the Century of Sails.”

That sounded most intriguing, in truth. Song cleared her throat.

“And the other?”

“Inez Espinoza is probably the finest political mind ever produced by Old Saraya,” Colonal Cao said. “She wrote Balancing Acts after spending twenty years as first regent then right hand to her nephew, so her examination of the balance of power in the Trebian Sea is sharp enough to cut.”

Lips twitched.

“It’s also quite disparaging to the Watch, which does not make it any less accurate.”

“I was under the impression,” Song slowly said, “that Asphodel is well on its to becoming a backwater. Of little import to anyone but their old Raseni rivals.”

“We live in interesting times, Ren,” Chunhua Cao smiled, and it was not a pleasant smile. “Not kind or good, but interesting indeed.”

She blew on the ink, closed the ledger from earlier and put it away.

“It is only a recommendation,” the colonel said. “Do as you will.”

Song took that for the dismissal it was. She picked up the books on her way out, but all the while a question dug away at her mind. Wen had recommended she read up on Asphodel in preparation of the distant yearly test, so why did Colonel Cao now seemed convinced that Song would need to borrow the books today?

—

Captain Wen Duan was like a truffle hound for small, delicious eateries. By the time their time in Scholomance ended, Tristan firmly believed that the Thirteenth was going to have hunted him down through all the best food shops in Port Allazei. The large man bit into his egg tart, scarfing it down with an indecent noise. He then remembered he was meant to be scorning them.

“What am I, your clerk?” Captain Wen complained.

Wen Duan always complained, Tristan had learned. The trick was in reading the undertone of the complaint. The signs were there if you looked for them. The overweight Tianxi was eating, which was not unusual, but he was swallowing before replying – which he did not usually bother with when he was out to anger you. Wen was always messiest when going for the throat.

Some of the things Tristan had seen that man do to churros should be banned under the Iscariot Accords.

“I would not dare make that claim,” Song serenely replied. “I will divest you of the letter immediately, if you’ll allow.”

He squinted at her through his spectacles, as if inspecting the words for something to take offense at and failing to find fault. Tristan made sure not to look too closely at the man, as the way he was dwarfed the small bakery’s sole table might have set his lips to twitch.  He was twice the size of it, and must have struggled to squeeze himself into the corner.

“Letters, actually,” Wen grunted.

He inhaled the rest of the egg tart, chewing enthusiastically.

“Colonels all around, Ren,” he added. “The garrison sent the patrol schedule, but you also have a letter from the Rookery.”

The second sign Wen was in a good mood, Tristan noted, was that though complaining to them about something they were in no way responsible he was not actually obstructing them. He was volunteering relevant information, and soon slid the pair of letters across the table for Song to take. Tristan filed away that Song’s great-uncle, whose rank she had kept vague, was a colonel at the Rookery.

That was no small connection. Professor Iyengar had taught them colonel was the highest rank most careerists could aspire to. In the Garrison only three ranks stood above it – lieutenant-general, brigadier and marshal – while in the free companies there were only two. Arguably only one, even, as being a warrant captain was the same thing as being the captain-general of a free company only with a command either too small or too recent to deserve representation on the Conclave.

All that and being a colonel not on some forlorn spit of rock but the Rookery itself, the heart of the Watch, meant that Song’s patron was no one to trifle with.  The Conclave only held session twice a year, but a colonel would be on the island-fortress all year long. There was a great deal of influence to be had there, if you were halfway clever.

He doubted Song would so blatantly look up to a fool, so he would err on the side of cleverness.

“Thank you,” Song politely replied, claiming the letters.

She tucked away the one with the formal correspondence seal, instead opening the simple folded paper from the Stripe instructor. Her brow rose, but her expression was pleased. He made an inquiring noise.

“We have Templeward east to west, beginning at six tomorrow,” she said.

Well now, Tristan thought.

“That’s not a chore your instructor assigned you, it’s a victory strut,” he said.

“Chunhua Cao doesn’t pick the patrol schedules,” Wen corrected. “Giving you a plum like that is the garrison sending a message.”

He disappeared another tart. Tristan eyed his rounded belly, wondering how there could be room for so much spite in there with the meals he ate. After a too-loud swallow, Wen cleared his throat.

“It would have been a bad look for them if the ship got away with Tristan, so you’re in good odor with the officers at the moment,” the bespectacled man said. “Enough so, even, that no one’s thought to ask if the six rolls of gold collected were all there was to the bounty.”

Song stilled.

“Six?”

Wen frowned at her.

“Six,” he repeated.

“Then someone helped themselves to one,” she said.

It was, Tristan thought, very flattering that someone had effectively been willing to sink the equivalent of five hundred ramas into having him abducted. If you counted everything Tristan had ever owned in his entire life, it would not warrant even a third of that sum. The expense was so flattering the thief had decided he would take the time to acquire a particularly nasty poison to feed this mysterious individual as a way of expressing regard.

“It won’t be a garrison man,” Wen mused. “If one gets caught helping themselves in a mess like this, they’d be whipped out of the ranks.”

“Then it must have been someone from the Fourth,” Song said, then looked like she had swallowed a lemon. “Tupoc Xical ran for the ship with me, it cannot be him.”

Wen shrugged.

“Not worth pursuing then,” he said. “The Fourth earned the right to wet their beak a bit, getting involved on the right side. Their name’s not on as many lips, but on lips they are.”

The rat could only admire Xical’s unerring ability to always end up having the right enemies at the right time. It helped the man made so many of them, no doubt. Maryam cleared her throat.

“There was another cabal out that night,” she reminded Wen. “Might I ask what they earned?”

That earned his attention well enough.

“That’s still up in the air,” the large man replied. “The Forty-Ninth is dissolved, that much is certain, but I hear the punishments are being hotly debated.”

He leaned back against the wall.

“Most of the time, selling out one of our own earns you the short drop and sudden stop,” he said. “But Tolomontera has only three rules, by design, and none of them forbid this. So there are some calls for leniency.”

Tristan’s stomach clenched. Song had recounted Muchen He and Captain Ramona being crippled, but with Lady Knot around that only meant so much.

“How much leniency?” he asked.

Wen shot him a look that was almost reassuring. It was a distressing sight.

“Not that much,” he said. “The Ramona girl and Tengfei Pan, they had dealings with outsiders to sell you. They get handed fourteen-year contracts in a Desolation free company, and if they live through it their record is expunged.”

Tristan winced. He had little sympathy for any in the Forty-Ninth, but the Desolation was a living nightmare – endless plains of ash and dust prowled by mad gods and monsters that grew as large as mountains. The constant need to man that border was, many agreed, the leading reason the Imperial Someshwar had failed to swallow up its smaller neighbors before they coalesced into successor-states too large to easily overwhelm.

“It’s the other three that are being shouted about,” Wen continued. “They were part of the deal, but did not strike it. There’s been arguments for them being expelled, but as usual this brigade trips itself up.”

The three of them traded puzzled looks.

“How, exactly?” Tristan frowned.

The fat man looked thoroughly amused.

“The fellow cabalists of the students who tried to murder Song were not expelled, which some are calling the precedent to follow here.”

“The fault of those students was ignorance, not anything else,” Song objected.

“And what is that, save a different degree of complicity?” he shrugged. “Or so the argument goes. The other side’s pushing for them to be expelled.”

“And if you had to pick a horse,” Tristan leadingly said.

“They’ll get a mark on their record and a slap on the wrist,” Wen bluntly said. “The Desolation sentence, it’s not just a harsh punishment – it’s a way to bury this. They can’t justify the same or a hanging for those three, and if they’re expelled their patrons are sure to lodge protests with the Obscure Committee.”

“Which means the harbor irregularities around the Palmyran would be dredged up in the investigation,” Song said.

Ah, Tristan thought. Someone was covering their ass.

“Which then means someone pretty high up in the Tolomontera food chain would get demoted,” Wen agreed. “If they give the leftovers a second chance with a mark on their record, they cover themselves going forward – either the idiots bother you again and now there’s rope to hang them with, or they avoid you like the plague and the career of promising students was salvaged.”

Good enough, Tristan mused. The garrison was using him as bait, but it was also ridding him of the worst of his enemies and backing him in a broader sense. This must be what it felt like, to live in the Old Town and have the Guardia on your side – unless it burned their fingers, anyhow, but that was just the way of the world. How odd, to have the guns on your side, but not at all unplea-

“For the garrison to use him as bait is unjust,” Song bit out. “It is failing in their duty of care over a student twice over, and-”

“And you should make your peace with it,” Wen advised, “because kicking up a fuss is going to make those same officers now patting you on the back lose that friendliness in the blink of an eye.”

Her interruption had been so unexpected – and almost absurd – that it’d taken a while for Tristan to push down the surprise. This was a dead-end road, though, so now he spoke up.

“Song,” Tristan said, and when she turned he shook his head.

No one made demands of the Guardia save the nobles who owned them, and trying was a good way to get your legs broken. Better to take the pat on the back than push their luck and have it replaced by a knife. Song’s lips thinned, but after a moment she nodded.

That she seemed genuinely angry on his behalf was… well, something.

“Thank you for your advice, Captain Wen,” she stiffly said.

Wen eyed her for a moment, then sighed.

“Pick your battles, Song,” he said. “There’s a satisfaction to shouting down into the well, but it’s no replacement for a bucket.”

“Is that how you ended up on the Dominion?” Tristan asked. “Shouting into a well?”

Wen snorted.

“I guess you could say the well shouted back,” he said. “And that’s all you get from me, rat.”

He picked up another tart.

“Now off you with you lot,” he said. “I have an important social call to make.”

“Hungry for some turron?” Song idly said.

Wen glared at her through his golden spectacles. It seemed an innocent question, but by that reaction must have been anything but.

“Khaimov, you are fast become my favorite of this sorry lot,” he replied.

“You are my favorite captain as well, sir,” Maryam assured him.

A pause.

“Although Yue almost drowned me, so it’s more coronation than contest.”

“Fucking Hell, it’s Mandy all over again,” Wen muttered. “Out, before I volunteer you three to clean the barrack latrines.”

It did not sound like an empty threat, so retreat was wisely agreed on. They hastened onto the street, close enough to the docks to hear the waves lapping at the shore, and Tristan looked up at the Orrery lights. It was getting late. Maryam saw the same thing.

“If we want to be back at a decent hour, we should head out soon,” she said.

“Let’s,” Song agreed. “It is a business long overdue.”

—

It was not a long walk to their destination: a house on Septim street, to the east of the large workshop the Umuthi Society had built for their students.

They used those tall arched windows to orient themselves, made easy by the colored lights that shone out of them. Sometimes the glass panes trembled, and there was smoke enough pouring out the workshop chimneys it looked like the Tinkers had imported a slice of Hell. Despite its proximity to the eastern end of Templeward, the neighborhood was not all that frequented a part of Allazei – mostly, Tristan would guess, because there were more warehouses than homes around here. Song agreed when he shared the thought.

“I expect there must have once been a gate connecting the docks to here,” she said. “Only the Watch wants from Allazei a fortress, not a trade port, so I expect it was walled in.”

“The garrison uses warehouses north of the barracks,” Maryam shared. “It would explain why they do not care about these falling part.”

Song had mentioned a green roof and a basement, and though the former was not that uncommon Septim Street only had one green-roofed house with a cellar door on the side. Much less a padlocked cellar. Tristan knelt by it, not unaware that the tools that would let him make quick work of this were likely on the other side of the padlock.

“Can you open it?” Song asked.

If not, they had brought the tools to smash it open. Tristran pushed up the padlock, read the maker’s mark and snorted.

“It’s a Gongmin lock,” he scorned. “Of course I can open it.”

He did not need proper thief’s tools for a Gongmin, only a pair of slender hairpins. A bit of a struggle until he found the angle, a hairpin digging into his palm, but then it popped open with a most satisfying click. He turned to look back, getting a polite clap from Maryam and a horrified look from Song.

“I thought Gongmin locks were fine work,” she said. “My father’s own study uses one.”

“They’re good quality but still workshop-made,” he said. “Once you know the way to pop one, you can do it to all of them.”

“Point to our house being behind the terrible work of an ancient murderous cultist,” Maryam noted. “Let’s see you pop that with hairpins, Tristan.”

He rolled his eyes, but it might be something to ask Professor Sizakele about. Late in the lesson, she was chattier when getting old. Setting the padlock aside, Tristan huffed and pulled up the cellar door. There was no light below, but they had brought a pair lanterns as well as their bags. A short flight of stairs led them into a rather small basement, all bare stone and smelling of wet.

Their possessions were, amusingly enough, neatly stacked in a corner of the basement with the most delicate of them put away in a wooden chest so they would not be damaged by the rain day. Unlocked.

Tristan quickly the only two possessions he truly cared about – his delightful tricorn, immediately put on, and Yong’s pistol getting tucked away – then drifted to the opposite corner with a lantern. There the Ninth Brigade was keeping the goods they did not want to risk being caught with, which were…

“Mostly drugs,” he called out, picking through the chests. “Some bottles that could be either alchemy or poison, some lemure body parts and…”

He frowned, leaning forward. Stacks wrapped in waxed cloth.

“Books,” he said, paging through. “Restricted lore, I assume.”

Not that all of them were that, he discovered after paging through some volume in Samratrava that had appended illustrations displaying naked people in a variety of positions that seemed more fitting for contortionists than lovers. All things given, one seemed a lot less likely to get hurt listening to the book with the bleeding eyes drawn on the cover than the one encouraging you to do that while also doing the split.

“Some of this stuff could sell well,” Tristan noted. “Song?”

The captain frowned.

“I am inclined to leave it,” she said. “Taking back our belongings from the Ninth is one thing, to take theirs is another.”

That was, in truth, the way he was leaning too.

“They slapped us around like they meant to, so they should now let it go so long as we don’t make a fuss about taking back our things,” he agreed. “With Tredegar gone there’s really no reason for us to have bad blood with Camaron and his lot.”

“He robbed us,” Maryam argued. “It would only be fair to do it back.”

“Hatchets are not always the solution,” Song told her.

How Maryam, who could barely use a cooking knife without losing a finger, was apparently deadly when throwing hatchets was something Tristan would need to look into.

“Then we set this house on fire,” she said. “There will be no proof it was us.”

“Except for our belongings being back in our hands,” Tristan pointed out. “It’s not worth the trouble, Maryam. Mind you, if they’d had gold lying around…”

A little interest on the loan of their possessions would not have been going overboard.

“But they do not,” Song sternly said.

“They do not,” he agreed.

Maryam conceded, though she groused all the while, and they packed up their belongings. As Song had told them, none of Tredegar’s possessions were there. Bold of Sebastian Camaron to try and poach someone who had publicly humiliated his own enforcer, but then the boy had seemed like someone raised to believe consequences only happened to other people.

The three took back to the street, heading towards Templeward, and only when they were near that large boulevard did Tristan allow himself to indulge in his curiosity.

“What’s your letter about, anyhow?” he asked. “Best to check before we head back to the cottage, I would not want to have to return tonight.”

Song shot him a look that made it clear she was not fooled by the pretense in the least, but reached for her letter anyway. She broke the seal and unfolded the letter, eyes flicking left to right. A long moment passed.

“Ah,” she said.

“Ah?” Tristan asked.

“It appears our journey to the Asphodel Rectorate is not so distant as we were made to believe,” Song Ren said, “and that I have a great deal to speak with Angharad about.”

# Chapter 36

Angharad should be in bed.

Safely under her sheets back in the Triangle, the door locked and trusted comrades in the rooms around hers. Or at a tavern by the docks, drowning her fear in the noise of revelry. Or even with her uncle, who had sought her company but she had forced herself to turn down with precisely spoken words – every last one tasting of ash on her tongue.

Instead she was out here in the dark, a fool on a fool’s errand. The golden Orrery lights were distant, disdaining to light her travels, so Angharad Tredegar carried with her an isle of light. A lantern, shuttered down to the very barest slice, casting a trembling circle of paleness around her. Like a fairy ring from the old tales, keeping the spirits out.

Not that the monsters stalking this night would heed it. Angharad was a long way from home, and here the old laws of Peredur were but whispers on the wind.

She had followed the boulevard for what felt like hours. A broad, nameless road of great pavement stones turned smooth by time and rain. Straying would have been faster, through ruins and empty canals, but Angharad knew better. She felt the eyes on her, waiting beyond the cast of her lantern. Patient, silent. Hungry. Let them come out in the open, if they wanted her. Let the nightmares step into the light.

Captain Phalani had warned her they hunted as a pack, so she knew better than to believe the beast was alone when it slunk into sight.

The lycosi stepped out of a gutted house’s belly, its walk somehow like a spider’s crawl– weightless and too-quick, unnatural to the eye. It was furred and had a wolf’s head, but there ended the resemblance to the lupines of the Dominion.

The lycosi stood tall on bent legs not much like a hound’s: the proportions were off, the lower part of the leg almost as long as the upper. More like a man’s arm than a beast’s leg. The back legs were thicker at the leg, for leaping, and mangy gray-black fur hung loose on the frame. It had no ears, instead curved horns not unlike a ram’s, and its eyes were an eerily round black. A serpentine tongue hung loosely from the opened maw of yellowing fangs, its legs ending in almost overgrown claws curving like a hawk’s.

It approached without hurry, bait to draw her eye while the others crept up from behind.

“My people,” Angharad told the lycosi, “they despise wolves.”

The Pereduri breathed out, straightened her back and slid out her saber. She should be in bed. Wandering Port Allazei alone at night, it was a fine way to get yourself killed. And yet her she was.

“My mother, she said it is because our soil is poor and cattle is as much our lifeline as the sea,” the mirror-dancer said. “My father, though, he said the root is deeper. An old story.”

She gently put the lantern down on the ground. Its light narrowed, the pale shrinking and ceding the rest of the world to shadow.

“In those days before the Isles were bound as one, there was once a great ruler called Queen Branwen,” she said. “Have you ever heard of her?”

The first came from behind, claws scraping so lightly against the stone there was hardly a sound. But hardly still was, and the mirror-dancer had a keen ear.

The monster stepped into the light, the monster bled.

The fur was thick and the skin beneath tough as leather, but a single stroke split open the lycosi’s shoulder – it drew back with a whine, spilling black ichor.

“There are as many tales about Queen Branwen as there are grains of sand in an hourglass,” Angharad said, “but the most famous is not of her rise but her old age. When her might had waned and younger, hungrier queens came for her lands.”

The dance had opened in earnest and she saw them now, lurking beyond the rim of pale. Black eyes and wicked horns, the pearly glint of open maws. Right and left, charging. The bait looming at her back, skulking ever closer. The wounded one, just beyond the edge of the light. All patient, but so was she.

One and two and three, like the rocks swinging on ropes in the backyard that was now as much a land of the dead as this graveyard city.

Angharad stepped forward at the very last moment, the charging lycosi crashing into each other – shoulders tangled, spinning away with growls. And in that moment where they had been as a single ball of fur and fury, they stood between Angharad and the skulker like a wall.

She slid into that opening smoothly, going for the wounded beast – which fled, away from the lantern’s light and towards a collapsed shop on the edge of the boulevard. Trap, she decided, and did not follow. A fifth must be lying in wait. Angharad withdrew back to the circle, spinning her sword hand to limber it.

“Aged was she, Queen Branwen, but she met her rivals on the field,” Angharad said. “And three of these hungry young queens did she fell, before the last speared her through the throat.”

The runner had not returned, and the hidden one remained out of sight. The three that remained fanned out, spread around the fairy ring of pale. Left-middle-right, moving to encircle. No matter how quick Angharad was, she could only face one direction at a time.

“But Branwen’s daughters dragged her corpse away from the battlefield,” she said, “and as their mother had taught them, put the body in a great bronze cauldron they had never before been allowed to touch.”

Angharad softly laughed.

“And after a night in the water, Queen Branwen rose from the cauldron a living woman.”

It happened like this: Angharad Tredegar moved to the left, towards that edge of the circle, and the monsters moved with her. Left-wolf, watched, eyes cunning. Middle-wolf snarled, but right-wolf cut before it. It darted past the rim of the light, howling, and-

(A skull split open, right-wolf dropping, but from behind middle-wolf leaped.)

-and Angharad Tredegar clicked her tongue. Right-wolf had gone low, legs all askew, and she took the blow it offered. Waiting until speed and mass forbade turning back, then flicking her wrist and slicing through the leg just below the articulation. And as in the glimpse, the beasts sprang their trick. Left-wolf moved, to bait a pivot from her, while middle-wolf leaped.

Pin and strike, as old a song as the world had known bloodspill.

Only, as the lycosi she had crippled tumbled further down the boulevard, Angharad swung around her back foot and raised her saber point first.

When the middle-wolf leaped, she extended her arm almost gently and stepped into the kill: the point pushed into the beast’s throat just below the maw, clean and deep, before Angharad pivoted outwards. She ripped the blade out just before the now-dead lycosi fell past her, turning to face the last unwounded.

“Thus was the power of the cauldron, won from a great spirit in her youth: so long as Queen Branwen did not break with honor, should her daughters lay her to rest in the waters for a night she would live again.”

That dark-eyed beast licked its chops, gaze darting between its dead fellow and the crippled one. A snarl and it slowly backed out of the light. Angharad loosened her stance, an eye on the one whose leg she had cut through.

The lycosi that had left the light bolted. Ran for it without whimper or growl. Clever thing.

A glance behind told her the beast whose shoulder she had wounded had, too, disappeared into the dark. The fifth and last never even came into sight. She turned to the last, three-legged one. It was limping away.

 “From summer to winter, Queen Branwen fed the crows,” Angharad said. “Always she stood her own champion, her word iron, and though twice more she was slain twice more she returned. She buried so many crowns the tale goes they are found by plows to this day.”

Angharad followed behind the beast, calmly. Her steps on stone rang of the inevitable.

“So when winter brought truce, her rivals plotted,” she said. “They sent a beautiful singer to Branwen’s daughters, to seduce them, and whisper thus: if your mother cannot die, how can you ever rule after her?”

The beast had wits, more than most lemures. It grasped it would not be able to lose her after mere moments. It slowed, feigned tripping even as it bled ichor all over the stone.

“We cannot slay our mother, Branwen’s daughters replied. All the world curses such an act. You need not lay a hand on her, the singer whispered. Only, when she dies anew and you bring her to the cauldron, open the gates of your hall and flee. She will not return, and none will ever curse your name.”

Angharad stepped into the trap, approaching, and saw the lay of the attack in which muscles tensed. Left back leg, the front right leg at an angle: fangs, belly height. She struck half a moment before it attacked, splitting open the skull between the horns and spilling brains and black all over the cobblestone. It died before it could even grasp what was happening.

She stood over the corpse, softly panting, and closed her eyes. Pricked her ear, but nothing crept through the night.

“Spring came, and Queen Branwen fed the crows,” Angharad said. “Yet her rivals were not without mettle, and she was slain once more. Her daughters brought her to the cauldron but, seduced by the singer’s words, opened the gates of the hall and fled.”

She flicked the ichor off the blade, reaching for the cloth tucked away in her coat and wiping the steel clean. Ichor left to linger was death on a good blade, worse than blood or seawater.

“And during the night,” Angharad murmured, “a wolf crept into Branwen’s hall. Past the cold hearth and the empty tables, until it found a corpse in a cauldron. And it ate, the beast, ate its fill. Gobbled her up until nothing was left.”

She sheathed her saber.

“Queen Branwen did not rise again Her kingdom fell, her daughters reigned over nothing and were accursed as traitors,” Angharad said. “And wolves? Wolves we despise, for their fangs know nothing of honor and dishonor.”

She walked away from the corpses without a single glance back. Perhaps the creatures would know better than to trouble daughters of Peredur, when they next hunted in the night. Or perhaps not. Perhaps Father was right, and the only bargain to be had with wolves was the exchange of violence. Blade and fang, order against disorder.

As a girl, Angharad had scorned the daughters. Of course she had, seeing herself in the fearsome Branwen who so fed the crows. Now, though, she must wonder. Did it make her one of the daughters, that a pretty singer had charged her with treachery? Yet a fear lurked beneath that answer, a deeper whisper.

Or was she now the wolf, blind and bloody fangs in the service of the wicked?

Angharad took up her lantern, resuming her journey, but not before pulling at the collar of her coat. It felt cold out, all of sudden.

—

How could a woman find the footsteps of a ghost?

Angharad had been given a map by a liar’s hand, but those lines of ink on paper proved too weak a lantern to catch the trail of Tristan Abrascal. The thief had marked a rooftop with a stolen grenade, shattered a roof to fall into the hidden path below it, but these parts had many roofs and many of them were broken.

Her haystack was made of needles.

She rode the nameless boulevard as long as she could, but it spat her out in a rat’s nest of small, cramped alleys twisting every which way. As if trying to flee some ancient shame, each wriggling like a worm. The liar’s map only bore the broadest strokes, boulevards and avenues, and what lay in between was like most of Imani Langa’s words: empty. So were these streets, surrendered to silence and dust.

Out here it was only her, the lantern and what lay waiting in the dark.

Angharad raised her lantern to peer through the broken shutters of a once-shop – was there anything on this island but ruins and ruination? – but the darkness was shallow. It fled before the slice of light, too weak to be a gate into the Witching Hour.

Shallow, she realized, but not silent.

Dark eyes went to the edge of the window, and there she found a drop of water sliding past the edge. Down the wall, but the droplet refused to be swallowed by the dust. And when her gaze slid back up to the windowsill it was to see a rivulet. Then a second, the streams spilling down until the empty window was as a gutter mouth spilling a river.

Angharad drew back warily, but the scent caught up to her. Salt. Seawater, it was seawater. So far from the docks that seemed impossible, but… No, there was an answer. One she dreaded, but an answer nonetheless.

“Fisher,” she said. “You are here.”

What the wind whispered in her ears was not words, for the Fisher did not speak in them. It was what her mind forced them to be, for that was a burden it could bear – buckle under, but bear.

“You are lost.”

It was the sound of thread being pulled taut, of a life on the edge of a knife. Angharad swallowed. He did not mean the streets the lantern light was lapping at. A question burned tongue and it was not wise to ask it, but she must.

“Tintavel,” she said, licking her lips. “It is old, but you are older yet. Can you… do you know how to break someone out of it?”

“Strength is the key to every lock.”

She grit her teeth.

“You know nothing, then,” she bit out.

The Fisher did not answer, but neither did it leave.

She could see his mark from the corner of her eye. Water flowing just out of sight, just out of the lantern’s reach. So dark one might think it liquid night, gone when she looked, like a mirage. Swallowing, part of her wishing that the attention of the spirit she was bound to were in any way a comfort, Angharad headed deeper into the dark.

And whispers came with hers.

“Your father,” the Fisher said, and the word was almost fond, “once told me them. The words you offered to the dark.”

Angharad flinched, gaze chasing after the too-quick water. She could smell nothing but salt.

“My father spoke to you?” she asked.

She had suspected, else how could he send her down the right path, but to hear it said…

“Branwen’s tale,” the Fisher said, ignoring her startled question. “Would you like to hear it?”

“I know it already,” she said.

A laugh like teeth clenched so hard they cracked.

“You only know the lie.”

Angharad shivered. Cold or fear? It did not matter. The answer was not in doubt.

“The truth,” she said, “is always better than the lie. Always.”

“Nothing is always,” the Fisher said. “But Branwen tried.”

And so Angharad ventured into the dark, carrying with her only three things: trembling light, steel and the tale of an old monster.

“There is only one law, the eldest law, and its name is extinction. But the Crow-Queen was clever, and the clever fear always fear to end.”

Three corners Angharad turned before she understood that the street had curved and she was now behind where she had begun. Her jaw clenched. What lay ahead of her, save growing more deeply lost? She could not read the lay of this maze at all. It was as if the dark was fighting her, turning her away.

“Branwen wove a net out of maybe, and journeyed to where the world cracks,” the Fisher said. “There she cast the net and caught her death, like a fisherman catches fish.”

Angharad was no navigator, or even much of a huntress. Neither was she a roof-treader, a thief for this manner of night, and surrounded by walls that seemed to close in from beyond the ring of pale she felt as lost as the Fisher had claimed her to be. She could not read the lay of the maze, no. And she did not have the strength to open that lock. So what could she read?

Ebb and flow, she thought. Not thief’s work but a mirror-dancer’s. That much she could do.

“The Crow-Queen pulled it up wriggling and laughed. She could not die if her death was not free to catch her, so she fashioned a cauldron of bronze and a lid for it. Her death she threw inside, and tightly bound the lid with chains so it could never escape.”

Ambling through the maze, Angharad stopped looking for paths and instead let herself feel it. Like Mother had felt the tides and winds, a knack beyond what charts and compasses could tell her. A battle had taken place here, and treading those cobblestone streets with her hands trailing against the walls Angharad could almost see it unfold in her mind’s eye.

Tristan catching sight of a member of the Forty-Ninth, hiding. Sniffing out the ambush. Where to from here? Not through, not back. They would catch him, or follow. Up, Angharad thought. She ran her hand up the stone wall, looking for purchase. There were arches across, that would be the way. She climbed, the loose masonry of the old houses making it easy, and followed the shade within her mind.

The Fisher went with her, the water ever just out of sight but his words always reaching.

“Branwen, clever queen, grew fat and happy. Made daughters. Rivers went dry and mountains became hills, but she did not die. This was known, and her secret coveted for few are clever and many are hungry.”

Tristan, from his perch, would not fight. No, first he would watch. Count his foes, learn what he would be headed into. And then what? Not run, there was no point. The enemy had a contract. He must first cripple them so they could not catch up. Angharad moved across the grass-and-vines strewn rooftops, moving towards the thickest knot of streets. The natural confluence of the maze, where the Forty-Ninth would have laid their ambush.

The noose Tristan had fought to slip. 

“The Crow-Queen did not share her secret, for if she did the prison of her death would be known. Thus she was warred on, but could not die. Yet her daughters could, and though the queen won her wars many of her daughters were slain.”

It would have happened here, Angharad thought. The girl Fara taken unaware, silenced. Muchen He catching on, climbing. Blades coming out. Angharad, two rooftops deeper, finally found she found what she was looking for: a roof with rough hole at the center. Collapsed, from its jagged shape, and recently enough that no vine had spread through it.

Angharad made the jump across the street easily enough, wondering if she could have made it silently. Not if wearing a cloak, she thought. Tristan had, when he silenced the Malani girl he’d then crippled.

“Branwen’s daughters asked for her secret, that they might war for her deathless,” the Fisher said. “But the queen refused. Convening in secret, they decided thus: if they could not be made deathless, they would instead take their mother’s deathlessness.”

Standing on that same rooftop with the breeze at her back – and it was the right roof, the faint scorch marks around the rim of the collapse made that clear – Angharad took a moment to look back behind her. At the battleground, seeing how carefully Tristan had threaded the needle and played an entire brigade like pieces on a board before being caught.

Angharad had been taught how to use her surroundings in a fight, maneuver with the terrain, but in the end all her methods sprang from the strength of her arm. What the thief had done, weaving his weaknesses into a rope, it was tactics she would struggle to match. And improvised, too.

The Sacromontan might not be a fighter, but that did not mean he was not dangerous.

“They betrayed her,” Angharad quietly said. “Like in the story I told. Branwen’s daughters.”

“They ate her,” the Fisher said. “To eat her deathlessness.”

Angharad flinched. Not only kinslayers but cannibals? Few crimes were fouler.

“After, the daughters stood in a circle and chose one of them to test. But the daughter was struck dead, for the secret was not in Branwen’s flesh, and they wailed. Fearful of what they had done, they sought to bury their sister with honor.”

Her fingers clenched. She could see it, how the threads pulled together.

“The cauldron,” she said. “They opened the cauldron to bury her in it.”

The Fisher laughed and it was a dreadful thing: a cold wind rattling through the door, a lover’s kiss refused.

“Branwen’s death sought her, at last,” the Fisher said. “It found her in her daughters, and that settling changed them. Broke and rent them, bent their names.”

She could feel the old spirit’s glee.

“The hungry, empty things that were thus made they called wolves. And so their kind is reviled, for they carry in them treachery and death.”

Angharad did not reply. Her gaze moved to the hole, the gaping maw. It was flooding: entire rivers of seawater coming from beyond the lantern’s light, falling past the edge. The curtains disappeared into the dark. It was the way into the Witching Hour, the Fisher was telling her as much.

And more troublingly still, he wanted her to go inside.

“Tristan,” she quietly said, “said he could not use his contract within. Is your strength greater than his spirit’s, then? Or will you be barred entry as well?”

“You do not listen,” the Fisher said.

He sounded irritated, if a mountain could be irritated.

“Then tell me again,” she bit back.

“What rules you, Angharad Tredegar?” he asked.

She blinked, opened her mouth. Closed it. Angharad had loved stories, as a girl. And she could see the lesson in the Fisher’s, however bloody the telling.

“Fear,” she said. “Branwen died because of fear. Hers and that of her daughters.  That is your meaning. All this, elder, to chide me?”

“Fear is the bridle of failure,” the Fisher said. “Are you the horse or the rider?”

Silence. Her fingers clenched.

“I do not fear Imani Langa,” she said. “I do her bidding only-”

And then he was gone. Every trace of water, every whisper, every touch on her soul. Feeling strangely empty, Angharad was left to look down at the pit of darkness. Alone again with her lantern and the dark. It had not been a lie, what she said. She did not fear Imani Langa. But perhaps it had not been the truth, either, for she feared what lay behind the ufudu. The reach and power of the Lefthand House, what it could grant and withhold.

The Fisher did not care, she thought, that was she was striking a bargain with a servant of Malan. It was not in his nature to care for such things. What mattered to him was the why. That she acted not for her own purposes but out of fear. Angharad swallowed.

Yet what else could she do? Nothing. There were only dead ends ahead, save for the dark at her feet.

“Defense is delay,” Angharad whispered.

It was the voice of a woman trying to convince herself.

She stepped forward.

She fell.

—

Not knowing how she came to be there, Angharad stood above and under Hell, looking up.

Smoke filled the sky, canvas to ruinous red light as the Grand Orrery’s pale glare failed to pierce through – instead showing as a harsh, austere glare made out behind the curtain. And beneath her, ancestors…

She froze, choking on her own breath.

Smoke and screams on the wind. Salt in the air, the distant crash of the sea and… no, this was not Llanw Hall. She was atop a hill, but one crowded by houses and warehouses. Not looking down on river and fields of green. In and out she breathed, until her heart had calmed and her hands no longer trembled. She could feel sweat on the small of her back, as much from the wet heat in the air as the cold water that had filled her belly.

The Hell beneath her was of a different kind. It was a city swallowed by battle, a tide of fire and steel and blood. Tolomontera looked… not young, but younger. Now that her heart was no longer thundering she recognized where she was: the summit of the Old Playhouse, at the very top of the stairs. East of the docks, and from this perch she could see a city falling.

The ramparts around the docks had wooden protections atop them – hoarding, Song had called them – but large swaths were aflame. The battle had spilled past the docks, into the streets, though there was still fighting around the edges. Thunder rolled out from the bay, drawing her eye. Anchored in the water were a dozen carracks, shrouded in smoke from the cannons. They were not the only ships. There were wrecks in the water, and crowding the docks were Watch galleasses flying black banners.

Tightening her fingers had Angharad realizing she still held her lantern. Swallowing dry spit, she turned her gaze north. Fighting there as well, not far past the tip of the Triangle. There were not as many lights as by the fort that was to become the Watch barracks, where a large pitched battle was taking place, but she could see a Watch force had driven deep into the city.

 She shivered in the wind, despite the heat. Far west, at the edge of the city, there were lights and smoke as well. The Watch must be attacking Allazei from land on a second front.

From up here it felt like a dream, or perhaps the sketch of some errant nightmare. If she went below, though…  But she must. It had taken more than a night’s span to take Port Allazei, yet Angharad doubted she would have so long in this half-dream. The Witching Hour would spit her out sooner or later, so she must hurry. Though not without care. Maryam had said death in here would kill her in truth, and though Angharad knew herself a fine blade there was little she could do against a company’s worth of muskets, or grapeshot.

If either existed yet. The cannons out in the water were slow to fire and seemed to miss the ramparts as often as not.

Her gaze dragged further north, where she must go. The Infernal Forge was her desire, and she knew who held it: the King of Hell himself, or at least his reflection in this aether-place. Lucifer, the liar had told her, was the one to cast the treasure into the aether for spite of the blackcloaks. She must find him before he did, and where he must be was plain: the hulking silhouette in the distance, glaring down at the port. Scholomance, not yet called that.

Where would a king be, if not in his palace?

So down Angharad went, down the steps and into the ancient nightmare.

The Old Playhouse stood broadly between Hostel Street and the bottom of Templeward, so she cast her path northwards. If she reached Templeward, she could follow the street to the tip of the Triangle and make her way from there to Arsay Avenue. That should take her straight to Scholomance, here as it did in the waking world.

It was a dreamlike thing, walking through these empty and hauntingly familiar streets.

And though the city felt like a ghosts’ assembly, it was not: torches ahead, none of them burning pale. They must belong to hollows, for darklings saw in the dark better than men but not perfectly: they, too, used torches to get around.

On approach, she understood her mistake. Now and then, Templeward Street was one of the largest streets in the city, one of the great arteries. It was only natural for hollows to be barricading the bottom of the street, stacking a hodgepodge mixture of plank palisade and mounds of furniture. Angharad did not dare come too close – they were sure to have warriors watching the side streets – but even from a distance she could see the defenses bristling with spears and crossbows.

Armed men in coats of mail and leather were shouting and-

The barricade burst into shards of wood and flesh. Angharad saw a cannon ball bounce on the cobblestones past it, whisked out of sight. Half the warriors fled, but a woman in a plumed helm raised a banner atop the barricade and shouted in a hollow cant. The warriors began to rally, until the second cannon volley raked through what was left of the barricade and carved bloody furrows through the defenders.

Gone was the piled furniture, leaving behind a carpet of broken wood, and gone was the bravery of men.

The sight had her swallowing in fear, but she mastered it. This nightmare was not for her, for she was but a passenger through this nightmare. The violence was the key to this lock: when the Watch – for it must be them manning the cannons – were done bombarding, they would storm the street. When the fighting lines collided, Angharad would cross Templeward into the Triangle and make her way north from there.

It now struck her as suicide to stay on the great street, which was sure to see much fighting.

She drew back a few blocks and began to circle past the height of the broken barricade, keeping her ear pricked for further cannon fire. None came. The rooks would be advancing soon. As she closed in on the side of Templeward, she realized that the darklings had emptied the street for fear of cannons. They had scattered into the houses and shops on the sides, into the alleys. She hid herself, quieting her breath and kneeling close to the ground. Waiting.

When it began, it was not with war cries but with screams: no fools they, the blackcloaks had brought up their cannons and leveled the houses on either side of the shattered barricade.

Thunder rolled, scything through the houses in sprays of wood and stone. Walls and rooftops collapsed, the hollows trapped within screaming. A few charged out bearing swords and spear, chain mail and plumed helmets gleaming red in the light of the fires, and Angharad got her first glimpse of the Watch at war.

Black-cloaked men and women, companies of pike and sword with the front led by bulky, unwieldy muskets. Officers shouted, the Watch frontline knelt and before the darklings came close enough to even throw spears a volley erupted in plumes of smoke.

Only corpses were left in its wake.

“Reload,” an officer with captains’ chevrons shouted in Antigua. “Down the avenue, fourth company! We don’t know how long Colonel Vidal will hold.”

The Watch was pushing north, she realized, to reach the fighting deeper into the city. Some earlier offensive must have gone wrong. No matter: this aether playacting was no war of hers.

Angharad waited until she heard crossbows twang and war cries resound before she sprang into movement, running out of the dead end into the street then across Templeward. She heard shouts in hollow tongues behind her, even a shot whizzing past, but did not slow. There was no light on the other side, only a winding street turning north. That corner would be her salvation, keeping her out of the sight of the-

Two men, facing away. Keeping guard. One tall, the other slender – both garbed in steel with red plumed helms. They heard her coming, as much from her running as the shouts, and were already turning when she stumbled onto them. Taken aback, Angharad stepped back and it gave the taller one time to raise his spear. The other one fumbled for his sword even as her saber cleared the scabbard. The tall one thrust the spear, forcing her further back, and at the head of the alley she glimpsed a woman aiming a crossbow.

Cursing, Angharad rolled under a spear thrust as the bolt went wide only to catch a kick in the stomach. Grunting in pain, she gripped the boot with her free hand and used it to trip the man – who went toppling with a shout. She rose, another bolt whistling past her, and found the slender one had his sword in hand. She feinted high and he backpedaled, so much that her follow-up came short.

Instead of carving halfway through his jaw with the swing she only cut the lip, the tip of the saber instead hitting the edge of his helm and sending it tumbling off his head.

The warrior moaned in pain and fear, drawing back, and Angharad aimed her blow. Only it sank in, then, what she was looking at: a pale-skinned boy, his lip cut and brown eyes wide. Utterly terrified. He’d barely known how to use his sword, and now she could see that how chain mail fit him ill. Too large, too loose. He was not even a hollow, Angharad reminded herself, but some illusion of one.

Neither sparing nor killing him held any meaning at all.

And still her blade halted against his neck. She grabbed him by the hair, instead, and tossed him onto the other man as he tried to get up. From the corner of her eye she saw crossbowwoman was aiming, so she fled. More shouting, none of which she understood beyond the anger, but as she headed deeper into the Triangle the sounds became distant. They must not be pursuing.

She knew better than to slow her steps.

Running through the streets of the dark mirror of a city she had come to know, the Pereduri stayed off the avenues as she cut north towards the upper half of the Triangle, then once there adjusted west closer to Regnant. There were few lights along it, so if she was lucky… but she was not. A quarter hour in she was forced to hide by a large column of armed men going down Regnant Avenue and its surrounding streets, grim-faced and singing in hollow cants.

She took refuge on a rooftop, pressing down against the tiles as the edge of the column filed past her.

Their arms and armor were disparate: chain mail and leather cuirasses paired with spears and warhammers and arquebuses. Not an army so much as a patchwork of them, few of which matched. There were so many banners she could hardly tell them apart, like a cloth mane on the snake of steel that was their column. Once the main body of the procession had passed, the narrower breadth meant they stuck to Regnant alone and she was able to slide down from her perch.

The journey resumed.

Unwilling to risk running into another column, she headed back northeast. Back towards the upper third of Templeward, as the narrowing near the summit of the Triangle made the distance between it and Regnant mere minutes now.

She saw the fighting before she heard it, columns of smoke and firelight. Near the tip of the Triangle, the same men the blackcloaks further south on Templeward sought to relieve. How had the blackcloaks made it so deep into the city? Killing her curiosity, Angharad forced herself to think. It was hard, as if her very mind was wading through water. Tiredness, perhaps. Could a soul even get tired?

Her best shot of getting at Arsay Avenue, she decided, was to skirt around the edge of the fighting. It was less likely to be guarded.

She headed towards the sights, sound soon catching up. Powder shots and screams echoed across the cobblestone, all below hellish lights writ on smoke. Lightning struck in the distance, thunder rolled and in that spurt of light Angharad saw the corpses ahead. Strewn across the street like discarded dolls, half a dozen blackcloaks lay unmoving on the stone. Her steps stuttered but she pressed on, raising her lantern higher.

They had been killed from behind, she read in the lay of the dead. Struck as they fled by blades and arrows, though the arrows were then ripped out.

One of the corpses let out a rattling breath, blood bubbling from the corner of her mouth, and Angharad reached for her saber before realizing  it was not a corpse at all. Kneeling by the survivor, she gently turned her over on her back as the blackcloak moaned in pain. The woman was tanned, for a Lierganen, and her faced dirtied with soot.

Lying face down there had been no visible wound on her, but now Angharad could see a gaping hole in her belly. A gunshot, and from close up. The survivor’s eyes fluttered open, unfocused, and stayed on Angharad’s coat. Black as her own ragged uniform.

“Water,” she croaked. “Please, wat-”

She began coughing, spitting out blood. Hers was not the kind of wound one survived without a fine physician and a great deal of luck – neither of which were at hand. It was an uncomfortable notion to go through the affairs of corpses, but Angharad forced herself to look for a canteen among the dead. A man with sergeant’s stripes had one, and after unscrewing it Angharad took a sniff. Water.

She knelt back by the survivor’s side, easing a trickle into her mouth. She slowed when the woman choked, but soon the ragged breathing eased some.

“Thank you,” the survivor rasped. “Ma’am. Sorry, I can’t see your rank. My vision’s swimming.”

“I am a student under Marshal de la Tavarin,” she replied. “To become Skiritai.”

She would not lie even to the ghost of a ghost.

“Militant,” the woman breathed out, as if awed. “Never met one of you before. I’m Miren, Miren of Saraya. Third Regiment, under Colonel Vidal.”

The same colonel the Watch forced had mentioned earlier. Her guess had been right, then, it was this same regiment that the blackcloaks sought to relieve.

“What happened, Miren?” Angharad asked.

She coughed again, struggled for her breath.

“The devils opened the gate, like that Mask said,” Miren said. “Let us in. We rolled the defenders on that big street, Templeward, and the colonel drove us north. To secure the tail end some long road that crosses half the city, leads straight to the Lightbringer’s palace.”

Arsay Avenue, Angharad thought. The very road she was headed to.

“You did not make it there,” she said.

“No,” Miren bitterly laughed. “The plaza, it looked empty. We didn’t see the man until the vanguard was close enough to shoot.”

Angharad blinked.

“One man?”

Miren feebly tried to reach for the canteen and Angharad gently pushed her trembling hand down before pressing the metal rim to her lips again. After a few moments of drinking, the dying woman sighed.

“Sunless House,” she panted. “Sunless House. It was fucking archbishop, straight out of the Fall.”

“What happened?” she asked again, tone gentle.

“They went mad,” Miren said, hands shaking. “Some started clawing at their own eyes, screaming about how nothing is real, and the others…”

She drily swallowed, trembling.

“They turned on each other,” she whispered hoarsely. “I saw Rolando put a dagger in his own sister’s back and Cassander shot our captain in the head. Without a word, just shot him.  None of them saying nothing, their eyes all white, and…”

She was sobbing, Angharad lay a comforting hand on her shoulder, but Miren shook her off.

“It didn’t stop after men died,” she got out. “They tore into the bodies like animals, gorging on the flesh. I ran. Gods, I know I shouldn’t have but-”

“You did well,” Angharad murmured.

“He was standing in the middle of it,” Miren feverishly whispered, as if she hadn’t heard. “Just a man, dark hair, soft face. Arms behind his back, looking at us like we were dogs doing a trick. Just one man and he stopped the entire regiment cold.”

Misery Square, Angharad realized with a shiver of dread. There was only one large square in that part of the city, and it was Misery Square. Only Angharad was getting a whiff of the horrors that had earned it the sobriquet.

“The back of the column broke and ran,” Miren rasped. “Only hollows were lying in wait, ambushed us. It was a slaughter. I… someone shot me, didn’t see who.”

She licked her lips and Angharad eased a trickle into her mouth again.

“You don’t live through a gut shot like that, do you?” Miren quietly said.

Angharad swallowed, shook her head.

“I won’t make it back to our lines,” the soldier said. “And it, it hurts ma’am. Please.”

The Pereduri flinched.

“Please,” Miren begged.

It is not real, Angharad reminded herself. Just the impression of a night on aether. How long had it taken the real Miren to die, lying face down against the stone with that hole in her belly? An hour, two? How long before cold numbness triumphed over the pain?

“Close your eyes,” she said.

“Thank you,” Miren whispered, and did.

Angharad slid her saber out of the sheath, as quietly as she could.

“I read, once, that in the summer the streets of Saraya are as a carpet of flowers,” the noblewoman said.

Miren smiled.

“Like snow made of petals,” she said, “falling from the-”

Angharad slid the blade between the third and fourth ribs, deep into the heart. Death was not instant, almost never was. Angharad held her hand, whispering to think of the flower blooms in the light as Miren bled out. It took short of two minutes, the rook already weak from the gunshot. Eyes burning, Angharad forced herself up and ripped the blade free. She cleaned it with the cloth, sheathed it with hands that suddenly felt fragile.

“Rest well, Miren of Saraya. Until the Sleeping God wakes,” she whispered.

Angharad stayed well clear of what was not yet Misery Square.

—

Miren had warned her so she moved carefully, but they still took her by surprise.

She was mere minutes away from the dead watchmen when the ambush was sprung. The only warning was the twang of a crossbow loosing a bolt, and Angharad threw herself a shop door, bruising her shoulder but avoiding death. The darklings swept down the street, a throng a dozen strong bristling with arms – and there were more crossbows at the back. Shapes on rooftops, too, moving more like devils than men.

Unlike other darklings, none of these shouted war cries in their hollow cants. And though they moved swiftly, there was a stiffness… to the movement.

Staying out in the street was death, so Angharad kicked at the door she had smashed into. The latch broke, and inside she found – Miren? The sight gave her pause for half a heartbeat, just long enough for the woman to slash at her shoulder with a knife. Coat and flesh parted, Angharad letting out a hiss as the false blackcloak grinned in triumph. She drew back half a step, readying to charge in, and checked on the other warriors…

Only to find them gone. All of them. She glanced back through the door and found only darkness inside, the false Miren vanished.

“What is this?” Angharad hoarsely whispered.

Sword high, she stepped through and-

-Angharad stumbled through a doorway, landing on her hands and knees. She barely had the time to glimpse golden light on stone before she threw up. It was as if her stomach was being wrung out of her, squeeze by painful squeeze. When the last foul heave passed her lips she was left panting, looking down at her own sick, and drew back on her knees. She wiped her mouth with her sleeve.

The wound, she remembered, patting at her side.

Only there was no mark on her coat, and when she shrugged it off to pull up her sleeves no trace of the cut on her flesh. Only the soul entered a layer, Maryam had said. Only a soul could be wounded within. It was only a cut, Angharad reminded herself. Certainly nothing good, but hardly a death. It was not as if a soul could bleed out.

She rose to her feet, legs trembling, and her head swam with vertigo. Angharad sucked in a breath, part of her wondering if the air here had always been so hot. Above the golden light of the Grand Orrery moved, and with that sight came a delayed realization.

Angharad was back, out of the Witching Hour.

She had failed.

# Chapter 37

Treachery was afoot: the carrot seeds were gone.

Maryam might have been complicit in the crime, for when informed of this she offered no aid. Only profuse mockery, including some very unkind moralizing about how he who lived by petty larceny was doomed to be defeated by it. Petty. Petty! For once he was in full agreement with Fortuna, this was unacceptable talk. No, Tristan would have to thoroughly investigate this matter and prove her treason, rightfully relegating her to taking Theology notes for the both of them next class.

Now, if only his only ally in this grand work were not utterly incompetent.

“Maybe she used her eldritch Navigator powers to disappear them,” Fortuna suggested.

She was sitting atop a tree branch, the red trail of her dress trailing as she swung her legs.

“You are a goddess,” Tristan reproached. “How is anything eldritch to you?”

“I was only phrasing it this way for your sake,” she ineptly lied. “I think your field was cursed to be barren by a witch, it is the only reasonable explanation.”

Tristan wondered if she was being blatantly wrong on purpose. Even odds, he figured: it might simply be that she had not been paying attention to the entire affair beyond the amusement of outrage. The thief knelt in the dirt, carefully feeling out the soil. He had sown seeds rather liberally yesterday, but there was not so much as a single stray one left. Whoever had done this had acted methodically, and with malicious intent.

“Could be a devil ate them,” Fortuna suggested.

He rubbed the bridge of his nose.

“I resent that this last guess is the closest we have come to a working theory,” Tristan admitted.

“You need to listen to me more,” the Lady of Long Odds happily said. “I have all sorts of ideas.”

Not unlike a mangy dog had fleas, and about as respectably.

“It could have been foreigners,” he finally said.

It was a long and honored Sacromonte tradition to blame foreigners for troubles ranging from the rising price of bread to why your daughter had been caught half-naked with the neighbor’s son in the back of the shop. It would have irresponsible not to consider foreign involvement, one might argue. If they were an infanzon.

“I am no longer sure I want to be involved in this,” Song Ren drily said.

He flicked a glance back, finding the Tianxi standing at the edge of the garden with steaming mugs of tea in her hand. Tristan squinted her way, not having caught the approach. Had Maryam sent her accomplice to sabotage the investigation?

“I don’t know what it is you’re thinking, but I am almost certain I should feel insulted by it,” Song noted.

“Your help would be most welcome,” Tristan said, not openly adding as soon as I am certain you are not part of this conspiracy.

Fortuna, lending her ‘help’, immediately leaped down from her branch began crowding the captain. She stepped in too close, peering into Song’s eyes like some nosy tia trying to find out their color, and gestured at one of the mugs as if asking to take it. To Song Ren’s honor, she had never once fallen for this cheapest of ghost trickeries.

Unfortunately for Song, Fortuna had taken it as a challenge.

Purely for spite of his goddess, Tristan rose to his feet and ambled over to take the tea. No, he realized, not tea. At least not the proper kind: this was brewed… peppermint? Surprised but not displeased, Tristan actually took a sip for reasons beyond politeness. Peppermint was good for digestion and stomach pains, as well as tasting fine enough.

“I have run the numbers for the brigade funds,” Song said. “I believe we could go as far as ten ramas.”

Tristan chewed at his lip thoughtfully.

“Hage will bleed us if he realizes I’ve gold to slap on the counter,” he said. “The easiest way to avoid that would be asking for something in particular, not merely going fishing.”

She hesitated for a moment, brushing back her long braid.

“Ask about the local criminals,” Song finally said. “The rest we can get from the official reports on Asphodel, but that kind of knowledge will not make it onto them.”

Tristan gave an absent-minded nod. It had been an unpleasant surprise to learn that they were headed to Asphodel in three weeks, leaving them to scramble for preparations. Song had borrowed books from that fancy hidden Stripe library, but books would only get them so far. Hage was almost certain to have access to Mask reports on the Asphodel Rectorate, or Krypteia gossip just as good, and Tristan approved of asking about the local coteries.

“We’ll need to know our way around the underground no matter which of the contracts we end up getting,” he mused. “Getting the lay of the coteries in advance is a good investment. I would not be surprised if the Masks had a contact on the ground, either.”

Song’s impressively well-connected uncle had leaked to her in the letter how assignments would work: there were four contracts outstanding, and it would not be decided until they reached Asphodel which brigade received which. The man had not gone into details  about the contracts – could not or would not – but had mentioned that two were investigations, one an exorcism and the last a hunt.

Only the exorcism was likely to take them out of the capital, and not far. Even then finding the remnants of an old god was sure to be easier when you had a way to reach out to the people who could tell you which of the latest disappearances had been paid for.

“I expect that might be beyond our means to buy,” Song said, “but if the opportunity knocks…”

“Barely a day rich and already a spendthrift,” he teased.

She rolled her eyes.

“Maryam’s ties to Captain Yue could end up fruitful as well,” Song noted. “As the senior signifier on the island, she might be in the know for Asphodel affairs.”

“We lose little by asking,” Tristan shrugged.

The two stood there in silence for a long moment, sipping at their mugs. Song was the one to break it.

“Not a single seed left, I see,” she said.

Those last two words were not a figure of speech when coming out of Song Ren’s mouth. Tristan was not yet sure to what extent she could discern details, but she could read book script from across a room without any trouble. Part of him itched to ask how that would pair to, say, a telescope but theirs was not so comfortable a relationship that he could.

“Such meticulous extermination can only be the result of an enemy attack,” Tristan said.

“There are probably at least two birds, yes,” Song agreeably replied.

He paused.

“A what now?”

Song considered him for a moment, then her lips twitched.

“Maryam didn’t tell you.”

“Her treacheries are endless,” Tristan coldly said.

“She told me she saw a bird up on the roof yesterday,” Song informed him. “A magpie, by the description, though an unusually large one.”

“And she failed to tell me this because…”

A rusty groan, one of the drawing-room windows being cracked further open from the inside. They had been getting eavesdropped on.

“Because I thought it would be funny,” Maryam called out.

“See,” Fortuna mused, leaning against his shoulder. “I told you a witch was behind this.”

“Bruja,” Song slowly said. “Did she just call Maryam a witch?”

“Nothing less than she deserves,” Tristan sniffed.

He turned a squinting look up at the roof, but there was no trace of the alleged magpie. How had it made it up here, anyway? Sakkas had said that this place could only be found by those who already knew where it was, but no lock was perfect. If the Gloam working laid into this place was as a surrounding curtain, birds might have simply flown over it.  Or perhaps the magpies had nested there for generations? An impressive lineage, if true, though Tristan could not recall ever seeing or hearing a bird here before.

“A recent arrival, do you think?” he said.

“I am uncertain,” Song admitted, sounding fascinated. “It could be that an animal is not enough of a ‘mind’ to be turned away by the defense and our presence drew interest. More might come if that is the case.”

“A siege, then,” he muttered, then cleared his throat. “I will have to draw from brigade funds.”

A wary look.

“What for?” she asked.

“To make a scarecrow,” Tristan fiercely replied. “I yet have carrot seeds: I might have lost a battle, Song, but the war has just begun.”

“I was right,” Maryam called out through the window.

—

It was a mark of Captain Yue’s rank that she had a solar inside the walls of the chapterhouse.

Though not a small building by any means, much of the insides of the Akelarre headquarters was taken up by the Meadow so private rooms were virtually unheard of. There were dorms for Navigators to sleep in, libraries for restricted works and a few small study halls, but all these were shared. The captain’s large solar on the upper level was not, though Yue had crammed so many devices and books inside that a room as large as the cottage’s drawing room somehow felt cramped.

Maryam had learned, over the last few weeks, to tell when she was in for a pleasant afternoon by gauging the enthusiasm on the scarred captain’s face when she was ushered into the solar. Briskness meant it was drudgework ahead of them, checking options off a list not out of belief they were possible but to be through, while on the opposite end of the scale a broad grin meant things were going to get… exciting.

Like being rowed out into a shallow part of the bay and dropped into the sea with stones tied around her feet exciting.

“Ah, Maryam, just in time,” Yue grinned, and the Izvorica almost cursed.

It was going to be one of those, then. The older woman hurried her in, closing the door behind and guiding Maryam past a fresh pile of books – nearly all of which had iron girding and a lock, meaning they were from the deepest part of the restricted library – and the same half-eaten plate of fried rice that had been balancing precariously on the end of a table for three days.

The sheer number of precious instruments in here, from astrolabes to orreries to a set of beautifully engraved ring dials, had been intimidating at first. There was a fortune’s worth of devices surrounding her, many of them of intimidatingly fine make. Nowadays, though, they mostly felt like the clutter that they were. Yue eased Maryam into the usual cushy armchair, then headed across the room to a large, broad silhouette under a pale sheet.

“That is new,” Maryam noted.

“So it is,” Yue happily said. “Had it brought up this morning.”

She theatrically tore off the sheet, which she had obviously put there herself for this very purpose. What lay under looked halfway between a water maze and an Izcalli calendar: an upright stone disk, almost man-sized with layered circles within. Each circle was connected to another by some shallow notch and at the heart, instead of a large motif of an Izcalli calendar, was a gaping hole the size of the Izvorica’s head.

Captain Yue presented it with a flourish, visibly pleased with herself.

“Well done,” Maryam hazarded. “I am… impressed?”

The older Navigator wrinkled her nose.

“At least some put effort into the lie,” she complained, then sighed. “Think, Khaimov. Does this remind you of anything?”

To Maryam’s mild shame, it took another few seconds before catching on. It was the size that had distracted her: the other disk had been barely the size of two fists, and the patterns on the surface significantly more complicated than these.

“The Kuru Maze that Professor Baltazar showed us on our first day,” she said. “The device that lets one gauge their Grasp and Command.”

“You could consider this beauty the bastard cousin of a Kuru Maze,” Yue said, patting the disk.

“I don’t feel any conceptual symmetry from it at all,” she frowned. “The draw of a Kuru Maze is that it restricts manipulation of Gloam. This looks, well, like…”

“A big chunk of rock,” Captain Yue cheerfully said. “Because it is. Not a drop of anything conceptual here. It’s an Izcalli invention called a stele stone.”

“Ominous,” Maryam noted.

The Kingdom of Izcalli – and all the other Aztlan states, to be fair – had a fondness for carving skulls onto everything and their naming sense tended to the funerary. Even Captain Totec had a saltshaker sculpted to look like a dancing skeleton he was inordinately fond of.

“You know how it is with Izcalli,” Yue said. “No matter how sound the scholarship, their scholars don’t take anything seriously until there’s a body count supporting it.”

“The Kingdom of Izcalli is the leading light in metaphysical anatomy,” Maryam loyally said. “No one else understands souls half as well.”

“Yeah, they sure burned a lot of candles studying those,” Captain Yue drily said. “But I seem to recall the man who initiated you into the Akelarre is from Izcalli, so I’ll let you off this once.”

She slapped the stone again, like a farmer at market endorsing their prize pig.

“Stele stones,” Yue said, “are made when a significant number of people die on top of them.”

Maryam blinked, having not expected it to be so literal.

“They used to make these from physician’s floors,” the Tianxi said, “but these days I understand some lords have a racket of ordering their dying serfs to go and lay on top of them so they can sell off the stones.”

The Navigator shrugged.

“It does assure steadier supply.”

Captain Yue’s notion of good and evil tended to run along ‘things that make my work easier’ and ‘things that make my work harder’, which meant she had all the sympathy of an iron rod but also that she was remarkably lacking in bigotries.

“And the advantage to lugging around corpse rocks is…”

Maryam trailed off leadingly.

“Think it out,” Captain Yue said. “The stone used here is basalt, which on the Ban scale of aether sensitivity is lower-middle.”

Maryam hummed. To qualify as middle sensitivity on the Ban scale, a material must be affected by aether phenomenon not directed at it. The study of the effect of metaphysical forces on physical objects was usually considered a part of alchemy, but inevitably it was a matter of interest to both the Peiling Society and the Akelarre Guild and as a result the terms for it were drawn from a dozen different disciplines.

It was a real mess of everyone borrowing from each other and contradicting each other’s works.

The Ban scale had been used by Cathayan architects for over a century before the Akelarre adopted it, justifying this by noting the imprisoned scholar-concubine who’d first created it had been a signifier and thus the scale had always been part of their scholarly wheelhouse. While not the most exact out there, the Ban scale had the benefit of being made into a series of rhymes that translated well to most the major languages of Aurager – and thus was remarkably easy to memorize.

Lower-middle meant the material in question was affected by nearby aether phenomenon, but not unduly sensitive. For example a cutter, with its aether engine, could dock at a basalt dock and there would be no trace left on the stone. A death on top of the stone slab, though? That strong, instant release would leave some kind of mark.

Yue had mentioned physicians as the original source, which likely meant painful ends at the hands of cutters. Many deaths, though, and evidently the Izcalli lords out there seemed to think that sending the sick to die on the stone would work just as well. It’s not about the nature of the death, then, it’s about the numbers.

“Saturation,” Maryam said. “Stele stones are basalt saturated with aether.”

Yue cocked an eyebrow.

“And what would be the use of such a thing?” she asked.

“You called it the bastard cousin of a Kuru Maze because those constrict the use of Gloam,” she slowly said. “This would do the same for… aether?”

“Are you asking me or telling me?” Yue said.

She chewed at the inside of her cheek.

“Nav,” she said. “Logos, I mean. It goes through the aether, so a stele stone is meant to constrict the use of one’s logos.”

“Good,” the Tianxi smiled. “That is essentially correct.”

She waved a hand.

“The reality is slightly more complex – the maze carved on the surface is because of metaphysical continuance, a concept you won’t be learning about for some time yet. Suffice it to say that moving your logos through the channels in the stone is more difficult than, say, simply wrapping it around the disk.”

“Why are we testing my logos at all?” Maryam asked.

It was one of the few parts of signifying she’d never had any trouble with. She was, she fancied, a much defter hand with hers than most of her peers.

“Because I told you to,” Yue easily replied. “Come, I will show you how it functions.”

Maryam was always careful sending out her nav with Captain Yue around, knowing herself a candle besides a bonfire. It would have been easy for the other woman to snuff her out without even meaning to. Yue had asked her this time, though, and would be careful. It was an odd feeling, how the other woman coaxed her soul-effigy – like being a raft being pulled along in a galleon’s wake.

Yue guided her all the way to the opening of the stele stone, then goosed her nav as warning. Maryam withdrew, did not follow her in. Instead she tried to feel out what tracing the pattern did to Captain Yue’s nav, what coiled and what tensed. When the captain withdrew, after what could not have been longer than thirty heartbeats, she was faintly panting. Yue brushed back her braid on her shoulder, smoothing it back into place to hide the burns on her cheek and ear.

“It is a good control exercise,” Captain Yue said. “We will not teach logos manipulation until third year, as it’s much too easy for a beginner to rip out their own soul, but if my theory is correct you will have little choice in learning the basics early.”

By now Maryam knew better than to ask her to elaborate. If she intended to, she would have. Instead she gathered herself and felt out the entrance of the stele stone pattern. All she had to do was trace it, not fill those wide furrows, but to make one’s nav was fragile had its dangers: Maryam slid in a rope, not a string. Immediately she felt the saturation’s effect. Most objects were inert when felt out with nav, like dull contours in a world of colors.

The stele stone instead buzzed like flies’ wings, and she had to keep a firm grip on her nav lest it be swept astray.

She was surprised to find it rather easy, at least at first. She just had to thread in her nav, which took concentration but not much difficulty. Halfway through the first loop she began to grasp what Yue had been hinting at by ‘metaphysical continuance’. Maintaining the thread she had woven while continuing to push forward was significantly more difficult than she had thought. She had assumed the trouble would rise like the slope of a hill, but two thirds of the way through the first circle she felt like she had to climb a wall instead.

“Fuck,” she muttered.

“Further,” Yue quietly said. “You need to finish the first ring.”

Gritting her teeth, Maryam pushed on. She might not have made it had she not realized she could cannibalize her own earlier work. She could thin the rope and make it into string. It eased the pressure, though she still only barely made it to the notch leading to the second circle. She threaded past it by a hair, breathing out, and – the pull took her by such surprise she tumbled all the way back to halfway through the first circle.

“What in the-” she snarled, firming her grip.

The pull gave when she pushed back, but as she tried to reclaim the grounds lost she felt as if something was pushing against her. A hand on her shoulder, a pulse of Gloam.

“That’s enough,” Captain Yue said. “I have what I need, withdraw.”

Maryam was tempted to rip herself out, but forced herself into a controlled retreat instead. One should never treat their soul-effigy lightly. When she came back into herself she was panting, covered in sweat, and Yue eased her back into the seat. She spent some time gathering her bearings while Yue puttered about pouring something into cups, pressing a metal goblet into her hand. Maryam took a sniff.

“Brandy?” she asked.

“It will take the edge off that brutal migraine you’re about to have,” Yue said. “Drink.”

Maryam grimaced but did. It burned going down, but there was a faint aftertaste of apricot that took the edge off the lingering in the mouth.

“What was that?” she asked. “Something fought me, it felt like. Was it the stele stone?”

“The stone had aether presence but not consciousness,” Yue replied. “It cannot fight you.”

She leaned back against one of her tables, though she had to push back a strange overlarge bronze compass.

“What has puzzled me about your condition from the start,” Yue said, “is its seemingly contradictory nature.”

“I don’t follow,” Maryam frowned.

It seemed rather plain to her: her Command was lacking because it was sabotaged by an aether entity.

“First we established through layer diving that the cause of your measure imbalance is an aether entity,” Yue elaborated. “Seemingly straightforward, if an unusual case. But then I put you through about a third of the possession tests known to the Akelarre Guild and none of them turned up a thing.”

The Izvorica’s eyes widened in alarm.

“You said I wasn’t possessed,” Maryam said. “That those were-”

“To ascertain the nature of your ties to the entity, yes,” Yue dismissed. “And they were. Possession is a layman’s term, ultimately, evoking some dollmaker hollowing a man and walking around with his face and memories. In practice relatively few aether entities are capable of this.”

“You thought it was some lesser parasite,” she slowly said. “One that a possession test would unmask.”

“An unusual case, as I said: an entity that gorged on your emotions unhindered for so long it became something nearly unique,” Yue agreed. “Only you have none of the physical markers of this. Therefore, I resorted to the submersion test.”

“An individual submerged in the sea with no physical tie to above will achieve metaphysical isolation,” Maryam quoted. “You wanted to establish whether it had an anchor to me.”

“And it did,” Yue smiled, “else you would have been capable of signifying under water without trouble just as you did in the layer. Thus we established that the entity had an anchor on you, but that your body showed none of the usual markers. Now, it might have been that we simply needed to get into the more invasive possession tests…”

Maryam swallowed. Sticking needles in her body and making her Sign during was not considered invasive? Making her eat a lodestone, Sign and then throw it up had been one of the easy tests? Gods. She was almost afraid to ask.

“… but that is a brute method answer, Maryam, forcing a circle into a square peg. I found a more elegant solution: what if that anchor was on a material part of you without being a physical part?”

And there the reason for the use of the stele stone became clear.

“My logos,” Maryam breathed out. “Shit, it latched onto my logos. I use it to signify, so every time I trace a Sign-”

“It contends against you, ‘pulling’ the other way, and thus in practice reducing your Command to that of a child’s,” Yue finished. “Interestingly, that it latched on to your logos it also likely why it hasn’t slurped up your soul despite being tacked on to you for years.”

Maryam swallowed, mouth suddenly gone dry.

“Pardon?”

“Think of your logos as a straw, permitting only so much to be drunk at once,” the older woman said. “The most fascinating part is, however, that the parasite seems to have adapted to you to some extent, feeding solely on emotions that you reject or suppress. It grew nearly symbiotic.”

“And screws up my signifying,” the Izvorica flatly said.

“And that,” Yue agreed. “Happily for you, the violent reaction the entity had to your using the stele stone confirms another part of my theory.”

“It’s a bit of an asshole?” Maryam suggested.

Yue smiled thinly.

“It goes two ways,” she said. “Through your logos it can feed on you, but…”

“I can also feed on it,” Maryam said. “You’re sure?”

“It will not be possible to confirm it until I have some particular equipment prepared,” Yue said, “but I believe the chances are very high.”

Maryam licked her lips.

“What would it do, feeding on it?”

“Retrieving your past aether emanations, for one,” Yue said. “Though they will not be as linear and differentiated as when you emanated them. Secondly, well, think of it this way – though we Akelarre manipulate Gloam and navigate aether, we are ultimately creatures of the Glare. This entity, however, is not. It should perceive Vesper in some fundamentally different ways.”

“That sounds dangerous to absorb,” Maryam said.

“The mind is a wonderfully elastic thing,” Yue said. “It will take what it can and a little more, then the rest will be buried or shed away. I expect, at the very least that devouring the entity will make major qualitative improvements to your logos.”

On top of restoring her Command, presumably. That did sound tempting.

“And it would be safe?” Maryam asked.

The captain burst out laughing, hiccupping and slapping her knees until she was almost tearing up.

“Oh gods no,” Captain Yue chuckled. “Anything but. But the alternative is it being forever latched onto your logos, so the notion of there being a choice here is largely decorative.”

She was, Maryam grimly conceded, not wrong about that. She made herself breathe out, calm.

“Equipment, you said,” she tried.

“Worry not, my dear,” Yue grinned. “It will be ready before you take that ship to Asphodel. I greatly look forward to the results.”

The Izvorica nodded, then hesitated.

“Out with it,” the captain said.

“Song mentioned that the entity she encountered had a soul,” she said.

“Yes, as you mentioned before,” Yue acknowledged. “While Song Ren’s contract is an interesting tool, she has not real grounding in metaphysics. I expect she saw the traces of some soul the entity ate before latching on to you, or emanations fresh enough they could be confused for you.”

“And if you are wrong?” Maryam asked.

“Then I get the pleasure,” Captain Yue grinned, “of starting this puzzle from scratch.”

—

The Emerald Vaults was not large enough an establishment to loan private rooms, but their garden did have small gazebos that lent an appreciable degree of privacy.

Though they had agreed on six at the beginning of Warfare, Song arrived ten minutes early. Lierganen tended to have their evening meal late, but given the widespread provenance of the students – and indeed of watchmen in general – one could not assume the dinner room would be empty even at this hour. She was lucky: only one of the gazebos remained unoccupied, and she promptly claimed it before someone else could. Talk on the terrasse was too likely to be overheard, it would not suit at all.

Only a few of the tables were occupied, she saw as she followed the servant in, with black-clad youths sharing tapas and drinks. She recognized few faces within, the only one of note the towering Someshwari man that was the captain of the Twelfth. Song received a few curious looks, but now that there was gossip about the Forty-Ninth she was not as interesting a subject of rumor as she had been – at least until the Thirteenth’s involvement in that affair came out.

The servant in neat livery bowed after presenting her the last of three gazebo and she nodded in confirmation. It was pretty piece of work, a round pavilion of whose skeleton was intertwined metal and wood with silk sheets hung as walls to curtail sight and sought. Song ordered a cup of Sanxing green tea and settled into the cushioned seats, readying herself to wait.

To her mild amusement, she had barely tugged her coat back in place when Angharad arrived – just slightly less early.

The dark-skinned noblewoman must have swung by her lodgings, for despite having had Skiritai class this afternoon she wore a fitted regular’s uniform. Like most clothes, Angharad wore these well: she was tall and shapely, which did not hurt, and had the effortless posture of someone whose fingers had been smacked when she did not sit straight as a child. The gloves were new, though. The same she had worn in Warfare.

The braids had been redone recently, Song noted, and her face was schooled into a polite society mask. A taught thing, that. Song would know, having learned the same at her mother’s knee.

She had always seen just enough of herself in Angharad Tredegar to make mistakes over her.

“Song,” the Pereduri greeted her.

“Angharad,” she replied. “Please, be seated.”

They hardly waited three breaths before a servant was with them, asking what might suit the lady. Wine, to Song’s mild surprise. There was some small talk, but short and halting. Neither of them felt like getting into it with the conversation that loomed. Their orders arrived together, perfectly timed, and the servant retreated after another bow. Song sipped at her tea. Exquisite, as everything served in the Emerald Vaults always was.

“I received a letter from my granduncle,” she said. “It shed some light on what you implied when we spoke yesterday.”

Uncle Zhuge had been unusually loquacious in that letter, even. He usually preferred to speak instead of committing anything to paper, the well-honed instinct of a man who had spent decades in one of the most cutthroat Garrison postings around. This time, though, he had laid out details – even if through implication and idiom, careful to give nothing a Mask reading that letter might be able to use. Reading between the lines, the situation on Asphodel significantly had changed due to the Rectorate’s find beneath their island – long believed emptied of all Antediluvian treasures.

Instead all the great powers were eyeing that shipyard and the find of tomic alloys hungrily. Diplomats, spies and saboteurs would be sailing the way of Asphodel even as he wrote and civil war on the island was nearly sure to ensue. As the Watch had contracts with the Rectorate, the tests were now likely to take place during civil strife. A significantly greater of risk for the students than what had been desired.

The trouble, after that, had been making the massive bureaucracy of the Watch actually do something about it.

“My uncle informed me it was a significant effort to get the tests pushed up,” Angharad shared.

Song almost hummed. Vague talk, likely repeating the words of the man in question. The Pereduri had not actually been told the details, then, despite having one of the main actors present. Song’s own letter, despite becoming a veritable garden of euphemisms when reaching the matter of politics, had been rather more informative on the subject.

“It would be career suicide for them to try and take this back, if you were considering it,” Song told her. “They had to bring a motion to the Conclave while it was in session.”

Angharad blinked.

“I thought Tolomontera under the authority of the Obscure Committee, no longer the general Conclave,” she said.

Song nodded.

“That is correct,” she said. “But that committee was granted that authority by a sealed session – meaning it cannot be formally appealed to the way an open committee would be. In other words, since it does not openly exist it cannot be directly petitioned.”

“Surely the Conclave would dismiss any motion regarding these matters regardless,” Angharad frowned. “It would be contradicting its own grant of authority otherwise.”

“Indeed,” Song agreed. “And the first quarter of any session of the Conclave is usually dedicated to dismissing such improper petitions. Theirs was added to that docket directly – the trick, you see, was to have it dismissed in the right way.”

The Pereduri looked a little lost, so she took pity on her.

“There are two manners of dismissal,” Song explained. “The first is ‘peremptory’ – that is, immediately thrown out. The second is ‘assignation’, when the Conclave deems there is already a committee in charge of this matter and sends the petition to them.”

“The dismissal being of the second sort would see their petition sent to the Obscure Committee,” Angharad slowly said. “Is that it?”

Song smiled and sipped at her tea. A simple sentence but not so simple an achievement. The Conclave was a cutthroat arena of rival factions, so unless votes were mustered for your improper petition in advance – by reaching out to factions that would whip up the votes, or brokers that could deliver a bloc beholden to them – such petitions were always dismissed peremptorily. Uncle Zhuge had made a veiled reference to playing off two Garrison factions against each other and trading some favors to free company brokers.

They had still only narrowly reached the threshold for assignation, a mere five votes above the line.

“Essentially,” Song replied. “The powers brought into the matter were not insignificant, Angharad. If they were then humiliated by the motion they supported being retracted by the very officers that brought it forwards…”

“They would take revenge for that egg on their face,” Angharad flatly said. “Wielding the very same influence that was called on.”

There had been no way for Uncle Zhuge to know that Song’s brigade would come so close to splitting at the seams within a month of making it to Scholomance. He had assumed competence on her part, and it shamed her that she had proved him wrong.

“Part of the bargain struck between our sponsors was aid and preferential treatment from your uncle, given his direct involvement in the journey,” Song delicately said. “It is not impossible for his part to be held up while you are not part of the Thirteenth. There are other brigades going to Asphodel.”

Angharad snorted.

“Which am I to choose – Tupoc’s lot, the Eleventh or the Nineteenth?”

Song hid her surprise. The Forty-Ninth, which had been the fourth on her uncle’s list, had been disbanded and thus could not feasibly participate. She had not known who would replace them, however. Osian Tredegar must have told his niece.

“I was under the impression you were on fair terms with Captain Langa,” she said instead.

Angharad’s lips thinned.

“Not so fine as that,” she curtly said. “I would not go under Imani Langa’s command.”

Song sipped at her delightful tea, choosing her words with care. Were Commander Tredegar not present on the island and one of the leading officers of their expedition to Asphodel besides, she might have been tempted to wield strong words here. With the man in consideration, though, she could not. Osian Tredegar had proved himself a fierce and ruthless actor in the defense of his niece.

“I will take your word on it,” Song said. “Yet this brings us to similar trouble: were you to sail out with the Thirteenth, you would be under my command.”

A pause to let her light words sink in.

“You have expressed an unwillingness for this in the past.”

Angharad’s jaw locked.

“I would not shame you by refusing an order before others, but I-”

“No,” Song flatly interrupted. “Allow me to be perfectly clear: if you walk around as part of the Thirteenth and I am made responsible for your actions, you will be subject to my authority. If you cannot tolerate this, there are two other brigades for you to pick from.”

“I have given my reasons for not wanting to be under your command,” Angharad stiffly said.

“That is your prerogative,” Song said. “As it is mine to refuse taking on a soldier who has told me they’ve no intention of obeying me.”

“And the others will?” she bit out. “Tristan and Maryam-”

“Are none of your concern,” Song coldly replied.

“You cannot go to Asphodel with only three cabalists,” Angharad replied just as coldly.

Ah, predictable. Song had seen that one coming, and indeed spent part of the day wondering who she should round out the Thirteenth with should Anghard not intend to accompany them. A fighter, it would have to be, but who would agree? The difficulty was in finding someone who would be willing to leap feet first into the pit when they could instead wait and take their test when better prepared.

The solution had, therefore, been to find someone already in the pit.

“I expect it would take me somewhere around an hour to secure another Skiritai,” Song said. “There happens to be one deeply in my debt and eager to clear his name.”

One of the few ways Muchen He’s reputation could be salvaged when it came out what the Forty-Ninth had been involved in would be a display of trust from his purported victim – like, say, Tristan Abrascal publicly welcoming him into the Thirteenth Brigade. Rumors that Muchen had been Song’s spy and collaborator would begin sprouting without even need for sowing.

That the man would accept was not really in doubt; if Song would have to ask still was.

Angharad frowned but did not call her a liar. There was still enough respect between them for that, or at least the Pereduri thought it possible she might not be lying despite knowing little of the affair. The Pereduri grimaced.

“I am not wrong, for not wanting to take your orders,” she insisted.

“Neither am I for refusing to be responsible for someone else’s cabalist,” Song replied.

She drained the rest of her cup.

“Good tea,” she said. “There is still time before we leave, Angharad. You know my terms – if they do not suit, speak with the other captains.”

She made to rise, but Angharad put a hand on her forearm to hold her back.

“That is,” the dark-skinned woman said, then swallowed, “please sit down.”

“It seems to me this conversation has come to a natural end,” Song gently said.

She flicked a steady glance at Angharad’s gloved hand. She withdrew it as if burned.

“I understand how what I asked would be unacceptable for you,” Angharad said. “It’s, I-”

She sighed, kneading her forehead. The sign of weakness was so unlike her that Song slowly slid back into her seat.

“I was overly confrontational, given what I requested,” Angharad said. “For that I apologize. I slept poorly and find myself in a difficult mood.”

Song’s eyes narrowed. That was one time too many she acted out of sorts. It would be irresponsible not to investigate, a failure of her duty as a watchwoman.

“Your gloves,” she said. “Why are you wearing them?”

Angharad blinked.

“It is a cool day,” she said.

No cooler than the last.

“Did you buy them today?” Song pressed.

“I,” Angharad frowned. “Yes, I think?”

Memory irregularities. Second string.

“Ah,” Song said, putting on a pleasant smile. “Let us continue the conversation, regardless. Would you call the waiter?”

Angharad jerkily nodded, leaning out of the gazebo to catch the man’s eye, and the moment she was facing the wrong way Song smoothly drew her pistol and pointed it at her chest. Angharad stiffened.

“Song, what in the name of-”

“Do not turn,” Song calmly replied, “or I will pull that trigger. Your brigade plaque, is it on you?”

“In my pocket, yes,” Angharad angrily replied. “What is this?”

“Take it out,” she said.

Visibly furious, the Pereduri began to reach for it but Song clicked her tongue.

“Take off the gloves first,” she said.

Angharad blinked, as if confused.

“What?”

“Take off the gloves first,” Song slowly repeated.

“I don’t understand,” Angharad slurred, speaking if through molasses. “What do you-”

Song cocked her pistol. Fear should push through.

“Take off your gloves and put the plaque in the palm of your hand,” she ordered. “Right now.”

Angharad blinked in confusion, but she tugged off a glove and plucked out the silvery plaque.

“What now?” she scorned, holding it up. “Am I to-”

The smell of burning flesh stole the words out of both their mouths. Third string. A heartbeat later the creature began screaming through Angharad Tredegar’s mouth and it all went to the dogs.

For once in her life, it brought Song Ren no pleasure to have been right.

# Chapter 38

Song put on her formal uniform for the hospital visit.

It was a gesture of respect, at least to her people, and she suspected that were she awake Angharad would understand better than most. Malani lived and died by appearances, after all. By now the way to the healing ward was almost painfully familiar, but she refrained from heading there directly after her Strategy class ended. If she did, the odds were decent she would run into the Thirty-First on a visit of their own.

The prospect of making stilted small talk with Ferranda Villazur and her cabal over Angharad’s unconscious form was rather unpalatable, so she held back until late in the afternoon.

Tristan was busy losing a battle of wits with a bird – one that her eyes confirmed was no lemure, thankfully – and Song had not even bothered asking Maryam if she wanted to join her on the visit, so it was alone she stood as she reached the gates of the hospital. The bored pair of guards at the gate waved her in after asking for her brigade seal, hardly even glancing at it.

The gray-robed attendant at the front was rather more dutiful, noting the number on the seal and asking who she sought to visit and why.

“Angharad Tredegar,” Song replied. “Merely to look in on her.”

The other woman nodded, writing it out in Antigua. But a few years older than Song, the stranger had the Cathayan look and must have been raised back in Tianxia for she had a thick eastern accent.

“Wendi?” Song curiously asked, accenting the word as they did out east.

The gray-robed attendant started in surprise, then smiled.

“I lived in the republic until the age of ten, yes,” she replied in Machin.

The eastern dialect was older than proper Cathayan, but shared common roots with the dead tongue that Cathayan had been carved out from – it made everything said in it sound rather stiff, which was why in plays the common conceit about characters from the Republic of Wendi was that they were pompous blowhards. Likely it did not help that the Duchy of Wendi had been the last Tianxi realm to become a republic.

“By the accent I would call you a Mazu girl, but the name tells me otherwise,” she continued.

Song’s lips thinned. It had not been safe for the Ren to stay in Jigong, after the Dimming. Part of the deal her grandfather had cut was for the authorities to allow the family to head into exile. Her father had relatives in the Republic of Mazu, who had granted the Ren use of a country estate before distancing themselves from the family as much as they could without breaking zunyan.

While Song had been raised almost entirely by those born in Jigong, it was not the first time she heard that there was a tinge of the Mazu crispness to her way of speaking. Exile took its toll in small ways as well as the great.

“Is my cabalist in a private room?” she asked, firmly moving away from the subject.

The estate in Mazu had but a small household guard protecting it. It was secrecy that had let it remain untouched, and Song had no intention of speaking on the matter of where exactly she had lived before enrolling in the Watch.

“She is in one of the wards, yes,” the attendant briskly replied. “While there is no guard, only restricted access, you will have to undertake a Judas test before entering after leaving.”

Wise, considering the dangers of possession. Song placed her hand against what appeared to be a nail-sized piece of brumal silver – worth as much as a diamond of the same weight – and waited out the appropriate length of time, casually eyeing the attendant’s open ledger. She glimpsed there the names of Ferranda Villazur and Zenzele Duma writ on different lines, as well as “C. Tred.” appended at the end of those same lines.

As Ferranda was not formally Angharad’s captain, Song realized, the infanzona had likely been refused entry and been forced to seek permission from someone who could grant it. Captain Wen should have been the one consulted, but with Angharad’s own high-ranking uncle present the gray robes must have felt comfortable bending the rules some.

The notion of Ferranda having to jump through some hoops amused, unkind as the thought was. While the other captain had not poached so much as picked up, it had not endeared her to Song either way.

The attendant from Wendi marked an X after Song’s name when the Judas test ended, then declared her free to visit. The directions led her to a ward across the hall and further down than the one where she had been laid to rest after the attack, but it was not a long walk. The door did not make a sound as she cracked it open, well oiled, and neither did it when she closed it behind her.

There was only a single oil lamp lit inside, but Song did not reach for another: it made little difference to her eyes. Laid on the bed was Angharad Tredegar, tucked under her sheets.

Her wrists were tied to the head of the bed by shackles.

Song sighed and slid into the seat to the right of the bed. The other woman was, well… physically she looked mostly fine. A small burn on her palm where the brigade seal had touched flesh and some bruising on the cheeks from when she had been wrestled down onto the ground. Calling what had followed the outing of her possession a brawl would be doing it too much honor.

The parasite in her mind had bade her to run and she had, but Song shouting about possession mobilized a garden’s worth of students in a heartbeat and Angharad was wrestled down without truly fighting back – she’d not been so far gone as to turn on watchmen. Save for some attempts to buck those holding her down, the Pereduri had given them little trouble before the garrison arrived to seize her.

Whatever the officers had done after taking her away, though, left marks: her face was wan, her expression sickly and she covered in old sweat. No visible wounds, but how much did that really mean when dealing with an aether entity? The door was soundless, so it was the change in the air that tipped off Song – her hand reaching for her pistol by reflex, until she caught sight of a black coat and forced herself to pull it away.

The stranger stepped through, raising an eyebrow.

“Ancestors, it’s dark in here,” the man who could only be Commander Osian Tredegar said. “Light another lamp, would you?”

“Sir,” she said, rising to her feet and saluting.

“This isn’t a parade ground, at ease,” the man snorted. “The lamp, yes?”

Song swiftly got to it, sneaking a look at Angharad’s uncle from the side as she reached for the matches. The two Tredegars only shared some looks – mostly the nose – but the ring on Osian’s hand bearing the two-tailed snake of House Tredegar confirmed the relation. He was, Song noted, taller than Angharad and in fine shape for an Umuthi. Very fine shape, she noticed, eyes lingering on those broad shoulders. That finely cut beard lent him the look of a distinguished older man, and he had an easy smile.

A smile currently directed at her, because she had been caught looking.

Clearing her throat and looking away with burning cheeks, Song lit a second oil lamp and tried not to turn into cinders from sheer mortification.

“Sit,” Commander Tredegar invited, still smiling. “As her captain, you are entitled to know of her health.”

Song slid back into her seat, yet feeling like she should be snapping a salute as she did.

“I am surprised to see her still bound,” she admitted.

“Standard procedure after possession,” Osian Tredegar dismissed as he settled in a seat on the other side of his niece. “Tomorrow they will test her again with brumal silver to confirm she is free of the parasite, but there is no expectation that anything remains.”

“Glad news,” Song said, and meant it.

“Some of the few to come out of this mess,” the older man sighed. “You have my thanks for acting when you did, Captain Ren. It was a… close shave, I have since been made to understand.”

Song almost winced. A close shave with an aether parasite was sure to leave marks even if you survived it.

“Yes, that is about the right reaction,” Commander Tredegar agreed, seeing through her restraint. “The dollmaker did a number on her: she will not be able to walk without help for weeks and it will take weeks more before she is anywhere near a fighting fit.”

She raised an eyebrow.

“That may cause difficulties with her Skiritai class,” Song said.

“Between the coming departure for Asphodel and her having psychosomatic wounds, she will be exempt from the monster-fighting,” Osian Tredegar said.

There was enough confidence in his voice that the should sounded like a will, which Song was aggrieved to admit she found rather attractive. He probably did not even write poetry, she told herself. There was no need to admire him too much.

“I expect Marshal de la Tavarin will find something else to occupy her,” she said, definitely not blushing.

“No doubt,” Commander Tredegar agreed. “The man’s dossier has more seals stamped on than a tourney board and any Skiritai that lives past sixty has a record to make Ramayan novels seem tame.”

Song made a disgusted moue at the mention of those things masquerading as literature. The Yellow Earth was right to try and have them banned, they were blatant propaganda: the ‘charming’ Ramayan captains always ended up tumbling doe-eyed, beautiful Tianxi maidens from an old noble family dispossessed by wicked, greedy revolutionary merchants. Which were not at all like the virtuous, appropriately money-oriented Ramayan merchants exalted by such tales.

Even worse, the authors cribbed from each other’s monologues. Song could forgive propaganda but not plagiarism.

“A fearful thing to consider,” she drily replied.

He smirked, settling more comfortably in his seat, and did not deny it.

“It was good of you to come and visit,” Commander Tredegar told her.

His tone sounded approving, which she did not think warranted.

“I am still her captain,” Song said.

“On paper,” the older man said, then cocked an eyebrow. “I must admit that Angharad was rather vague on the reasons why she believes there must be a parting of ways between you. What happened?”

Song’s lips thinned. In principle, she did not have to answer that question. While Osian Tredegar was a superior officer, he was not her superior officer. He would be when they left for Asphodel, however, so even had she been truly reluctant to tell him she would have been wary of poisoning the well.

“We had a disagreement over the death of Lady Isabel Ruesta,” she finally said. “It took place back on the Dominion but she since learned details of it.”

The dark-skinned man frowned, though not at her. He was fighting to recall the name, and after a few moments the frown went away.

“The infanzona with the borderline contract,” Osian Tredegar said. “Some sort of supernatural charm?”

Song nodded. Close enough. It was interesting to hear that Isabel Ruesta had been marked as an edge case. Mind control contracts were forbidden under the Iscariot Accords, but the Accords’ throughline was that they should govern only supernatural matters – and the most insidious part of Isabel’s contract, how it trained perception, was not something forced on by the contracted god.

The contract helped setting that perception, certainty, but it did not force it onto a mind. To declare it illegal on that basis would have been difficult, given that purely mundane social maneuvering could achieve much the same effect.

“She took a bullet to the head,” the silver-eyed woman mildly replied.

Commander Tredegar snorted.

“Well, these things happen when you go around using charm contracts on people,” he said, then raised an eyebrow. “I take it my niece was involved with Lady Ruesta?”

“Despite every attempt at fostering better judgment, yes,” Song darkly replied.

To her surprise, she was faced with what appeared to be genuine sympathy.

“Her mother had dreadful taste in lovers as well,” Osian Tredegar sighed. “Angharad comes by it honestly.”

He paused.

“Given the fool gallantry that infects Peredur like an honorable outbreak of the clap, I expect my niece would take poorly to a woman she was courting having an accident.”

“You seem indifferent to the notion,” Song observed.

“If the Ruesta girl was using a contract on Angharad, I’m more likely to give a medal than a reprimand to whoever put an end to it,” Commander Tredegar said.

Though there was an implicit invitation there, Song kept silent. After a moment, the dark-skinned man inclined his head in acknowledgement. He would not press the matter and she had no intention of speaking further on it.

“Despite your disagreement,” he said, “she seems to believe staying with the Thirteenth for Asphodel is the wisest course.”

“She implied as much,” Song warily said. “We were discussing terms when I noticed the discrepancies in her behavior.”

Commander Tredegar grunted in acknowledgement, and she was glad he did not ask any further. It was to his honor that the man knew where to draw the line in where to meddle – while the commander could have forced Song to take in his niece without any terms at all, the Tianxi would have been rather soured on the affair if he had.

“Regardless of where that matter falls, I am to give you a hand in the coming months,” Osian Tredegar said. “Colonel Zhuge arranged for my appointment as the Umuthi instructor, which grants me some influence in choosing which brigade will get which assignment when we reach Asphodel. You will be provided the opportunity to choose when the time comes.”

“You have my thanks,” Song said, inclining her head.

He smiled thinly.

“I have no intention of ever crossing Shilin Zhuge,” he said. “He might have that scholarly Tianxi pleasantness down to an art, girl, but he also puts up on his wall the calligraphy of rivals whose careers he buried.”

Commander Tredegar leaned.

“However polite it may be, it is still a row of bloody scalps.”

Now that was uncalled for. It was only proper for a respected scholar to display calligraphy and reflect on the hand of those encountered. She cleared her throat.

“One’s handwriting reveals much of one’s character, and thus helps grasp their virtues and flaws,” Song said, a tad reproachfully.

Just a tad. He was still a commander.

“So the Tianxi claim, yes,” Osian Tredegar drawled. “I must confess to a degree of skepticism on the matter.”

He dismissed the conversation with a wave of the hand before she could reply, rising to his feet.

“I have already taken up too much of your time,” he said. “I will leave you to your visit.”

“That is kind of you,” Song said.

Part of her was considering if she should stay longer than she had first planned since he might be there to pay attention to the length of the visit. Perhaps she should have brought a book. The tall man slowed by the door, then half-turned with an idle look on his face.

“Oh, one last thing,” Commander Tredegar said. “I am curious – do you have any notion of why my niece might have entered a layer?”

She blinked in surprise.

“None,” Song said. “She would not have done so on purpose, I expect: another of the Thirteenth entered a layer by accident, earlier this term, and in the aftermath our Navigator made it very clear how dangerous it is.”

She cocked her head to the side.

“Is that where she encountered the mara?”

“We cannot know for sure before she wakes,” Osian Tredegar precisely replied, but his face was grim.

He inclined his head.

“Thank you for your time, Captain Ren.”

“And yours, commander,” she murmured, returning the gesture.

The door closed behind him with nary a sound and her silver eyes flicked to his niece’s sleeping form as silence settled on the room. What have you been up to, Angharad?

Song Ren found she had no idea, and that worried her more than she cared to admit.

—

Angharad woke with a headache drumming against the inside of her skull.

She groaned, her body throbbing with a dull pain settled deepest in her bones. Eyes fluttering open, she found herself looking at a stone ceiling bathed in lantern light – she tried to get up, but the muscles of her midriff were like jelly. She twitched once, then fell back onto the pillows propping her up. A hand came to rest on her forehead.

“Easy now.”

She craned her neck to the left, but it was as if she were watching through a looking glass. She blinked forcefully, feeling filth caked up on the corner of the eye, and the vagueness came into focus. Osian Tredegar was standing over her. There were dark circles around his eyes. Angharad tried to speak up but her mouth was dry at sand. She licked at her cracked lips, but it helped nothing. She coughed.

“Wait a moment,” Uncle Osian said.

He leaned back while Angharad’s tongue sought the wet of her own spit, trying to remember how she had ended up here. It came to her after a heartbeat. The layer, the ambush. Song drawing a pistol on her, then the distant recollection of ripping down a curtain of silk and being tackled into a bed of flowers.

 “How long?” she managed to rasp out.

“Three days,” Osian replied, then clicked his tongue. “Lean back a little.”

She obeyed as best she could, even that small movement difficult. He poured the water into her mouth, gently, and part of her could not help but think of that woman in the layer. What had her name been? Miren. Miren, she’d been called. Angharad drank down gulp after gulp until he eased off the skin, then licked her lips. They were just as cracked as before, only wet. She leaned back down into the bed, letting out a rattling sigh.

“My bones hurt,” she got out.

“It is a psychosomatic injury,” Uncle Osian told her. “Your bones have not been physically hurt, but the damage done to your soul is resonating with your body.”

A pause.

“Bones and aching are good signs,” he added. “Sharp, localized pain is often the herald of permanent damage.”

Angharad swallowed.

“What happened?”

“Captain Ren figured out you were possessed and called on help to wrestle you down until the garrison could take you into custody,” her uncle said. “The first purging attempt went poorly, so you were drowned before a second was made.”

Her fingers clawed into the sheets.

“Drowned?”

“In sea water,” he added, as if that were the part that mattered. “A temporary measure, Angharad. You were immediately resuscitated, as is done with sailors. It weakened the mara enough it could be expunged without… drastic measures.”

“Drowning is not drastic?” she asked.

“No,” he mildly said. “It is not the silver casket, or trepanation. Count yourself lucky the parasite did not have longer to burrow into you, else there would have been no choice but to use these.”

Angharad’s eyes were weak, everything out of her direct stare trembling, but that mildness warned her and watching her uncle’s face confirmed it: he was furious. A tight, contained sort of fury but fury nonetheless.

“Uncle?” she asked.

“I am told,” Osian continued with a forceful calm, “that the entrance wound into your soul was unusually neat. Such injuries, I am again told, usually occur when the soul is attacked while outside its mortal shell. As it would be when walking a layer.”

She swallowed. The urge was there to walk the line, try to dance around with words, but she pushed it down. Angharad could barely even think straight, and he was owed better anyhow.

“The Witching Hour,” she admitted. “It felt like a small cut, nothing more. I did not know my opponents were maras.”

Was that why they had moved so strangely? It must be why they had vanished after scoring a single blow, anyhow. Commander Osian Tredegar leaned back his chair, face calm as a windless pond but his dark eyes burning.

“Do you know what a mara does to someone, when given time?”

She weakly shook her head.

“To enter it first takes a bite of your soul,” Uncle Osian said. “Then it presses itself into that gape, replacing it, and begins spreading through you like roots.”

His tone was the sort of even that came from forcing yourself not to shout.

“It eats your memories, your very being to spread,” he said. “First the parts that know its existence and how to get rid of it. By then, it has influence enough it can begin to nudge you – urge decisions that are felt to be whims or fancies.”

His fingers drummed against the arm of the chair, just a little too hard to be quiet.

“After that the mara begins eating the parts of you that know how to talk,” Osian said. “Then those that know how to move. When it has that, it will make you head into isolation so it can hollow you out entirely away from witnesses.”

He closed his eyes.

“Men call the creatures dollmakers because that is what returns afterwards: a doll moved around by the mara, passing as whom it used to be while the parasite looks for its next prey.”

The fingers had ceased drumming. Now they were clutching the end of the armchair, hard enough it creaked in protest.

“What in bloody-handed Branwen were you thinking, girl?” he snarled. “Heading into a layer on your own, without a Navigator or so much as an ally to pick you up should you be unable to walk home afterwards. Are youtrying to get yourself killed?”

Angharad looked away. She was not a child, to be chided so.

“It went fine, until the very end,” she said.

“You were fucking hours away from no longer knowing how to talk, Angharad,” Osian half-shouted, then closed his eyes.

He took a deep breath, ripped his hands off the chair and closed them into fists before setting back down gently. His teeth were clenched when he began talking again, but his voice had lowered.

“If your captain had not, with admirable wits, caught on to your situation you would currently have all the vocabulary of ten-year-old child,” Osian said.

She looked down at the hands in her lap.

“I underestimated the risks,” she admitted.

“You overestimated yourself,” he harshly corrected. “As things stand, it might well be months before you cease having shaking fits. Even when you grow able to stand you will require the use of cane.”

She breathed in sharply, panic rising.

“But it is not…”

“Permanent?” Osian finished. “No, lucky you. The senior Akelarre in port lent a hand and tricked the mara into leaving with only minor damage. Some memory loss was inevitable the moment it ate part of your soul and your wits will remain fragile for a few days yet, but most of the damage was psychosomatic. When the mara ripped itself out of your soul, it was not gentle.”

Angharad bit her lip. Part of her felt like weeping, if only out of frustration. At having lost things she would not even remember, but worse yet at what it meant that she would be unable to move around without a cane. She could not head back into the Witching Hour. To try that dark night without being able to run was suicide in long form.

And as that realization did sink it, she closed her eyes and let her head sink into the pillow.

She swallowed the sob, for what good would it do? This was it, then. She had failed so utterly she could not even try again. Her last chance of seeing her father, of ever freeing him, had just slipped through her fingers because she was the sort of fool to hesitate when shown the same face twice in a dream. The sounds that ripped themselves out of her stole the wind out of her uncle’s sail. She heard him sight, and when she opened his eyes he was rubbing at the bridge of his nose.

He looked as exhausted as she felt: another failure for the pile.

“Why?” he tiredly asked. “Tell me that, at least. Why did you insist on going gallivanting through a murderous aether nightmare? You entered through the same passage as the boy in your brigade, it was not a coincidence.”

“I-”

Cannot was on her lips, but it would be a lie.

“It was not for me,” she finally choked out. “But on the behest of another.”

Her uncle’s eyes hardened.

“No teacher would be fool enough to send you into a layer so unprepared,” he said. “Who?”

“I was not forced,” Angharad said.

“That does not mean you were not leveraged,” he flatly replied. “Who, Angharad?”

She lowered her gaze.

“It might be unwise to say,” she got out.

There was a long moment of silence, then Osian Tredegar softly cursed.

“It’s the ufudu, isn’t it? This all reeks to Hell of the Lefthand House.”

It was over, then. Even the suspicion was enough to finish this. She was finished. What point was there in hiding anything now, in even trying to lie? Angharad swallowed, then nodded. She felt so sick to the stomach that if she spoke she would start to throw up and never stop.

“They shouldn’t have anything on you that,” he began, then stopped. “Llanw Hall. Someone survived. They stole someone out of the ashes?”

“Father still lives,” she croaked. “I was shown a drawing of him with an arm missing. But uncle he’s – they tell me he’s kept in Tintavel.”

Beyond the Watch’s reach. Beyond everyone but the Lefthand House’s.

“Gwydion,” Osian Tredegar said, speaking the name like it was the worst sort of curse. “Of course Gwydion survived it all and now comes back to haunt us all. I should have bloody known.”

“The Watch can’t get me into the Black Mountain,” Angharad desperately said. “But the Lefthand House-”

He cut her off with a sharp gesture.

“Will deliver just enough of what they promised you to keep you on the hook and never a drop more,” Osian said. “To them things are most profitable with your father inside Tintavel and you willing to do most anything to get him out.”

“You think I don’t know that?” Angharad snarled back. “I’m not a fool, uncle, I know I can’t trust the ufudu.”

She clenched her fist.

“But what else is there?” she desperately. “What else am I supposed to do, just leave him to die in there? I can see no other way. Crooks they may be, but they are the only ones offering.”

“What did they ask you to do?” Osian asked.

She hesitated.

“Child,” he gently said, “either you can tell me now or we can have that conversation with a Mask in the room.”

She licked her cracked lips.

“The Infernal Forge,” Angharad said. “The one the Lightbringer is said to have tossed into the aether when Tolomontera fell to the Watch.”

“Of all the raving lunacies,” her uncle said, rubbing at his forehead, then frowned. “No, no. Of course the High Queen is after one, word is the Krypteia smashed her last a few years back. The ufudu are even toeing the lines of the Iscariot Accords – they’re not taking the device, they’re coming into its possession.”

Angharad frowned, lost.

“What do the Accords have to do with this?” she asked.

“Having Infernal Forges is forbidden under them, save for those in the Watch’s vaults and those within the walls of Pandemonium,” Osian said. “But the wording had to be careful, for many were hidden in the wake of the Second Empire’s fall  and no power would agree to unknowing possession being an Accords breach. Else having one buried in your countryside could get you interdicted.”

“So it is allowed?” she slowly said.

“No,” he said. “Having one in your nation’s ‘possession’ is not illegal but using them, studying them, hiding them and seeking to obtain an Infernal Forge is.”

Angharad blinked, confounded.

“But I am being solicited for this task,” she said, “surely…”

“Surely, if proof ever emerges of it, the High Queen will apologize for the actions of a cell of rogue ufudu and execute those involved as an apology,” Uncle Osian said. “If the Forge makes it to a hidden facility, she will line up some minor noble ‘aiming to usurp her’ to take the fall and lose his head should the Krypteia sniff out the lair and bring proof of its existence too solid to deny.”

Now she felt sick in an entirely different way.

“That is obscene,” she said.

“It has happened at least twice I know of,” Osian replied. “Not in my lifetime, but the last was as recent as the second decade of the Century of Sails.”

Not even a hundred years ago.

“It is the Queen Perpetual herself who signed the Iscariot Accords,” Angharad insisted. “With her own hand. The sheer dishonor of breaking her own word…”

“Oh, she ever respects her word,” Osian mildly said. “Only sometimes her subjects do not. Out of her sight, of course, and she rectifies this when it is brought to her attention. What else can be asked of her?”

Angharad opened her mouth to object, but the older man gestured curtly.

“We can have that talk some other time, when the both of us are better rested,” he said. “The ufudu is the one that sent you into the layer?”

“They said the Infernal Forge should be in one of them,” Angharad said.

“It might well be,” Osian said, “but you are unsuited to finding it. A sword only gets you so far in a layer. Navigators are the answer and they have tried and failed to obtain the Forge in the years Scholomance was closed. Although…”

He frowned.

“Aether responds to strong emanations,” Osian said. “A focused enough sense of need could have served as a compass of sorts. One growing stronger the more urgent the need became. Were you given a date?”

“The end of the year,” Angharad quietly said.

She bit her lip. It was out now, but part of her could not help but tremble at what was yet to come. But there was a wild hope, that her uncle might help her through her failure. If he lent a hand, surely…

“Uncle, I know I cannot-”

“No,” he coldly cut, “you cannot. I will not turn my back on my oaths to the Watch and ignore this.”

Horrible as that end was, there was also some relief. It was out of her hands, now.

“I will confess it all, then,” she tiredly said.

“Had you done anything worth confessing, that would be good of you,” Osian mildly said. “But you have not. The worst you can be accused of is not immediately reporting an agent of the Lefthand House, but that is not against the rules on Tolomontera.”

“So you want me to… cease,” she said.

He eyed her for a long moment.

“I could ask,” he said. “But you won’t, will you?”

Her fists clenched, however weakly. Angharad said nothing. It was better than lying.

“If you return to the layer in this state, you will die,” he plainly said.

“Then I will arrange for others to do so on my behalf,” she replied. “Beg and bargain as I must.”

“That will also get you killed,” Osian said. “It will make its way to someone who will look into it – either some Mask student looking to pass their class, or some Stripe looking to raise their score. You will be a commendation on their record by year’s end.”

She gritted her teeth.

“I cannot just abandon my father to die in a cell,” Angharad told him. “I know it would be wiser, uncle, the clever thing to do. But it is not who I am.”

She breathed out.

“I have only weeks until I must leave,” she said, “and while on Asphodel my search will have to end. I cannot-”

“That,” Osian Tredegar softly said, “is not entirely true.”

Her eyes fell on him, light as a feather. He passed a hand through his hair.

“That cache found on Asphodel,” he said. “It is suspected to include an Infernal Forge, though the Rectorate has not reported as much.”

Angharad swallowed.

“You mean…”

“I will not turn on the black, not even for my blood,” Osian said. “But were it to be obtained from the Rectorate instead, that would be… a pill I can swallow.”

“You mean it?” she breathed out.

His expression hardened.

“Do not pin hopes on this,” Osian Tredegar said. “I will report suspicions that the Lefthand House got their hands on a Forge the moment their agents sail with it. That is as far as I will to bend, and ancestors willing the Second Fleet will catch that ship on its way back to Malan.”

He grimaced.

“But as far as that, I will help you,” he said.

“Thank you,” Angharad almost wept. “Truly, uncle, there are no words-”

“Do not thank me too soon,” he quietly said. “For this I want an oath of you.”

She leaned in, so quick it hurt her tender neck.

“Never again,” Osian said, “will you ask me to bend my oath to the Watch, or do the same.”

Slowly she nodded.

“And whoever that ufudu is?” he said. “We will cut their throat when the business is done. I’ll not have the sickness spreading any further.”

A few weeks ago, Angharad might have balked at that. No longer.

“I will wield the blade myself, when the time comes,” she promised.

Osian breathed out.

“All right, then,” he said. “Tell me everything.”

She did.

# Chapter 39

Angharad found herself, against her will, spellbound by the sight of Captain Wen Duan eating an apple.

Not for any messiness or lack of manners but because he was shaving slices off it, one small bit at a time, and popping them into his mouth – without looking at his hands or paying attention to either the apple or the folding knife. It was like looking at a man walking the edge of a cliff in a windstorm. Surely, any moment now, Wen would cut himself. That he stubbornly did not was impressive, but also frustrating in some abstract away.

“You know, I’d be miffed about your uncle throwing his weight around the Thirteenth so much if he weren’t bribing me again,” Captain Wen said.

Angharad grimaced, which was about the only thing she could do without collapsing in exhaustion afterwards these days. She had tried to raise a cup of water this morning and it’d felt like her fingers were made of rubber. She’d barely been able to grasp the cup, much less move it.

“Surely,” she tried, “it is merely a gift of thanks for your-”

“Nah, it was pretty bribe-shaped,” Wen mused. “It’s not like he just slid me a bag of gold under the table, he’s a classy man your uncle, but it had those definite bribe characteristics. I should know, those were the only good thing about the Dominion. The frequent probes are what senior officers use to sell the assignment to suckers who volunteer for the tour.”

Angharad choked.

“You mean to say that the Watch knows about bribes on the Dominion,” she said. “That they allow this?”

“It’s official policy, even,” Wen said. “You just have to report them. That way the infanzones keep sending their little darlings, certain that pouring gold into our pockets will give their brats an edge to survive and come back covered in glory.”

It was a relief to learn that Uncle Osian might not have broken the law by paving her way on the Dominion, although Angharad was leery at the notion of any involvement with bribes. Hypocrite, she chided herself. You sneer at gold when you’ve been bought and sold with promises thin as air. Eager to leave that dark thought behind, she cleared her throat.

“Thank you for visiting, Captain Wen,” she said.

The corpulent Tianxi narrowly avoided carving out a tenth of his thumb, instead producing a thin slice of apple he swallowed with a pleased smack of the lips.

“I’m patron to the Thirteenth,” he shrugged. “Which you are still part of, as far as I know.”

She grimaced again.

“That uncertainty,” Angharad delicately said, “is why I wished to speak with you. While I had been considering transferring to another brigade, the situation has changed.”

Another miraculous dodge, another slice of apple.

“Heard about that,” Captain Wen agreed. “A motion that went through all the hoops, even passed a vote in the Conclave. Someone must have called in pretty juicy favors for that.”

He paused.

“So now you’re stuck on the boat you were hoping to leave and you’re coming to me to…”

He squinted at her through those gold-rimmed glasses.

“To learn what has been going on since you started rooming with the Thirty-First, I’m guessing.”

“That is not inaccurate,” Angharad admitted. “I know only rumors of what happened with the Forty-Ninth, or even of the assault on Song. It appears reconciliation took place in my absence.”

Which had her jaw clenching, just a little bit. If there had been such grace and artfulness to be found in the brigade, why had it only made an appearance after she left? Was she truly so disliked none of them found it worth trying when she’d still had a foot in the cottage? Wen narrowly saved the side his forefinger from a rather nasty scrape, chewing on his slice.

“Could be,” the large man said.

Angharad patiently waited, but all he did was shave off another piece and eat it.

“If you might elaborate,” she said.

“I won’t,” Wen Duan bluntly told her. “You misunderstand what I am to you, Tredegar. I am not your informant, and my taking your uncle’s coin does not mean I am beholden to you in any way. If you want to know what the others have been up to, ask them.”

He leaned in.

“If you want advice, I’ll give it,” Wen said. “If you need a message passed it’ll be, well, not a pleasure but something I can probably pawn off to Mandisa so close enough. You are not owed a thing more.”

Angharad grit her teeth.

“I did not mean to imply-”

“No, but you did nonetheless,” he easily cut through. “Choke it down and keep moving, kid.”

He carved up a shallow bit of apple, the tip of the knife whispering against a nail, and took up the piece.

“Anything else?”

Angharad breathed in and closed her eyes. There was throbbing in the back of her head, near the nape, but the headache was a constant companion now. Part of her wanted to wait longer to pursue this, until she was further down the road to recovery. She had only revealed it all to her uncle last night, there were still over two weeks left before the ship to Asphodel departed. But that voice was the part of her flinching away from the work, from the embarrassment of the necessities that yet lay before her.

So Angharad swallowed her pride, well aware she would be getting used to that taste over the coming days.

“I would ask for advice,” she finally said.

“Never pair a Lanka red with monkfish,” Wen replied without batting an eye. “It feels light enough when you try the bottle, but it isn’t. Spoils the taste completely.”

It insulted her Pereduri pride somewhat to have let him spring that on her.

“On the matter of resuming a place in the Thirteenth, more specifically,” Angharad said.

“Ah, that,” he smiled. “I’ll tell you, then, that the real meat of that situation is a choice you have yet to make.”

Wen Duan pushed his glasses back up his nose.

“Are you trying to return for Asphodel, or for good?” he asked. “Either way you’ll need to sit down with Song, but those would be different conversations.”

Asphodel, Angharad almost replied, but she held her tongue. To speak in haste was rarely wise.

“Do you believe she would be inclined to accept a temporary arrangement?” she asked instead.

“Not without you coughing something up,” Wen bluntly said. “You had two selling points, Angharad: your sword hand and your connections. The way I hear it, the hand’s going to be on the mend and she gets to lean on your connections regardless. What is it that you bring to the table?”

“I will recover in time,” Angharad said. “By the time we leave for Asphodel I will be able to walk with a cane, and depending on how long we stay there-”

There she gave him a quizzical glance, hoping for an answer.

“Depends on your test and how quickly you finish it,” Captain Wen said. “Could be a week, could be months.”

Angharad’s lips thinned. A week on Asphodel after a few days on a ship – the Rectorate was not far from Tolomontera, accounting for fair winds – would not be enough for her to meaningfully recover. A month more and she would be largely back in good health, they had told her, but before that… Straining herself too early might well extend the length of her convalescence.

“I am not sure what I can offer in trade,” she admitted.

“So think on that, then, before you face Song,” Wen said. “It’d be best for you to abandon any notion of you having the larger end of the stick.”

He gave her a look that was hard to decipher.

“That episode with the mara did no wonders for your reputation,” the bespectacled captain said. “You might be on shakier footing than you think.”

Angharad licked her lips.

“What is being said?”

“That you acted the fool, and nearly got yourself killed,” he said, folding the knife and pushing himself up. “Neither of which is untrue.”

Wen bit into the remains of his apple, scarfing the juicy flesh down and swallowing it in a great gulp.

“You’re still on a visitor limit for the next few days, to avoiding straining you,” he said. “Do you want the Thirty-First added to the list of those allowed? Several visited while you were unconscious.”

“Please do,” Angharad replied.

He nodded, then idly tossed the apple core into the empty chamber pot in the corner of the room. He had a deft hand at that, she noted, for a man wearing spectacles.

“It’s not the end of it all, being on the back foot,” Captain Wen told her. “It’s where most everyone starts, Angharad. You’ll find a way to muddle on.”

Angharad mutely thanked him and he nodded back, strolling out of the room. The noblewoman collapsed back down onto her pillows the moment he left, closing her eyes as a ram pounded against the inside of her skull. Even conversation was tiring, these days, but she dared not sleep, not until she had found something she might bargain with the Thirteenth with.

It was a long day of chasing dead ends after that, and a long night.

—

Tristan had seen murders whose aftermath was less grisly.

He’d put up the scarecrow at the edge of the field, planting the pole deep in the ground and crossing it with a long branch at shoulder height. The head was a ball of cloth filled with straw and the cheapest hat he could find– a simple cap – but he’d clothed his masterpiece in a loose brown tunic with tied up bundles of straw shoved under to fill up the frame. It had been very convincing, in his opinion.

Not to the magpie, apparently, because it had gutted the thing.

The scarecrow had been brutally decapitated, his head on the ground bearing the marks of having been pecked open thought the cloth. Straw peeked out mournfully through these holes. The cap had been pulled off, ripped up around the edges and abandoned in the dirt. Worse was the fate of the scarecrow’s body: eviscerated, the tunic carved open at the belly with straw spilling out on the ground like entrails.

For that to have happened, Tristan knew, the strings keeping the straw bundles together would have needed to be pecked open. This… outrage was not mere happenstance: he was being sent a message.

“I don’t see any seeds,” Maryam said, taking a bite from her apple.

She chewed as loudly and obnoxiously as she could. Tristan frowned. It was true, none of the seeds he had sown that morning remained. As last time, the bird had been meticulous in removing them all.

“I know,” he said.

She swallowed, loudly.

“I don’t think your scarecrow idea worked, Tristan,” Maryam opined.

“I know,” Tristan replied through gritted death.

He pulled down at his tunic to hide his irritation. This was but a setback.

“I have only just begun,” Tristan Abrascal announced. “If I have to bribe Ferranda’s own tinker to make me traps, then by the Manes I will.”

He turned to glare at the cottage rooftop.

“Your days are counted, bird,” he called out. “This is far from over.”

He was a dignified man, so he did not shake his fist. This restraint was rewarded by the reveal of his enemy: on the rooftops there was a flicker of movement, dark feathers on tiles, and then an answering birdcall. It was the sound a door hinge would make if it could cackle.

“Yeah?” he grunted. “Well, let’s see how you outwit the latest traps out of Tianxia then.”

A rusty cackle gave answer.

“I think this might be my favorite thing to have happened all year,” Maryam confessed.

—

Captain Tozi Poloko held the kind of contract that nobles waged private wars to control.

While Song had never before heard of the Three Hundred Ninety-Ninth Brother, the god could not be a trifling one: it was no small boon, granting Captain Tozi the power to discern the most likely source of her death for the next three hours. It was a boon contract on top of that, so the Izcalli would not need to pay every time she looked for her death.

The price was not particularly onerous either, for someone of means anyway. Tozi Poloko was to raise a shrine to the Three Hundred Ninety-Ninth Brother every year until her death, but the Centzon word used could also mean ‘altar’. The implication there, Song thought, was that it did not have to be a particularly large shrine.

“Our patron will be teaching Teratology while we are on the Gallant Enterprise,” Captain Tozi said, as she broke the chicken bone with her bare hands and eased off the meat. “It is unclear to me if these lessons will continue while on Asphodel.”

In search of a cheap, private eatery with decent food Song had reached out to the finest source at her disposal and been recommended by Captain Wen the ‘Thirteenth Poultrayal’, a Lierganen rotisserie with one of the most audaciously blasphemous names she’d ever heard of. The owner was a taciturn, scarred man with a hook hand who could roast a fine chicken but categorically refused to put oil in all his lanterns or fix the chairs so they’d stop wobbling.

The lighting inside was flickering and smelled faintly of olives, though that did nothing to hinder a woman with eyes like Song’s from taking in the sight of Tozi Poloko.

The Izcalli was short and slender, almost boyish, and her haircut only strengthened the impression – shaved, save for a narrow, raised stripe of hair going all the way down her back and two small spots above her ears. The mark of Izcalli nobility, of the warrior kind: the cuachic was an honor granted to highborn who’d distinguished themselves in a flower war. The spots being there meant Tozi was descended from such a warrior but had not fought in such a flower war herself.

An elaborate and eye-catching hairdo, which along with the studs in her lips and nose did much heavy lifting in drawing the eye away from small, wet eyes and severe eyebrows.

“They will, though not as regularly,” Song replied. “Our own patron told me as much when he mentioned he will be teaching Saga over the journey.”

Captain Tozi popped a piece of chicken into her mouth, looking thoughtful as she chewed. She’d ordered half of one and torn into it happily, Song satisfying herself with chicken bone broth and what might just be the worst tea she’d ever drunk.

“I expect all four patrons will be instructors, then,” Tozi said. “I know the Eleventh’s patron is a Savant, I don’t suppose you know who’s behind the Fourth?”

“Their man is a Navigator,” Song told her. “A lieutenant by the name of Mitra.”

Tristan apparently had a source inside the Fourth Brigade willing to pass some information, so Song had in turn passed the Mask a list of questions. It was unfortunate that Maryam’s inquiries to Captain Yue about where this Lieutenant Mitra stood in the Akelarre internal hierarchy had been turned away, but then the signifiers were known to prize secrecy.

“Theology for the Navigator and Mandate for the Peiling Society robe, then,” Captain Tozi mused. “I wonder if they’ll send us a Skiritai or a Stripe to cover Warfare.”

Song was inclined to believe it would be a Skiritai, since any Stripe important enough to be sent with a diplomatic delegation to Asphodel was likely to have better use for their time than teaching classes. Mostly likely whoever was sent to train the Skiritai students would double up and teach Warfare on the side.

The Thirteenth, Nineteenth and Eleventh all numbered four students – while the Fourth numbered five, as it was in Tupoc’s very nature to be contrary – so seventeen Scholomance students would be sailing to Asphodel. Every covenant was sure to have at least one representative among the students sent, meaning every covenant would need to either send a teacher or charge one of the brigade patrons with that duty.

“Have you heard anything of the tests awaiting us?” Song idly asked.

She sipped at her terrible tea as Captain Tozi eyed her. Had this even been brewed with tea leaves or just something ripped out of the nearest bush?

“Rumors,” the Izcalli said. “Our patron says there’s sure to be an investigation among them, though. The Rectorate likes to hire the Watch to deal with contract-wielding criminals. Did you hear anything?”

Tozi Poloko had contributed enough unknown information to be worth cultivating as a friendly acquaintance, Song decided, so she cracked open the door a bit.

“I was informed at least one of the tests would take us outside the capital and into the countryside,” she said. “At a guess, an exorcism contract.”

The brown-eyed Izcalli grimaced, as well she should. Exorcism contracts were about removing an aether intellect’s influence from a physical area, and while they were not necessarily dangerous they had a reputation for being unpredictable. Those hiring the Watch usually could not tell the difference between a piece of an old god gathering strength or a lesser spirit that’d gorged on aether and decided to make mischief.

It meant taking exorcism contracts was like rolling dice. Uncle Zhuge had advised to avoid them unless she put together a brigade particularly skilled with such matters, which Song had not. While she had a Navigator, she lacked a Savant skilled in the relevant areas.

“Here’s hoping that the Leopard Society prick gets the short straw, then,” Captain Tozi drily said.

“I will raise a cup to that,” Song fervently agreed, and did.

—

“There,” Captain Yue said. “Try it on.”

It did not look like much, at first glance. A brass ring, a wide flat band. A closer look revealed, however, that there was a stripe going across the middle of the length. Etched cryptoglyphs, so small Maryam’s eyes could barely make them out – and her mind struggled to comprehend them where she could. The Izvorica did not even need to extend her nav to feel the conceptual symmetry laid there, like a subtle steel grip.

“What do they mean?” she asked instead of obeying.

“We don’t know,” Yue admitted. “Only around half of Antediluvian cryptoglyphs are understood, and no find ever allowed us to make out the meaning of these.”

“But you know the effect,” Maryam guessed.

“I do,” Captain Yue said, “and so will you. When you put it on.”

She plucked the ring from the unnecessarily ceremonious cushion it had been placed on, warily trailing her thumb down the length of the cryptoglyphs. They felt cool to the touch, like a pond come spring. Sliding it on, Maryam braced herself for something that never came. Moments passed.

“It had no effect,” she said.

“It’s not a magic ring, Maryam,” Yue said, rolling her eyes. “It is a device. Wrap your nav around it, as a string.”

Cheeks slightly flushed, she did. Now Maryam felt… something. There was some sort of conceptual symmetry at work but besides being felt it did not appear to, well, do anything. She wrapped her nav in a string around the ring three times before turning to her mentor with a cocked eyebrow.

“Stop,” Captain Yue said. “Now pull your nav back.”

Maryam frowned at pulled with her mind, as if to unwind the bob of nav she had woven around the ring, only the ring held the nav firmly in place. She stilled in surprise.

“Ah, so it works,” Yue grinned.

“What is this?” she breathed out.

“I’ve decided to call them rake-rings,” Captain Yue said. “Think of the ring as a gear that turns only one way. When the nav is pulled away from you, it gets stuck in the teeth. Take off the ring and your nav is released.”

“So long as I have it on, it prevents the entity from pulling at the nav I’ve woven around the ring,” Maryam quietly said, heart beating against her ears. “I would be able to trace Signs with what was bound without interference.”

“It will do more than that,” Yue said with a sly smile. And as this creature is strong, it might break a ring eventually. I’ll have a set made for you and you can weave around them like a pulley, distributing the force.”

The Tianxi grinned.

“Tools,” she said, “are how we took the world from spirits and animals. This is no different.”

Only the name still struck Maryam as odd, for why not call them gear-rings or pulley-rings instead? It was only thinking of a second meaning for rake she put it together.

“And when struggling against the rings the entity will hurt itself on the ‘teeth’,” Maryam said. “Like claws raked across its flesh.”

“Small wounds,” Yue agreed. “Drops of blood for you to swallow.  It won’t be able to help struggling, Maryam, even knowing it’s hurting itself. That is its nature.”

The Izvorica shivered at the light in Captain Yue’s eyes, which was neither cruel nor kind but coldly pleased in the way that a clock might be pleased when its gears ran smoothly. Caring only for the beauty of the function, indifferent to whether a finger was lost fixing the little pieces.

“It will feed itself to you, Maryam, one piece at a time.”

—

It was a pleasant visit, all things told, but to entertain four stretched Angharad’s limits.

Zenzele was the one to notice, leaning to the side and whispering into Ferranda’s ear as Shalini continued gesturing animatedly through her story. The victory of Lindiwe Sarru’s team against a lemure from the Steel list was the talk of Allazei, apparently, and the Someshwari gunslinger had been mightily impressed by the manner of the great chimera’s death – and that there’d been no casualty among Lady Sarru’s team.

“I know the woman they got the grenades from,” Rong contributed when Shalini stopped for a breath. “It cannot be done without dabbling in alchemy – there is a Glare effect – but the formula is supposed to be simple firepowder otherwise. Not all that difficult to make.”

“For a Tinker, perhaps,” Ferranda said. “Besides, I do not believe Angharad will be returning to the Acallar anytime soon.”

“I have had word from the Marshal,” Angharad said. “I am expected to begin attending when I can walk with a cane.”

The infanzona looked horrified.

“To fight?”

Angharad cleared her throat with some embarrassment.

“To serve as a new exercise,” she admitted. “I am to head into the arena and be protected from beasts by a squad.”

A pause.

“Marshal de la Tavarin will grant the right to draw again from the lists to any company that completes the exercise.”

“Oh, that’d be so useful,” Shalini muttered. “Are you allowed to fight at all?”

“Only with firearms, save in the defense of my own life,” Angharad said.

Zenzele cleared his throat from the other side of her bed.

“Interesting as that is, we will soon be expected by Philani at the Dregs,” he said. “You can scheme the details of her return another time, Shalini.”

The woman in question blinked, seemingly surprised, then glanced Angharad’s way. Whatever she saw there had her biting the inside of her cheek.

“Of course,” Shalini said. “I’ll swing by tomorrow, Angharad, my story’s not entirely done anyhow.”

“I will look forward to it,” she smiled.

Zenzele mustered the others out the door like a particularly polite sergeant, but even though she rose to her feet Ferranda did not take her leave. This was not unexpected – there had been talk between them of Angharad joining the Thirty-First, but also of obligations dictating otherwise. The infanzona was owed a resolution to that conversation. A silence stretched out between them, almost tense.

“I hear there was no permanent damage,” Ferranda finally said.

Angharad’s lips thinned.

“It is believed that I lost some memories,” she replied. “A minor loss, the Akelarre called it, but how would I know if it were otherwise?”

It was a fearful thing, to hear you had somehow been made less but would likely never learn exactly how.

“I looked into maras,” Ferranda said. “It could have been much, much worse.”

“That is true enough,” Angharad muttered. “My uncle was… firm in telling me as much.”

“If there was anger, I expect it was born of worry,” the fair-haired infanzona said, crossing her arms. “I truly am glad you were spared the worst, Angharad.”

The Pereduri’s brow creased. That made twice, now. That was the difference between wishing well and preparing the ground.

“You have bad news,” Angharad guessed.

Ferranda Villazur’s face, ever prone to severity, hardened.

“Our talk about your joining the Thirty-First should be considered laid to rest,” she said.

The surprise, Angharad thought, somehow stung worse than the words. She had not thought Ferranda the kind of woman to be moved by the rumors Wen mentioned, but perhaps that was unfair of her. Reputation mattered in Scholomance, Angharad had to acknowledge as much even if some took the obsession too far.

“I must remain with the Thirteenth for several more weeks at least,” she said. “Still, there are yet years ahead of us on this isle.”

“Laid to rest for good, Angharad,” Ferranda flatly corrected.

The noblewoman stilled. For good? That was… No, rumors would not put those words in the infanzona’s mouth. What had happened? Her bafflement must have been obvious, for Ferranda’s jaw clenched at the sight of it.

“You…”

Ferranda’s voice turned cold and clipped.

“Bad enough you headed out into Allazei alone without warning any of us, but that is far from the worst decision you made that night,” she said. “You wandered into a layer, Angharad, had an encounter with a parasite and after being lucky enough not to die outright you brought it back to the house.”

 There was cold anger in Ferranda’s eyes.

“Rong and Zenzele slept mere feet away from a dollmaker and never knew, because you never said a word about it all. If Song had not figured it out we might not have realized anything until the mara attacked one of them in their sleep.”

“I,” Angharad began, then swallowed. “There was-”

She bit her lip. How much could she tell Ferranda without revealing too much?

“You put my cabalists in danger,” the infanzona sharply said. “I do not care what your reasons were, Angharad. If not for a stroke of luck, your ill-considered stunt might well have gotten other people killed.”

Crisply she folded her hands behind her back.

“Recklessness is one thing when it is only your life on the line, but you brought others into the danger you courted. I cannot in good conscience seek to recruit you into the Thirty-First Brigade.”

Angharad swallowed, eyes shying away from the other woman’s burning gaze. She found herself looking down at her lap like a chided child, but how could she resent that when she had no defense to muster? She had… Ferranda was right to be angry. Neither Rong nor Zenzele had cause to pay for the decisions that Angharad had made, was yet making. She had brought trouble to their doorstep and never once warned them of it.

“I understand,” she forced out.

A moment passed, then she heard Ferranda sigh.

“I do not mean to sever all ties between us, Angharad,” she said.

The Pereduri’s head rose and she found the infanzona’s expression had softened the slightest bit.

“I draw a line now so that I need not ever do so again,” Ferranda said. “There can no longer be a question of your sharing a roof or brigade with us, but nothing else need change. I don’t expect Zenzele or Shalini would obey that order even were I inclined to give it.”

No, Angharad thought. Not matter the good intention, it could not be so neat as that. When a clay cup was shattered putting the pieces back together would not also put the water back inside. She had broken the trust extended her, it should not be easy for things to return the way they had been.

“I understand,” she repeated, like a child or a fool.

Ferranda let out a long breath.

“I should have waited longer before telling you,” she finally said. “Zenzele was right.”

Another prick of pain, to hear that Zenzele disagreed not with the word but the time of their speaking.

“No,” Angharad softly replied. “I am glad you did not. If you had visited more than once before telling me it would have felt…”

A lie, in some indescribable way.

“Your affairs are free to remain in the house as long as you wish,” Ferranda said, not. “I understand your ties to the Thirteenth are… uncertain, at the moment.”

The sound Angharad let out at that was half a sob. No matter how long she stared at the walls, she had found nothing that Song and the others might want of her. She closed her eyes, forced herself to calm. To break out weeping before Ferranda would shame them both. The other noblewoman waited in silence until she’d gathered herself, her breath steady even if her eyes still strung.

“Arrogance never really feels like arrogance, does it?” Angharad murmured. “Only like pride, until it breaks on you.”

Ferranda’s eyes were far away. Angharad suspected she knew where, and with whom.

“The gods delight in a well-laid plan,” the infanzona replied. “In that moment before you set out, when you have it all figured it out. It’s what ruins you, I think – being so sure that with a little cleverness, you can have it all.”

The infanzona smiled mirthlessly.

“Fate is a blind and cruel horse,” she said. “It will throw you off when you least expect it.”

“It is not fate that was blind,” Angharad tiredly said.

“Maybe,” Ferranda shrugged. “But what does that change? In the end, when you end up laid on your belly with the breath kicked out of you, there’s only one person who can decide whether you’ll get back on your feet.”

“Is that what you did?” she asked.

Ferranda snorted, looking away.

“I’ll tell you if I ever figure it out,” she said, sounding wistful.

The infanzona’s hand came to rest on the pommel of her rapier.

“A good day to you, Angharad, and my wishes for swift recovery.”

The Pereduri nodded at her listlessly. Ferranda hesitated for the barest instant, then nodded back. The door closed behind her, too soft a sound to echo as part of Angharad wished it might. At least there would have been something clear-cut, a sharp note. Instead she had only half-ends to wrestle with, bastard things that resisted easy definition. Little had changed, she thought, but much had changed around it.

Now the ground beneath her feet was revealed to be sand, and she still did not have a single fucking thing to offer the Thirteenth in a bargain.

What did she even have to her name? Now that Angharad looked back, it felt as if she had been standing on others her whole life. Coin and influence not her own had fed her, clothed her, fetched her the finest teachers and opened the way for her to ply her blade against others. Her skills, her victories, they were her own. That would never change.

But now she could only see that every paving stone on the road she had walked to those victories was set down by another.

Even now, the same uncle who had left Llanw Hall to make something of himself in the Watch was putting it all on the line for her. Using his every great deed, a lifetime’s worth of toil and perhaps even that life itself, as paving stones for Angharad’s road. It was an odious thing, to see how much she had taken and taken and taken while giving so little back.

Yet more odious was to face the truth that she did not know how to pay back any of it.

What could pay with, her blood? House Tredegar had been struck from the rolls, its holdings seized and the only wealth Angharad had to her name was handouts from her uncle and the Watch. She could not pledge a sword hand bedridden, and even when she left that bed how much would that steel truly be worth? Blades and muskets were not rare things, on Tolomontera, and neither were skilled hands to wield them. And spirits, what else was there to her?

Even her contract was-

Her contract. Angharad licked her lips. Her small glimpses, they were a fine tool but not of much use to anyone but her. But the gate she and the Fisher had opened on the Dominion, the visions that went down the winding path? Those could be of worth to others.

If they knew about them.

If Angharad abandoned, at least to the Thirteenth, the delicate conceit that her contract was about heightened reflexes. If she put her life in their hands, for sooner or later they would learn that foretelling contracts were forbidden under pain of death in Malan – and Angharad would return to Malan, there could be no doubt of that. For revenge, and for her father.

Angharad Tredegar closed her eyes, biting the inside of her cheek, and warred with herself. A blind and cruel horse, Ferranda had called fate. She might be right about that, Angharad thought.

But it still had a saddle on, for those willing to ride.

—

There were so many clocks in the solar it felt like they were growing out of the walls.

Fancy sorts made of gold and shaped like a pearl-inlaid music box, simple brass tickers, hanging dials and even an overlarge hourglass on a hinge you could flip. The ticking was like a dull, constant roll enveloping you from every direction. Fortunately, Professor Sizakele was interesting enough a teacher that the noise tended to fade into the background.

“Asphodel, huh.”

The professor was, at the moment, forty years old. From twenty to fifty she did not change all that much in body shape, save for filling her loose back robes in slightly different places. The hair grew, though, which was why she kept bound it in elaborate crisscrossing ribbons.

“I know little of the gods of the Rectorate,” Tristan said. “The few Asphodelians I met swore by no great names.”

The professor snorted, leaning back into her large cushion chair. It suited her well as a grown woman, but when a girl of ten her shoes barely reached the edge.

“That’s because the Rectorate has no great gods,” Professor Sizakele told him. “Do you consider yourself pious, Tristan?”

“I’ve never met a god more reliable than a good set of lockpicks,” he said.

Fortuna had wandered off to have a look at whatever petty devilry Cozen was up to, so he could afford to say this without retribution.

“Good, good,” the professor smiled. “Because the Orthodoxy’s just an old racket.”

He coughed in surprise at the bluntness of that.

“It got dressed up in nice clothes over the centuries, but at the core it’s just a list of the gods that agreed to play by Second Empire rules. Those that wouldn’t bow and scrape, pay obeisance to Liergan being the heart of the world…”

She slid a finger across her throat.

“The empire killed gods?” Tristan asked, surprised.

All gods not surrendered to the night were welcome in the Orthodoxy, that was what the priests always said.

“By the shovelful,” Professor Sizakele said. “Not so many when they were consolidating their hold on Issa, but by the time they began expanding north into the Trebian Sea the emperors had grown heavy-handed. Asphodel was a regional power, back then, so it they were particularly thorough.”

He cocked his head to the size.

“So they killed the gods that could be trouble,” he said.

A cocked eyebrow was turned on him.

“Say the rhyme, boy,” Sizakele ordered.

He almost rolled his eyes, but at her current age that might get his finger slapped with the stick. Instead he cleared his throat.

“Salt and silver,

both harm the lesser

while river and line,

will bar the divine

but only bane and guile,

can slay the vile.”

The dark-skinned woman nodded in approval.

“There you have it,” she said. “A god manifest can be shot, but all that does is kill the face on a concept. Men keep praying, so another will form. The Second Empire was not so half-hearted: they slew the gods, sure enough, but then they brought over their own to fill those empty boots.”

“The Second Empire fell centuries ago,” Tristan pointed out. “What happened to those imported gods after?”

“Most broke and went rampant,” Sizakele said. “It’s no coincidence that the old rectors of Asphodel granted the Watch the right to run a private fortress on their land. Nowadays it’s more of a supply depot, but there was a time gods needed hunting in those lands.”

“So young gods would have the run of the roost, now,” he said.

“Some of them bearing old names, but that’s the truth of it,” she agreed. “It doesn’t help that the foundation of Asphodel is cracked.”

He cocked an eyebrow.

“Marble and grain are what Asphodel’s known for,” he said. “They still sell well as far as I know.”

Sizakele dismissed his words with a wave.

“That’s trade,” she said. “Stripe concerns. Why does Asphodel call itself a rectorate instead of a duchy, like their old rivals in Rasen do?”

“The capital was built out of some sort of ancient Antediluvian place of learning, or so the word goes,” Tristan said. “What does that matter?”

“Because First Empire fiddled with the fabric of the aether on Asphodel, as it their wont,” Professor Sizakele told him. “They are said to have made it stable, almost stale, and they left the aether devices ensuring this behind when they were chased out of the region by the Old Night. The Antediluvian libraries and the machinery were what made Asphodel a power to reckon with, once upon a time.”

“Only then the Second Empire rolled in,” Tristan finished.

And the Lierganen’s approach to conquest might be called magpie-like, if magpies dabbled in the occasional mass grave.

“They took everything that wasn’t nailed down and a few things that were,” Professor Sizakele confirmed. “Including much of that old machinery. The aether on Asphodel has been volatile ever since – prone to inducing flashpan gods instead of letting them coalesce properly.”

“Weak gods, then,” he tried.

“And lots of petty scavengers,” she said. “That’s nothing to celebrate for your brigade: gods are never as dangerous as when they are hungry and desperate.”

“But such lesser deities will be harmed by salt munitions and silver,” Tristan said. “They can be killed.”

“For a given value of killed,” Sizakele said. “If you kill Asphodel’s god of wealth, it will die. But what forms to replace it will have a lot in common, perhaps even the same name. The only way for a god to truly, fully stay gone-”

“Is conceptual poison,” Tristan finished.

Bane and guile, the rhyme called it. Killing the very concept at the heart of a god, either by tricking into acting against its nature or forcefully subjecting it to its ‘bane’. Like water for a god of fire, war for a god of peace. Conceptual harm had an echo in the aether, so it had lasting effects.

“So it is,” Professor Sizakele said. “Though if you’ve grown so bold as to interrupt me when I talk, it is time we moved on to a fresh set of lessons.”

She rose from her chair, went rifling through the closest clock-laden shelves and produced a large leather-bound volume that she loudly dropped on the table before him. Tristan squinted but there was no title on the surface.

“And this is?”

“Maduna’s Compendium of Banes,” Professor Sizakele viciously smiled. “We best get started, there’s a few hundred pairs for you to memorize.”

—

Maryam had not set foot in the Abbey since that first day.

Why bother, when the boons of the place would never be enough for her to reach a second year at Scholomance? Now, though, things were different. And not just because the senior signifier of Tolomontera was accompanying her down the stairs circling the endless pit of dark.

The ten rings in her pocket weighed less than a knife, but to her they felt heavy as all the world.

At Captain Yue’s instruction she kept descending, past the cell that had her number on it and down into the depths of the dark. All the way down to the bottom, where the silence grew oppressively loud and even the scuff of her boots against dusty stone felt like a scream. The last room was not a room: it was a long, broad stripe of stone extending into a dark nothing like a hanging tongue.

The absence of a guard rail should have unsettled her, given how it meant a single slip was all it took to fall into the abyss, but there was something… solid about the darkness here. Settled. Captain Yue clicked her tongue.

“I’ll never get used to this place,” she said. “The Gloam is too tame here, it’s unsettling.”

The older woman’s words felt too loud in the quiet, almost painful to the ear. Maryam swallowed.

“Why not my cell?” she asked.

“It works better down here,” Yue said. “And if the pit speaks to you, I’ll be there to stop you jumping.”

“Stop me from what?” Maryam croaked out.

“Not wasting my time, evidently,” Captain Yue said, rolling her eyes. “Go on, then. We don’t have all day and there’s not long left before you leave on that galleon – if adjustments are needed, I must know today.”

She grimaced and looked away. This fresh horror aside, Yue was not wrong about time growing tight. Not only a week and three days were left before she was to sail away on the Gallant Enterprise. Maryam breathed out, reaching into her pocket. She put on five rings, at first, each of them with a band of cryptoglyphs on the outside and a number engraved on the inside. Her left hand weighed down with brass, she reached for her nav.

The daily practice was paying off: her soul-effigy moved swiftly and precisely, more a dip pen than a brush. She wrapped the thread of nav around the rings in a simple but strong pattern, a five-wheel pulley pulled tight. Short of how much it’d take before the entity pulled back, but not much.

“Trace,” Captain Yue instructed. “Give me a Sphere first.”

Her hand moved, trailing Gloam, and she almost let out an incredulous laugh at how easy tracing the Sign was. Even easier than it had been in the layer. The sphere of pure Gloam formed with a pop, Yue letting out a hum of approval at the indication the working was hermetic.

“Release,” Yue said, and Maryam flicked her wrist.

The Gloam dispersed like scattered smoke.

“Six rings now,” the scarred captain instructed. “We need to find your first ceiling.”

Maryam had been told that in time she would be able to weave in another ring with but a little effort, but she was not yet there. She had to undo the entire spool of nav, put on the sixth ring and only then trace anew. Another Sphere, just as easily crafted – though Maryam almost felt like the Gloam came too easily.

“Seven,” Yue said.

She did not even make it to tracing before the entity began to fight her. Though it felt as if her hands should be pulled to and fro, that was a deception of her mind – her brain expecting physical consequences to a purely metaphysical struggle. Yet she still clenched her fingers, gritting her teeth as she struggled to keep her focus while the entity pulled wildly against the rake-rings. She could feel its anger, its fear.

She could feel when it cut itself struggling, the force pulling suddenly going slack afterwards as it fled.

Captain Yue had said that the creature hurting itself would return things to Maryam, but she felt nothing of the sort. Frowning, she slid her focus down the length of her nav looking for a change while her physical hand rested on the hatchet at her belt. The touch of the steel was familiar, was-

Jakov laughed, the great bearded bear of a man adjusting her wrist as he stood behind her.

“A clean snap, little queen,” he said. “Always a clean snap, else you’ll lose your bets whether my warriors are drunk or not.”

Her knees hit the floor.

“Run,” he snarled, blood dripping down his face, crimson streaks in the beard. “Go, Maryam. Your mother swore-”

Thunder and smoke, powder, and Jakov screamed-

Palms against the stone, Maryam Khaimov emptied her stomach on the ground. Jakov. Oh gods, Jakov. The first of the captains to join the Wintersworn, the kindest. The laughing man who’d taught her to throw axes so she could win rings off of drunken warriors at feasts. He’d been so proud, when she first nailed five throws in a row. She could almost see him lying on the ground, half his skull a blackened ruin from where the cannon shot burned it.

How long had it been, since she thought of Jakov? Too long. Bile rose up in her mouth again.

Captain Yue stood there and did not say a word. Maryam did not look at her, closing her eyes until she could think of anything at all but that wild laugh forever silenced.

“Two bits of memory,” she got out. “Connected, but not close in time.”

The first from the early days, the other from the very last.

“Emotional connections will have much stronger pull than time, which the Gloam cares little for,” Captain Yue noted.

She nodded, breathing in and out. A few more heartbeats passed.

“Your first ceiling is six rings,” Yue simply said. “For now, that is the amount of power you’ll be able to operate at. If you need more you can put on further rings, but expect a fight – and this sort of backlash afterwards.”

Maryam nodded, still panting.

“Take off the seventh, we’ll drill you while on six,” the older woman instructed. “I’ve no intention of sending you out of Tolomontera before you have the novice’s arsenal firmly in hand, Maryam. We will be coming down here daily until you do.”

The novice’s arsenal: the three basic Signs taught to every signifier intending on violence. Befuddlement, an Acumenal Sign that she already had some proficiency in. The Bayonet, straightforward Ancipital violence inflicted by touch. And last of the three, Burden: a minor Didactic curse that worked most anything that could be said to live.

Even though work lay ahead of her, Maryam’s heart was beating with something like joy: a year ago, wielding anything but a sloppy Befuddlement would have been a fool’s dream.

“Let’s get to work, then,” she said, and got back on her feet.

—

First, Tristan used a baited trap.

They were simple things, uncomplicated enough he was able to build his by hand. A well-positioned weighted basket with bait hung on a string so that, when the bird pulled at the bait, the string would make basket fall down and trap it. It took about half an hour for him to adjust one of the kitchen baskets for the purpose, then just as long talking his way out of Song being very unimpressed at the kitchen table now being occupied by a pile of potatoes.

Concessions had to be made, namely peeling an unreasonable amount of said potatoes, but he got his way. The bait was laid, a bowl of carrot seeds the bird would never be able to resist, and he went to sleep in a fine mood. Excitement only rose when he padded out into the garden come morning, a curious Song following, and they found the basket tipped over. No movement inside, but he would not be fooled: he raised the basket only slightly, so the magpie could escape.

Only there was no magpie inside.

“Is that a dead mouse?” Song frowned. “I thought the bait was seeds.”

“It was,” Tristan replied, glaring at the eviscerated mouse.

Even more insulting, the bowl was emptied of the seeds that had been the actual bait.

“That is one clever magpie,” Song said admiringly.

Song, he darkly thought, was going onto the list. Tristan cracked open the book on traps he’d rented from Silumko, who was clearly gouging him on the price and enjoying every moment of it. A simple bait trap had not been enough, so he would move on to something more elaborate: a funnel trap.

That took longer to build, and involved the use of more nails and pieces of wood than he would have liked. At least both were cheap and in great supply, since the Umuthi students might well riot if it were otherwise.

The result was a little rickety, as Maryam helpfully pointed out, but it held. A funnel trap was essentially a cage made of slightly spaced planks with bait inside and an entrance that the bird could squeeze through on the way in but not on the way out. His enemy, consumed by hubris, would not be able to resist entering to feast on the bowl of carrot seeds.

“Pride,” he told Fortuna, “will be the end of it.”

She rubbed her chin.

“Do magpies even eat mice?” Fortuna asked. “Maybe it was a warning, Tristan.”

She paused.

“Like the coteries back home, you know,” she said and put on her best gritty air.

She squinted and made what she thought a grim grimace but was in practice more of a pout.

“Back off, rat, or you’ll get it like the mice.”

“It’s a bird,” he flatly.

“A bird that’s winning, though,” she pointed out.

Come morning, he found a long twig abandoned halfway through the space between two planks as well as a toppled and conspicuously empty bowl.

Another dead mouse had been shoved into the funnel trap’s entrance.

“Where is it even getting all these mice?” Song wondered, passing him a cup of peppermint tea as he stood there in mute horror. “I have seen no sign of any around the cottage.”

She paused.

“Do you think it’s hunting them out in Allazei and flying them back here after?”

“I don’t know,” Tristan muttered, “but I do know this: no matter how clever it is, it won’t be cleverer than birdlime.”

—

It would have been proper for Angharad to journey to the cottage for this talk, but though her health had starkly improved – the headaches remained, but much of the pain in her bones was gone – she found it difficult to walk for more than a minute or two at a time. And with a cane, too. The journey to the north of Port Allazei was still far beyond her without the same kind of escort helping her to the Acallar, but that escort would not be able to find the hidden cottage.

The Thirteenth had, thus, come to her instead.

They came early on seventhday, though she’d had time to break her fast with her uncle earlier still. He was gone by the time Song knocked at the door, easing it open when Angharad bade her in. Her… not quite former cabalmates looked in fine health. Song wore her regular’s uniform as neatly as she ever had, and for once Tristan looked largely free of bruises. Even the dark rings around Maryam’s eyes had thinned.

“Have you ever had churros?” Tristan cheerfully asked before she could greet them.

She blinked.

“I have not,” Angharad said.

He presented a handful of wrapped pastry sticks.

“Would you like one?” he asked. “I got too many.”

A pause.

“Though it would have been the right number if Maryam did not have opinions on cinnamon that are factually incorrect.”

“I enjoy it in moderation,” the blue-eyed woman flatly said. “That is not moderation.”

“I now wonder if I should,” Angharad gamely said.

The thief waved his pastry sticks in a manner that might have been meant to be alluring but mostly had Angharad wincing at the spill.

“Take the churro, Angharad,” Song sighed. “He’s never going to shut up about it otherwise.”

The irritation there would have been on her face a few weeks ago was so slight now she wondered if she was imagining it entirely. Angharad took one of the offered pastries, nibbling at the top. It was still warm, if barely, and though the taste was quite sweet she rather enjoyed it.

“It’s good,” she admitted.

Tristan grinned.

“See, Song, that’s three people officially on the rolls of the Thirteenth who had some. That means-”

“It is not, nor will it ever be, a brigade expense,” Song informed him.

Her face was stern, but Angharad read an undertone of amusement to her tone. It was not an argument but teasing, and the sight of it brought a pang. If she had stayed, would she… No, that thought was a dead end. No amount of stirring the cauldron would change what had gone into it. She ate another bite of her churro, which now almost tasted bittersweet.

“Please, sit,” she invited. “You have my thanks for coming.”

After they sat, she did not belabor the matter with small talk. All here were aware of why she had requested the meeting.

“I had made arrangements to leave the Thirteenth, but the situation has changed,” Angharad frankly acknowledged. “I now find myself in a position where remaining with the brigade is a better course.”

Song’s face might as well be stone, and Maryam gave no reaction save for the thinning of lips. Tristan only smiled encouragingly, but Angharad knew that was skin-deep. If Maryam refused her return he’d not hesitate a moment before supporting her.

“I am not unaware,” she continued, “that I am not making this request from a strong bargaining position.”

She paused, leaving room for someone to intervene. She was not surprised by who did.

“You’re a swordswoman who can’t use her sword,” Maryam mildly said. “What, exactly, would you be contributing if you were taken back in?”

The brush with the phrasing Angharad herself had used during the argument at the cottage did not feel like a coincidence. The noblewoman swallowed, then breathed out. Pride would not get her through this.

“I apologize,” Angharad said.

Maryam blinked.

“While I spoke no lie when we last argued,” the Pereduri continued, “I phrased the truth cruelly, and did so on purpose. It was unworthy of me and underserved by you, so I owe you an apology.”

The blue-eyed woman frowned at her.

“That is to your honor,” Maryam said, tone the faintest bit sardonic. “But it does not answer my question.”

“No,” Angharad acknowledged, “but it needed to be said nonetheless.”

She clasped her hands on her lap.

“I will be able to move around with a cane much more comfortably by the time we reach Asphodel, but is true that I will not be fighting fit for some weeks after that,” she said, fingers tightening. “Which is why I offer the use of my contract instead.”

Surprise all around. None dared cross the line and ask, regardless of the implied invitation.

“While I have implied in the past my contract relates to reflexes, this is incorrect,” Angharad said. “It lets me see what is yet to come.”

She licked her lips, heart thundering. Never before had she spoken of her bargain with the Fisher in such detail.

“Small glimpses come easily to me, mere moments ahead, but should I concentrate I am able to have a vision stretching out much further.”

“How much further?” Song quietly asked.

“You don’t know?”

Angharad’s eyes flicked to the one who had spoken: Maryam, whose face was shadowed. Not angry, but perhaps on the threshold of it. Tristan’s brow had risen as well. Ah. They would think it unfair if her own contract had been spared Song’s eyes while his own had not. With reason.

“Her contract is difficult to read,” Song replied. “As if I were looking through water. I caught words enough to know it lets her see things, but not much else.”

A pause.

“My own god advised against digging, and was uncharacteristically serious giving the advice.”

Tristan let out a low whistle, eyeing her curiously.

“You are not contracted with a second-stringer, then,” he said. “I’ll back up Song’s question – how far ahead?”

“I have seen through an entire skirmish and the beginning of the pursuit after it,” Angharad said. “Perhaps fifteen minutes in all? I expect I could go further, the span did not feel like much of a weight.”

It was only a feeling, but she suspected she could go easily twice or thrice as long. It had been the repetition that scraped her raw, not the length of the spool.

“The cultist ambush out in the woods,” Song slowly said. “When your eyes bled.”

Angharad inclined her head in agreement.

“It was the first time I used the ability. My spirit’s tutoring was… not gentle. I used it many times in a row then, but now I do not believe I could do so more than once in a day without harming myself.”

The question that followed was not of the kind she had expected.

“Malani killed all Izvoric who could foretell, when they claimed land back home,” Maryam said, voice grown cold. “Are the laws so different for your own kind?”

Angharad swallowed.

“They are not,” she said. “By the laws of the Kingdom of Malan, to hold the contract I do would see me killed.”

And that got a second round of silence. Song, she thought, must have at least suspected. Not so the others, who did not quite seem to know what to make of this. Unwilling for the quiet to stretch out into trench too wide to cross, the Pereduri spoke up.

“I would pledge the use of that vision to the brigade,” Angharad said. “Even for personal matters, if our duties should allow.”

Swallowing her pride, she bent her head.

“Please.”

It was a long moment before anyone spoke.

“I would not tolerate your refusing orders,” Song said.

“I would not ask it,” Angharad said.

Even fevered by the mara, she had been forced to concede it had been too much to ask. The silver eyed Tianxi inclined her head.

“That is a start,” she said. “But while I may be captain to the Thirteenth, I will not welcome you back into its fold against the will the others. Tristan?”

The thief shrugged.

“I’ve never had trouble with Tredegar, personally,” he said. “I won’t argue against her reenlistment, so to speak, but I won’t argue for it either. Maryam?”

Blue eyes sought Angharad’s own. She did not grimace, though it was no great pleasure to be at the mercy of someone who made no secret of their dislike for her.

“Part of me wants to make you squirm,” Maryam said, “but what would be the point? It’d be a poisonous kind of satisfaction. I’d not be holding you to account for anything, just swinging the axe for the pleasure of it.”

The Izvorica’s jaw clenched.

“Your contract, I would know the boundaries of it,” she said.

“I have yet to learn them,” Angharad admitted.

“Then I will ask up to an hour a day of you,” Maryam Khaimov replied with a twisted smile, “so that you may be subjected to tests meant to do so.”

So that was her price. Something to hold over her, a sense of mastery. She won’t use it every day, Angharad told herself. The phrasing had left the door open to infrequency. And the hard truth was that Angharad’s bargaining position was best described as ‘on her knees’.

“I swear,” Angharad said.

Maryam wrenched her eyes away, then turned to Song. With a still-clenched jaw, she nodded at the Tianxi – who held Maryam’s gaze for a long moment, as if making sure, before nodding back. Only then did she look to Angharad.

“Well then,” Captain Song Ren said. “We’ll have to see about moving your belongings back in the cottage.”

—

Imani Langa had reserved a private room for four at the Crocodilian, a tavern whose main attraction was large tables and more-than-decent food at a decent price.

The Malani likely expected Song to show up with Angharad in tow, considering their social ties, but Song would have been mightily disinclined to indulge that assumption even if the Pereduri did not now look like someone had spat on her boots whenever Imani Langa was mentioned. As the captain of the Eleventh had sent word she would be bringing Thando Fanyu with her, Song Ren in answer brought the natural enemy of both spies and nobles.

“I asked around for the basics, and if that lot were any more suspicious their own shadows wouldn’t turn their backs,” Tristan Abrascal opined. “Langa’s got dagger-hand writ all over her and Fanyu’s made too little a splash for a noble with such good connections. They’re keeping a low profile on purpose.”

Song’s lips carefully did not smile. There was a certain satisfaction in having him speak out loud the words it would be improper for him to speak. The gray-eyed Sacromontan was leaning against the wall out in the hall, arms crossed, while they waited for the tavern-keeper to return from the room.

“Rattle their cage,” she murmured. “Langa is too smooth for us to get anything out of her otherwise.”

He flicked a look her way, nodded.

“What are we after?” Tristan asked.

“Where they stand in the coming lay of the land,” Song said.

Four brigades were headed to Asphodel, and while Song believed she had a decent grasp of where the Fourth would fall and where the Nineteenth stood regarding them both, the Eleventh was yet a mystery. Imani Langa had ties to Angharad, however soured, and so did Lord Thando Fanyu. Perhaps even the sort of ties that could be used to leverage the Thirteenth now that the mirror-dancer was associated with them once more.

Knowing whether or not the Eleventh was best kept at a distance would go some way in informing which contract the Thirteenth should aim for on Asphodel.

The tavern-keeper, a dark-skinned man with a pot belly and yellowing teeth but an admittedly impressive forked beard – finely groomed, unlike the oil-smudged leather apron around his waist – peeked his head through the door a moment later.

“It is ready,” he said. “Go on in.”

The Crocodilian was not so large a tavern that the space in the back truly warranted the name of ‘private room’, Song mused. Two thirds of the edifice was the main hall with its large tables, while the rest was split in two halves by the narrow hallway they were standing in. On one side was the kitchen, busily steaming, while on the other two doors waited. At a guess, the man’s own chambers and the small, almost cramped private room they were now ushered into.

Captain Imani Langa and her second were waiting inside, neither rising as Song and Tristan entered but nodding greetings instead. They had a pitcher and clay cups on their side of the square, slightly crooked table and as the Tianxi slid into one of the rickety chairs laid out for them she answered the owner’s inquiries by ordering a cup of the Crocodilian’s infamously mediocre cider. Tristan, to her surprise, ordered a chao vegetable stir.

“Captain Song,” Imani Langa smiled at her. “It is not in the Galleries as we first discussed, but I am glad to finally share a table with you.”

Song stretched her lips and inclined her head in what might be taken as agreement.

“Circumstances demanded my attention,” she said. “I look forward to deepening our acquaintance on Asphodel, Captain Imani.”

The other Stripe inclined her head back, then half-turned towards her companion.

“If I might introduce-”

“Thando Fanyu,” Tristan slid in. “Laurel, diplomacy track. Blood ties to the top brass of the Singing Jackals.”

He leaned in.

“Any truth to the talk you tried to get in as Skiritai but couldn’t make the cut?”

Thando Fanyu was not fair of face and, just like the gold bangles hanging on his ears and the riot of rings on his fingers, it was a distraction that made him harder to read. Not so much, however, that Song missed the suppressed twitch of anger that Tristan’s words brought.

“There is not,” Thando flatly said. “You are, I believe, Tristan Abrascal of Sacromonte. The apprentice of a Mask.”

“Congratulations,” Tristan drily replied, “you can recognize an accent and add up the obvious. I’m surprised the Jackals could spare sending such a promising prospect to Scholomance.”

Thando’s eyes tightened, but the cut was not as deep – or he was mastering his temper. Either way, there was nothing to gain in pushing further right at the start. Song cleared her throat and Tristan made a point of rolling his eyes before leaning back. He was, she suspected, perhaps enjoying this a little too much.

“I have made it a point to meet with the other captains who will be heading to Asphodel,” Song said. “I believe it wise to pool information, considering what we might be headed into.”

Imani cocked her head to the side.

“And what would that be?”

She had been right earlier: Langa was too smooth. Enough so that Song could not tell whether she was behind had right now. The Malani was practiced, very much-

“Either you’re outing yourself as pretty much useless or you’re yanking us around for good reason right now,” Tristan said.

Thando Fanyu stiffened in a way that told of irritating sharply risen.

“Your manners are-”

“What someone avoiding trying to answer the question would get hung up on,” Tristan drawled. “So it’s yanking around, then, is it? You could have at least waited until I got my food if you were going to waste our time.”

Imani Langa said nothing, only cocking an eyebrow at Song. Not so easily cracked, then. A different angle was required.

“Our patron will be teaching Saga while abroad,” she shared.

“Ours will be responsible for Mandate,” Imani calmly replied.

The food and drink arrived mere moments later. Song tasted her cider – aggressively mediocre, like pressed apple with rotgut rationed in – and she kept an eye on Tristan as he began digging into his plate. Using utensils, not chopsticks. The other two sipped at their glasses of ale, but only for a moment. The talks soon resumed.

“I visited the library in the Galleries,” Imani said, “and was interested to learn some of the books I sought had already been borrowed.”

“Oh?” Song replied, giving her little to work with.

“Access to those of them without a copy would be a fine gesture,” she smiled. “A pooling of information, as you mentioned.”

“I don’t know how it’s done in Malan,” Tristan said, “but back in the City, when there’s a trade both sides offer up something.”

“Trust, Master Abrascal, is earned,” Imani said. “One gesture at a time. Demanding it is pointless.”

“I agreed,” he cheerfully said. “How’re you to earn it, then? I’m all ears.”

“We called for this meeting in good faith,” Thando began, tone harsh, “If you-”

And Song learned, watching with mild horror, exactly why Tristan had ordered the chao vegetablestir. Almost all of those had peas, and as Thando Fanyu spoke the thief’s hand wielding the fork ‘slipped’. The oily pea bounced off the table, landing on the nobleman’s sleeve, and there was a heartbeat of stillness.

“Oops,” Tristan insincerely said.

From the corner of her eye Song saw Thando’s hand twitch towards the knife at his side, but her gaze was resting where it should be: on Imani Langa’s face. As she watched the Malani glance at her second, who was on the edge of crossing a line, Song got the barest glimpse of the calculations taking place behind those dark eyes.

Imani did not want to break with the Thirteenth, even though Tristan was causing the incident and her own second was the one being provoked.

“Thando,” she said, putting a hand on his arm. “Do not.”

Her gaze turned back to Song’s side of the table, cooled.

“I expected better of the Thirteenth, given how well Angharad spoke of you.”

Song’s hand itched to drum against the table, but there were witnesses. She could not indulge.

“Interesting,” Song said. “She has hardly said a word about you, Captain Imani.”

The Tianxi rose to her feet. She had what she’d come here for.

“Tempers have frayed, for which I apologize on behalf of my cabalist,” Song said. “Still, it might be best if we reconvened another day.”

“Agreed,” Imani Langa replied.

“Come, Tristan,” Song said as she rose to her feet.

“Sure, sure,” he said, sliding back his chair. “You can have the rest of my plate, Thando. It’s pretty good.”

The Malani’s jaw clenched. How many times in his life had he been so casually and persistently insulted, Song wondered? Not often enough to be unaffected. A useful weakness to keep in mind. This time she turned a stern look she actually meant on the thief, as there was no reason to continue pulling at the man. Tristan only smiled innocently, following her out as she offered the Eleventh a polite parting nod.

They were hardly four steps past the closed doors when Song hummed.

“Did you catch it?” she asked.

He folded his hands behind his neck, walking besides her.

“Langa wants something to do with us,” Tristan said. “Enough to let my prodding go when she could have leveraged it instead.”

He paused.

“The whole thing reeks, Song.”

“To the very Heavens,” she agreed. “I think it might be time for us to take a closer look at the Eleventh.”

“My thoughts exactly,” Tristan hummed. “Give me a few days and I’ll see what I can dig up.”

Song nodded, eyes gazing ahead. Pieces were missing, but she could already tell: there was blood in the water. It only remained to see who was the shark and who was the meal.

—

It was to be their last night at the cottage.

Given that the Gallant Enterprise was to leave on the early tide, it had been judged wiser for them to spend the following night at the Rainsparrow Hostel. It meant that Tristan had only one last shot at victory before he was made to slink off abroad in defeat, like some disgraced Someshwari general. It was why he was lying down in the bushes, hidden under a carpet of leaves.

“And you are quite certain,” Tredegar murmured, “that this is a magpie and not a spirit?”

The noblewoman was supposedly from a line of distinguished hunters on her father’s side, so she had been brought in as an advisor. She was sitting in the bush to his left mostly, as far as he could tell, because she wanted to avoid Song. Angharad’s reluctance to talk to their captain seemed to spring from the discomfort of not truly wanting to be under her command while being aware her return had been somewhat of a favor, a disparity she was not navigating with a surfeit of grace.

Maryam thought it was a good laugh to watch, though, so arguably morale-wise it evened out.

“Song confirmed it’s not a god or a lemure,” he replied.

“Song cannot see what is inside an animal,” Angharad said. “Or a woman, for that matter.”

Right, that misstep with the mara. Intriguing that the mirror-dancer had decided to wander into the Witching Hour when she should know the risks, but that wasn’t his trouble. Layers did not grow on trees, he doubted there would be any for her to repeat that stupidity with on Asphodel.

“You think it’s possessed?” he asked.

“I believe that even for a magpie, admittedly clever birds, it displayed great cunning,” Angharad said. “Perhaps too much of it. Whether ‘tis possession or something else, I cannot say.”

He chewed on that for a long moment.

“It only worked around traps out in the open,” he finally said. “Obvious ones, in a way. If it is only a bird the birdlime will be enough.”

She wrinkled her nose. The noble must not have found the use of that sporting, which it was not. Birdlime was, well, in practice that varied from place to place but the gist of it was that it was a sticky substance you could spread on a surface that’d catch the bird when it landed on it. The poor man’s recipe was the one made of holly bark, but that took most a night boiling then weeks stocked in a moist place. Tristan had sprung for a recipe with oil and turpentine instead, which did not need anywhere as much handholding to be usable.

He’d made enough to lay a flawless trap out in the garden: he’d put out a large flat rock, covered the thing in birdlime and then set down a small wooden bowl full of seeds on it. There would be no tipping that bowl, and no feeding on it without landing on the rock. The magpie’s hours were numbered.

“Oh,” Angharad breathed, pressing herself down against the grass. “There it is.”

She was right. The magpie had landed in the grass, barely a foot away from the baited stone, and it was hopping around. This was the best look Tristan had gotten of his enemy, and despite having known of it in principle he was still surprised by the bird’s size. Magpies were smaller than crows, at least the kind in Sacromonte, while this one was the size of cat. And not small cat, either. It was a handsome creature, its feathers lustrous and the streak of white on its sides and back of elegant cut.

It was also sniffing at the birdlime, as if suspicious.

“Either Malani magpies are much smaller than other breeds,” Angharad noted, “or that creature reeks of spirit.”

“It’ll take the bait,” Tristan insisted.

He’d not even finished the sentence before the magpie flew off. Angharad’s face was so forcefully solemn she might as well have burst out laughing. Tristan, gathering the dregs of his dignity, hazarded the theory that it might return. And it did! It returned to drop a large piece of dry bark on the limed stone. It then landed on the bark, pushing down on it as if experimentally, and let out a triumphant cackle-call before gorging itself on the carrot seeds in the bowl.

“I should have brought a musket,” Tristan darkly said.

Tredegar cleared her throat.

“Have you much improved your shooting of late?” she delicately asked.

“This is why you keep getting into duels, Angharad,” he informed her, then cleared his throat. “But point taken.”

He might have managed with grapeshot, but he wasn’t getting a cannon up those stairs alone. Or getting a cannon at all, unless he robbed the garrison fort. Or a ship. Huh, a ship might be doable. The thief considered the smug magpie, so cocksure in its temporary victory. It’d never see grapeshot coming. At this point he was coming around to the notion that this might not be your average sort of magpie, so it might be argued to be his duty as a valiant man of the Watch to take care of the situation.

“Have you considered negotiating with the spirit?”

He turned a stern look on the noblewoman.

“Angharad,” he said. “This creature has ravaged my fields, destroyed my works-”

“Traps,” she drily said. “It broke your traps.”

“Destroyed my works,” he sternly repeated, “and massacred presumably innocent rodents. You would negotiate with this fiend?”

“Sometimes,” Angharad gravely said, “we must make compromises with the night.”

She beamed at him expectantly, as if expecting him to be impressed.

“Treason, then,” he grimly said.

An odd flicker in her eye, then a half-forced smile.

“I do not think you will catch that bird with a bullet,” she told him. “Try as you will, of course, but were I you I would attempt an offering instead.”

He hummed, considering her still oddly serious face. Considering what he had read about Tredegar’s father in her dossier, she might actually be giving out good advice. He also recalled there’d been campfire talk about how many of the maze gods took to her, during the Trial of Ruins.

“I am almost out of seeds anyhow,” Tristan said. “I suppose at this point there is little to lose.”

He headed back inside with her, bravely facing Maryam’s cuttingly arched eyebrows as he took their nicest bowl, the ceramic one with the nice Izcalli wave patterns, and filled it with a third of the remaining carrot seeds. There was no trace of his foe when he returned alone – Angharad had elected to watch from inside, removing herself from the negotiations – save for the sight of the empty bait bowl.

Ceremoniously he made his way to the center of the garden, putting down the bowl with a bow and then sitting in the dirt out of reach.

“God of the land,” he called out, “I come to bargain.”

He sat there in silence for what to be a solid five minutes, mustering patience, before there was another of those short cackle-calls. The large bird flew out of the trees a minute later, landing on the other side of the bowl. As if they were seated on different sides of a table. Tristan’s lips twitched.

“It has come to my attention that-” he began, then frowned. “How much do you actually understand, truly?”

The magpie trilled.

“You can’t be a god,” he noted. “Song would have seen it. So… a possessed bird, some Gloam-warped magpie?”

The magpie hopped left, then right, and picked at the rim of the nice bowl.

“Terms, then,” Tristan conceded. “I would like you to stop eating the seeds I sow.”

Skeptical trilling.

“In exchange,” the thief offered, “I will fill this bowl with seeds once a week.”

The magpie kicked the nice Izcalli bowl, rattling it a bit. Tristan sneered.

“You’re not going to walk,” he said. “I could just stop sowing carrots, and where does that leave you?”

Cackle-call answered him.

“Fine,” the gray-eyed man muttered. “I’ll also leave out an apple every two weeks. How about that?”

The magpie hopped back and forth, then trilled – and took flight.

“It appears negotiations have broken down,” Tristan said.

He’d have to look into how much a cannon cost. Not a naval one, one of those smaller ones you put on a wooden support and could aim with a single man. Those could probably load grapesh- the thief almost topped forward from the sudden weight, wings flapping against his ear. He yelped ,covering his head as the magpie messed up his hair and dug its sharp talons into his uniform. Having made itself comfortable at his expense, it then stayed there.

Having no apparent intention of leaving.

“It occurs to me,” Tristan said, “that we might not have been having the same conversation on both ends.”

The magpie trilled into his ear, mussing at his hair with a wing. Gods the thing was heavy. Not as much as Mephistofeline, but then that was true of most ship anchors.

“Are we… allies?” Tristan hazarded.

A cackle-call. That seemed confirmation enough.

“You’ll need a name, then,” he said.

A pause.

“Rations,” he suggested.

The beak cruelly pecked at his scalp until he put up his hands in surrender. It was, clearly, clever enough to realize some implications. Or at least read his sense of mischief.

“Something that will make everyone else uncomfortable, then,” he mused, and there was a trill of approval.

Half an hour later, when Song strode into the garden angrily asking why her favorite bowl was missing and the bedrooms reeked of turpentine, she found him stroking the oversized preening magpie in his lap. It has very soft feathers.

“What is this?” Song asked.

“This,” Tristan proudly said, “is Sakkas. He’s with us now.”

Sakkas let a trill of agreement.

“No,” she flatly denied. “Change the name.”

“Too late,” Tristan grinned, “he’s taken to it now.”

The magpie let out a pleased cackle-call, Song blanched and Tristan only grinned wider. Yes, he decided as he stroked his bird, this would do nicely. It would do nicely indeed.

# Chapter 40

The galleon cast a long shadow across the dock, all of them waiting standing within it.

It was barely three in the morning, and though Tristan was not unused to keeping night hours few of his companions shared the habit. Maryam kept leaning against him, half falling asleep on her feet, and he could only roll his eyes. Had she refrained from visiting the Abbey last afternoon she would be better rested, but now that Captain Yue had given her those eerie rings that helped with her Signs she was near obsessed with practice.

Tredegar shuffled to his left, earning a curious glance as he absent-mindedly caught Maryam’s sleeve so she would not tip over. The dark-skinned noble had been uneasy since they left the Rainsparrow Hostel, tightly wound enough she’d looked like she wanted to decline when sailors had come down the ramp to take their bags onto the ship. There was something up with Tredegar these days, and he was growing increasingly sure it wasn’t some petty schoolyard affair.

Someone laughed closer to the water, one of the instructors. Sound carried far out here, and the Allazei docks were somehow both empty and swarming. There were but a handful of garrison soldiers keeping an eye from their posts by the docks, but the great galleon called the Gallant Enterprise was a hive of activity – though now that the black-clad sailors had brought in all the crates it was the ship’s deck that was the heart of it.

Not that the Thirteenth was alone on the docks, far from it, for all that the talk was sparse and quiet. Odds were that they’d only be sharing a ship with the others on the dock for a few days, but Tristan still found them worth assessing.

Captain Wen had made it clear that should some disaster strike the student brigades could call on the Asphodel watchmen or the diplomatic flotilla, doing so without a great need would wreck their performance on the yearly test. The only people the Scholomance cabals would be able to call on were the instructors and each other. In other words, the muster that’d showed up here would be the available roster for their time abroad.

He was far from the only one to have realized that. Song had been reading everyone’s contracts from under the brim of her hat and the others were looking at the Thirteenth just as intently – if without magic silver eyes. It was just the four of them standing together, too, as their patron had abandoned them in favor of an omelet cornet and ‘conversation with people I actually like’.

Some of those out there Tristan was passingly familiar with.

The Fourth kept clannish distance from everyone else, almost glaring, but Tristan noticed they were less skittish with each other than they had been at the start of the year. If Bait was to be believed the monthly fights for who got to have a name were mostly halfhearted formalities nowadays and the unpleasant names stuck on them had been used so much any sting had long been sanded off.

Tupoc caught him looking and stared back with unblinking pale eyes, subtly mouthing ‘in your sleep’ before slicing a finger across his throat. Charming as ever.

A new detail about the Fourth was how their patron, Lieutenant Mitra, was standing with them staring off at the distance. The Someshwari was narrow-faced but broad-shouldered, mostly standing out because of his unkempt hair and beard – both which spread about in long, disorderly strands. He also looked rather gloomy, helped along by eyes bearing dark circles. A glint of light caught on the ring he bore, prompting Tristan shake Maryam awake and discreetly gesture that way.

“Does the ring mean anything?

She blinked at him a moment, smacking her lips, and only then actually began seeing the things around her.

“Um,” she eloquently replied. “Silver is the mark of a Master of the Guild?”

He cocked an eyebrow, his next question silent. He was no Akelarre, to know whether a ‘Master’ should be counted some grand dignitary or messenger boy.

“The captain on the Bluebell was a master as well,” Maryam said, blue eyes now fully awake.

At that he hummed, nodding his thanks. Captain Sfizo had supposedly kept a horde of crazed lares from continuing to flood the ship before almost casually caging the Saint – though admittedly only after several had wounded it for him. Still. Lieutenant Mitra was not one to trifle with, then. Hage had once mentioned that most Akelarre did not take up ranks higher than captain by old custom, preferring to sort themselves by hidden ranks inside their guild instead.

Song leaned in close to both of them, pitching her voice low.

“This Qianfan, you know him?”

Their gazes moved to the brigade standing closest to the Fourth, the Eleventh. That one bore relatively few surprises, but the Tianxi just mentioned had been one.

Captain Imani Langa and Thando Fenya were mostly accounted for, as was their Skiritai hatchet man: a Sacromontan by the name of Salvador who Tristan would be giving a very wide berth. The man reeked of coterie in all the worst ways, and Tredegar apparently holding in him high esteem from shared Skiritai classes only made him deadlier to the rat’s eye. A killer who knew when to keep it in the sheath was twice as dangerous.

Their fourth member was the aforementioned Qianfan, a tall Tianxi boy – and a Navigator student, hence Song’s question to Maryam.

“Barely in passing,” Maryam replied. “He’s one of the most frequent visitors to the Abbey cells.”

Like the Thirteenth, the Eleventh had been abandoned by their patron – he was one of the two chatting with Wen, a heavyset Lierganen man with a shaved head and face displaying fierce jowls and the broken jaw of a street tough. A deceptive appearance, as Lieutenant Joaquin was from the Peiling Society and a mathematician of some repute as well as their designated Mandate instructor.

That decision was made all the more interesting by the identity of the third patron in that little circle: Captain Oratile was a Stripe, the patron to the Nineteenth and also the chosen Teratology instructor. That the dark-skinned Academician would not be the one teaching them Mandate had come as something of a surprise.

The Nineteenth seemed surprised when she left them behind to join the other patrons, perhaps hinting at a soft hand overseeing them. Tristan looked that way the least, for… practical reasons. Tredegar cleared her throat softly, dark eyes staring the Nineteenth’s way, and he almost winced in advance.

“That girl is still glaring at you,” Tredegar told him.

Cressida Barboza, as it turned out, had not gotten the last Aetheric Warfare slot or forgiven him for his role in that outcome. Their captain wasn’t getting involved, at least – Tozi Poloko, she of the ridiculous haircut and lying eyes. Song liked the Izcalli officer some, but something about her reminded Tristan of those merchants that gouged desperate youths on bread prices and made it seem like a favor all the while.

Beside the captain towered Izel Coyac, a broad-shouldered man with powerful arms and stubble for hair. Umuthi, Tristan had learned when he asked around, and regarded by other tinkers as both a skillful hand with a tool and a rather friendly fellow. Going by the hairlessness and what he suspected were bindings under the tunic at chest height, Coyac was also corregido – a man once believed a woman.

The last of them, Kiran Agrawal, was another of Tredegar’s seemingly endless Skiritai acquaintances. The Someshwari spearman was friendly enough he’d come over to greet her, and he had the grooming habits of someone born to coin. No one else kept their beard and mustache that neat. Mind you, the jewelry alone would have told Tristan that: it looked like real gold. Song had quietly noted him to be a contractor, though she’d not elaborated.

“Pretend you don’t notice,” Tristan whispered back.

“A spurner lover, Tristan?” Tredegar teased. “Already?”

Much as he balked in being made a figure of fun by someone who had thought Isabel Ruesta was in any way a good idea, getting scathing would only draw attention to them.

“We had a slight disagreement over class scheduling, that’s all,” he vaguely replied. “Nothing too heated.”

“That is not a heatless glare, Tristan,” Tredegar told him. “I have some expertise in spurned glaring, and would rank this firmly in the upper half of the species.”

“How is Captain Imani, Angharad?” Song mildly asked.

The Pereduri coughed into her fist, looked away and commented on the mildness of the breeze so early in the morning. Tristan shot Song and grateful look that she pretended not to notice, then let his attention drift to the last pair waiting on the docks. They stood away from the other instructors close to the ramp leading onto the galleon.

Commander Osian Tredegar, Angharad’s uncle, was one of those roguishly fashionable types that infanzonas would cause a minor society scandal with before setting aside for a more respectable marriage. He was rich but also an Umuthi, which was a shame because Tristan was not fool enough to try lifting the gold of someone who could make aether traps. Rather amusingly, Commander Tredegar had been trying to get out of a conversation for the last fifteen minutes but the other side was not taking the hint.

Sergeant Kavia was a short, middle-aged Someshwari whose rank was suspiciously low. Her looks were unremarkable and her black hair kept in a bun, but she bore a bejeweled shield on her back along with two swords at her hip and one of those strange bladed Someshwari circles called chakram. That one had Skiritai written all over her, in Tristan’s opinion.

Alas, whether or not Commander Tredegar would eventually be able to escape with dignity from that conversation was to remain unknown, as shouts from above ended their common wait. A Watch officer on the deck of the galleon shouted for them to come aboard and be received by the commodore, which gave the older Tredegar an excuse to hurry up the ramp. The rest of them began to follow after.

“There should still be an instructor missing,” Song frowned.

Tristan almost smiled. He could understand why she’d believe that, as nearly all of their shared classes and the covenant ones had a face to them. Lieutenant Mitra for Theology and the Akelarre, Lieutenant Joaquin for Mandate and the Savants, Captain Oratile for Teratology and the Stripes. Even Captain Wen for Saga and the Laurels – poor Thando, sole Arthashastra student and about to inherit Wen’s full attention for hours at a time.

Sergeant Kavia should be covering Warfare and the Skiritai, which left Commander Tredegar for the Umuthi and thus one seat glaringly empty.

“I’d be rather surprised,” Tristan said, “if the Mask were not already aboard.:

—

It was tradition for the captain to welcome passengers aboard, and Song suspected that most would have been eager to rub elbows with the collection of covenanter instructors boarding the Gallant Enterprise even should they be disciplined to humor mere students. Commodore Trivedi instead looked at them all as if they were a tedious chore. Either the woman was well-connected enough to think the passengers beneath her, or commodore was likely the highest rank she would ever attain.

Competence alone was not enough to make it into admiralty ranks.

“Welcome aboard,” Commodore Trivedi blandly said. “My officers will bring you to your quarters. Accommodations will be made for your… classes, but I will not brook any wandering around and getting in the way of my men.”

She paused, forced a half-hearted smile.

“I may extend dinner invitations, should time allow. Dismissed.”

Some of the instructors seemed amused, others irked, but it was Captain Tozi that drew Song’s eye. There was something like contempt in the other woman’s gaze. They did not linger on deck, however, for Commodore Trivedi’s word was law on her own ship – and another few, as she led the entire diplomatic flotilla headed to Asphodel. Naval lieutenants escorted them into the belly of the beast, Song taking in every scrap of detail she could. And one truth became obvious quick enough.

Unlike the last galleon they had been on, the Gallant Enterprise was a fighting ship.

It was not a groaning old dog coming apart at the seams but a modern warship with fortified decks and forty gleaming culverin cannons. There were around hundred sailors crewing it and by the looks of it almost as many soldiers.

The students were promptly assigned quarters above the cargo hold, splitting three cabins between them. Luck of the draw had the Thirteenth score one of the smaller private ones and the Nineteenth the other, thus inflicting the sharing of close quarters with Tupoc onto the Eleventh. Song offered the gods due thanks for this, burning an offering to Menshen Zhu for having kept both evil spirits away from her door.

She bunked above Angharad while Tristan took the bed below Maryam’s, the four of them unpacking their affairs as much as they intended to for the length of the trip. Beyond a short stop at the port Lavega, where the Gallant was to link up with the rest of the flotilla, it was not planned for the ship to make landfall before reaching Asphodel – meaning they’d be splitting their time between this room, the dining hall and whatever could be borrowed for teaching purposes.

Wen knocked at their door shortly after, informing them they were to return to sleep but that there would be a wake-up call in a few hours. The instructor had agreed that classes were not to be skipped even on the first day. There was no argument from the Thirteenth, Maryam’s short spurt of wakefulness already turning to smoke, and they gladly collapsing onto their narrow bunks after snuffing out the lamp.

Song woke when the ship passed through the Ring of Storms, the noise and movement stirring her out of sleep, but she went back to sleep before they were even through.

At the seventh hour Captain Wen hammered at their door, tossing a bag full of grain biscuits and salted meat when Angharad sleepily opened the door. The Pereduri narrowly caught it.

“Water barrels are down the hall,” Wen told them. “You have forty-five minutes to ready for class.”

They rushed to eat and dress, Song and Angharad padding away to the barrels to wash – a handful of the others were there as well, looking as if the manner of their awakening had been no gentler than the Thirteenth’s. Song returned with a clean face and neck but to a sight that had her wondering if she was still asleep: Tristan, sitting on his bed, was feeding a rotund black cat a piece of biscuit from the pack.

“Is that Mephistofeline?”

“It’s either that or one of the lard cuts grew fur,” Tristan replied.

Mephistofeline, indifferent to the insult, kept eating up the crumbs and biting at his fingers.

“Well,” Song muttered, “I suppose we know who your instructor will be now.”

“And Cressida Barboza’s as well,” the thief muttered. “That I could have done without.”

There was a loud snore as Maryam twisted in her covers, arm slipping past the edge of the bunk bed and hanging loose.

“You let her go back to sleep,” Song accused.

“She cursed at me in her native tongue,” he drawled back. “I’m not getting anywhere near her when she does that – not as long as she sleeps with a hatchet under her pillow, anyway.”

The silver-eyed Tianxi sighed.

“Fine, I’ll take care of it,” she said.

There was an unloaded musket to use as a stick. Song paused when reaching for it.

“That biscuit is coming out of your share, by the way,” she said.

He snorted.

“If you’d tried one, you would know it’s not great loss.”

Ship rations rarely were any good, admittedly. It was a narrow thing, but Song was able to ensure her brigade was awake, dressed and not starving by the time Sergeant Kavia came to gather everyone. She counted the heads, as if they were sheep returning from a wander, and then led them through the depths of the ship. There she bade them good luck and knocked at the door.

And that was how seventeen students found themselves crammed into a small room smelling vaguely of anchovies just before the turn of eight, as the door had opened to reveal the rictus grin of one Captain Wen Duan. Saga, it seemed, was to be the first class.

—

None of the other students had dealt with Wen before, save for Tupoc, and it showed from the sheer amount of baffled, offended and sympathetic looks that the Thirteenth received within five minutes of everyone being stuck in a room with the man.

The Eleventh was told to sit further back because Captain Imani was ‘too distractingly Uthukilen’, Tupoc was complimented on having managed to trick so many people into listening to him since they’d last met and Captain Tozi Poloko’s surname was almost certainly deliberately mangled in pronunciation. Not that the Thirteenth was spared, as Maryam was informed he’d known livelier corpses. After rounds of insults barely camouflaged as him taking attendance, to Song’s relief the captain actually deigned to begin teaching them something.

“While you are all living monuments to staggering levels of ignorance about the world around you,” Captain Wen Duan casually said, “I’m not paid anywhere near enough to put in even a token effort in mending that sad reality.”

He reached behind his bench, taking out a bulky cloth sack and setting it on his knees before pushing his glasses.

“We’ll settle for you gaining a modicum of understanding about the nation we are all sailing to.”

Untying the ropes around the head of the bag, he reached insides. The better part of seventeen gazes followed the gesture.

“We’ll start with the basics,” Captain Wen said. “Can one of you tell me what the capital of Asphodel Rectorate is?”

Hands rose, Song’s one of them, but she paid closer attention to the faces than who Wen would pick. Captain Tozi was no surprise, and neither was Thando Fenya – he was a Laurel, after all. More interesting was Alejandra Terrero from the Fourth. Not all Navigators concerned themselves with the lay of the seas, but it seemed like Tupoc’s signifier might be one of them.

“Fenya,” Wen said. “Amaze me.”

“Tratheke,” Lord Thando said. “The name is derived from words in the Cycladic cant meaning ‘singing box’.”

A noise of approval. Wen reached inside the bag, producing a small orange.

“Tratheke is where we will dock and where three out of four assessment tests will take place,” he said.

He then turned a look on Thando.

“Here,” the bespectacled man said. “Have a praise orange.”

To the Malani’s honor, he caught the orange that Wen tossed him and mostly hid his confusion. He best start getting used to the feeling, as Thando Fenya was the only Arthashastra Society student headed to Asphodel and thus he would be suffering the undiluted Wen Duan dosage during the afternoons.

Song almost pitied him for that. Almost.

“All right,” Wen said. “Now, who runs the place?”

Now that was an interesting question, she thought. In principle, the answer was the rector of Asphodel – currently Lord Rector Evander Palliades the Third, ninth ruler of the relatively recent Palliades dynasty. The Rectorate, despite the name, was effectively a monarchy in practice. The complicating factor here was that, reading between the lines of every book on Asphodel she had got her hands on, the office of rector in general and the Palliades family in particular had been losing their grip on the reins of power for the last eight decades.

Thando’s hand went up again, though it went ignored, and this time it was Tupoc’s hand that went up along Captain Tozi’s.

“Poloko,” Captain Wen said. “What have you got?”

“Lord Rector Evander Palliades,” she said, then frowned. “Second of his name.”

Wen tossed her an orange, which she caught with a pleased smile.

“Don’t go smiling, that was a shame orange for getting it wrong,” the captain told her. “Song, try to redeem your covenant.”

The look Captain Tozi turned on her for that was rather cool. Ugh, and she was the captain Song most wanted to cultivate ties to. The Tianxi cleared her throat.

“Asphodel is ruled by its lord rector, but the office is advised by the Council of Ministers, an advisory body made up from great nobles,” she said. “The Ministers have a degree of control over courts and the treasury.”

Wen only cocked an eyebrow, evidently considering the answer incomplete, so she pressed on.

“There is also the Trade Assembly, an association of the wealthiest merchants of Asphodel, whose leading magnates control the trade keeping the Rectorate afloat,” she continued. “While they have no official authority, they have a great deal of informal influence.”

The reason the Palliades were still rectors even though their blood claim was weak and there was mounting discontent was that the Ministers and the Assembly were at each other’s throats. The heart of it was about land: the nobles controlled great estates they guarded jealously, keeping the magnates from turning their wealth into power by buying land. Both sides tried to pull the Palliades their way to check their enemies, allowing the family enough leverage to continue squeaking through,

Captain Wen nodded.

“This is a praise orange,” he informed her before tossing it.

She snatched it up despite his best effort at lobbing it low enough it’d slip her grasp. Tupoc got a praise orange as well for identifying the island of Arke and its iron mines as both the source of much of Asphodel’s current wealth and the reason it had been fighting with the Duchy of Rasen regularly for the last two centuries. Captain Tozi redeemed herself by explaining that the city of Tratheke was built out of massive Antediluvian ruin, which many believed to have been a university of sorts.

Imani was thrown a shame orange for a lacking answer regarding the closest diplomatic ties of the Rectorate were – according to her, Sacromonte and the Watch.

“Sacromonte backs the Rectorate, and encourages it to fight Rasen as standing policy,” Wen agreed. “You’re right about that. But the old ties to the Watch have grown weak – Asphodel is mostly clear of monsters and the Rookery now buys grain through the City instead. Who’s stepped into that gap?”

Song knew the answer, as it was good as plainly writ in Trade in the Trebian, Ninth Sails Edition, which was why she knew the way the question had been phrased was a trap. While Thando Fenya correctly identified Tianxia as a growing trade partner for the Rectorate – the southern republics were famously gluttons for iron – he was still thrown a shame orange. Song took some small pleasure in elaborating on his answer when prompted.

“The Kingdom of Malan imports large amounts of cattle from Asphodel,” she added, “as the native breed of sheep is highly prized in the Malani heartlands.”

Something about it producing fine wool without taking sick in the warm weather. Which meant the Malani had ties to the Council of Ministers, as only the nobles had large enough estates to raise cattle on that scale. And since the Trade Assembly controlled the iron shipping to the Republics, which kept them rich enough to compete with the nobles, the magnates had ties to Tianxia. It was no wonder that the Watch believed there would soon be war in Asphodel, given that two powers stronger than the nominal ruler of the state were in bed with foreign interests.

Song knew better than to believe the Republics were anything less than cutthroat in their efforts to dominate the Trebian trade.

“Now, perhaps I am too hopeful a man but I choose to believe that the lot of you are capable of understanding the basic implications of what has been said here,” Captain Wen said. “Now, consider this: the Asphodel Rectorate has unveiled the existence of a functional Antediluvian on its home island, the capacity to build cutters and that it secured a large cache of tomic alloys.”

He paused.

“Then consider further that all of these great and mighty boons are inside land that is ruled over directly by the lord rector of Asphodel, allowing young Evander Palliades to entirely cut out the aristoi and the magnates.”

Captain Wen leaned in.

“What does that sound like to you?”

“Blackpowder,” Kiran Agrawal grimly said.

“Elaborate,” Wen said.

It was another than answered – Angharad, to Song’s mild surprise.

“A great source of revenue not hampered by the Council of Ministers would allow the lord rector to muster funds and soldiers to assert authority over the nobility again,” she said. “To call the magnates to heel would then be trivial.”

“You two can split the orange later,” Wen mused, setting it down on a barrel. “Broadly speaking, that assessment’s correct – the Palliades have a chance at ruling Asphodel in more than name again, if they survive the next few years. That Lord Rector Evander kept secret the shipyard find until the very last moment indicates he understands the dangers ahead.”

The bespectacled man rolled his shoulder.

“There will be eyes on you from the moment we dock at Trathekes,” Wen warned them. “Traditionally, the Watch can be said to be on the side of whoever holds the seat of lord rector. In practice, however, the power of the countryside aristoi means our men at Stheno’s Peak had to cultivate good relationships with them to be able to move unhindered through their lands.”

“Surely,” Bait slowly said, “neither these ministers nor magnates would try to hinder us when our contracts are to the benefit of Asphodel.”

Wen laughed.

“There’s war coming for that isle, boy,” he said. “If it looks like the Lord Rector will win it, the old nobles will reach out to their Malani friends and the merchants send letters to the Republics – they know a resurgent Palliades family will bury them. There’s not a scrap of sharp steel on Asphodel that will not be scrutinized for allegiance, and though you are students you wear the black.”

He clicked his tongue.

“Behind you stands the weight of armies and fleets, children,” he said. “Your personal opinions matter little, but these grand men will dissect your every step like augurs trying to read in such entrails the intentions of the officers above you.”

And if the Watch decided to back a faction, Song read between the lines, it might very well tip the balance their way. Malan and the Republics were powerful, but the Watch was closer – and could more easily commit more of its strength. Yet the Watch could not take sides, as Professor Iyengar had told them in that first lesson. To do so would be a poison lethal to the order.

“You will have to tread lightly,” Wen Duan said. “Which is why we’re now going to spend the rest of this morning learning names .”

Skeptical looks.

“Whose names, you ask?”

“No one asked that,” Tristan muttered.

“Ah, my first volunteer,” he happily replied. “And, of course, it is the names of every great family, trade cartel and court official on Asphodel.”

He cracked his hands.

“And in case you were wondering, every mistake will be punished.”
